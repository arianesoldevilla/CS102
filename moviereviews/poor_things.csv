"Poor Things","parksiet","31 December 2023",410,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"Poor Things","Pjtaylor-96-138044","23 January 2024",510,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy)."
"Poor Things","Billybobble1","26 February 2024",310,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in."
"Poor Things","kjproulx","6 January 2024",1010,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever."
"Poor Things","imseeg","9 December 2023",510,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!"
"Poor Things","ThereelscoopwithKK","12 March 2024",110,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive."
"Poor Things","nicko252008","24 January 2024",210,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film."
"Poor Things","aciessi","24 December 2023",910,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
"Poor Things","pd-19490","20 January 2024",110,"My previous attempts at reviewing this were declined possibly due to how I expressed my strong opinions about the movie. I will try again with as much restraint as I can and try not to insert my opinion. So here it goes. The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she still has the mind of a child. These men know she has the mind of a child and yet continue anyway. I will let you interpret that how you will. I won't watch it again. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do."
"Poor Things","MovieCriticOnline","27 February 2024",110,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this."
"Poor Things","rgxdzrybr","1 February 2024",110,"I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either."
"Poor Things","nicolasroop","22 December 2023",910,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
"Poor Things","doppleganger19692","8 February 2024",510,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it."
"Poor Things","lbenot","28 December 2023",110,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
"Poor Things","allanmichael30","10 March 2024",110,"Why is this file so vile, its main story is the innocence of a child thrown in to a adult world. The adults raising her are sick and twisted and she runs away only to be abused by a sick vile man(played by mark ruffalo) who abuses the young child and a pedophilia. After she leaves him she gets abused by men in a brothel. This film should surely win best picture as holywood ""Me too"" have surely given actresses their rights back. If this is not sick enough the child that gets abused is the baby of a mother who killed her self, well just the brain. This film would get banned, if any rating system could. The acting of william defoe was very good, how ever the plot was just weird and even had husband of dead woman wanting to have relationship with own daughter."
"Poor Things","Victor_Santamaria","27 January 2024",110,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
"Poor Things","francogrex","29 February 2024",110,"I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie."
"Poor Things","lbowdls","9 March 2024",310,"Yes I'm echoing all those who hate this film. I think it's pornographic, exploitative and degrading.And I don't even agree that the acting is hood. Emma Stone should not even have been nominated for an Oscar let alone (I hope she doesn't win it, I'm writing this two days from the Oscars) if she does to me it would be like giving an Academy award to a porn actress. And Mark Rufullo who I usually love in most things and makes good choices. But what the hell was he thinking here? William Defoe is the only one who does a great job here, but again how could he want to be in it?Some say it's beautifully filmed - no it's not - the horrible, strange colors and staging is also very disconcerting.I gave it a couple up from 1 simply due to Defoe and occasional dialogue of insights. But those insights are certainly not feminist!"
"Poor Things","reelreviewsandrecommendations","22 January 2024",910,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"Poor Things","xxxxxdarkmoon","2 March 2024",110,"This one feels off for a reason.I will tell you what that reason is, in case you overlook the obvious. According to the ratings it did happen a few times.This one (I am avoiding the term ""movie"") contains adult-only material, but that is not the problem. The problem is: that the ""monster"" has the intellect of a child if I understand it correctly. Doesn't it?Do I need to say more?Actually, this is the point where nothing more has to be said. This is distasteful. It is not recommended for sane people.This is a failed attempt at a ""comedy-drama-romance"". A sane person would not even watch the movie til the end. And by no means rate it with more than 5 stars."
"Poor Things","moviedays1","10 January 2024",110,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity."
"Poor Things","RayCharles81","28 December 2023",110,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
"Poor Things","awagne-29536","28 December 2023",110,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Poor Things","acanacox","31 December 2023",110,"Did Emma Stone take career choice lessons from her best friend: Jennifer Lawrence and claim that movies that circulate around-sex- was the new ""it"" for movies?!!!! And I thought ""No hard feelings"" was awful. But this- my oh my! Both have its merits-good actors but god awful writing! No heart what's so ever in this awful piece! I don't know what's more awkward and embarrassing~ being in that theater alone while watching it or being in a full theater and watching....but I was the one all alone so it might be more embarrassing. It's basically porn~ over and over and over. Within I'd say the first 7 min~you see male genitals, and I frowned~ she's acting 4. But the hints of snickers from myself turned into ""ok this is embarrassing"" that turned into ""oh god MORE sex?"" Which turned into ""MORE nudity?!!!""
This movie is~ EH HEMMMM if-
Tim Burton clashed with Lemony Snicket clashed with Victorian age clashing with futuristic realism clashing with Wednesday clashing with Barbie clashing with blind fashion designers, clashing with science clashing with porn and Frankenstein.....
All in all~
In the words of the great goddess herself I would like to quote~Katharine Hepburn~
""It's filth. I am disgusted with the movies. DISGUSTED! They are kidding themselves into saying it's an intellectual pastime. BUNK!""
Might be asking ""then why did you go see it-heck why did you stay until the very end?""
Because of the crazy hyped of reviews that were clearly written by teenagers it appears and I wasn't going to leave when I paid $14.....no wonder no one wants to see movies anymore in the theater~ what they're showing is garbage and no one wants to be THAT embarrassed into thinking they need to stay put because it's $14 spent.This was and had to have been made by either extremely high people~ or nymphomaniacs that don't want to actually tell a good story. You can tell a very great story without the use of alllllllll the sex! Seriously! Just look at Hollywood during the Hays Code Era!!!!It also felt they couldn't keep up with one plot, it threw in sooo many plots, ""finding out about life"" ""pleasure"" ""love"" ""emotions"" ""Victorian tragedy"". I felt like they tried to clump in 20 years of education down not only Bella's throat but mine as well. Learning as to why men torture women for pleasure, why bella's past life did what she did, what's really out there and why can't she go and see? I felt this was more of a tv series that clamped up scenes from each episode and just scraped it into a movie."
"Poor Things","ranwulfs","5 March 2024",110,"It took a while to really decide how I feel about this movie. I wanted to at least like it because I'm fond of Emma Stone. Her acting in this unusual role is certainly on another level, but I feel it's wasted on a terrible, terrible film. She didn't need to do this. She's talented, accomplished, popular, successful - why slum around in this brutal, nightmarish production? There's nothing good going on here. I felt sickened by half of the scenes, but staying and watching out of an admitted morbid fascination, and the disappointed hope it would somehow get better. I've seen a few of Yorgos Lanthimos's other films, and knew better than to expect something other than weird from him, but this was too much for me. Very sad that Emma Stone has decided to go in this direction in her career. I can't recommend this movie to anyone, and I'm going to do my best to forget I've seen it. I feel like I need a hot shower now to wash this horrible slime from me."
"Poor Things","parksiet","31 December 2023",410,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"Poor Things","Pjtaylor-96-138044","23 January 2024",510,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy)."
"Poor Things","Billybobble1","26 February 2024",310,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in."
"Poor Things","kjproulx","6 January 2024",1010,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever."
"Poor Things","imseeg","9 December 2023",510,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!"
"Poor Things","ThereelscoopwithKK","12 March 2024",110,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive."
"Poor Things","nicko252008","24 January 2024",210,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film."
"Poor Things","aciessi","24 December 2023",910,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
"Poor Things","pd-19490","20 January 2024",110,"My previous attempts at reviewing this were declined possibly due to how I expressed my strong opinions about the movie. I will try again with as much restraint as I can and try not to insert my opinion. So here it goes. The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she still has the mind of a child. These men know she has the mind of a child and yet continue anyway. I will let you interpret that how you will. I won't watch it again. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do."
"Poor Things","MovieCriticOnline","27 February 2024",110,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this."
"Poor Things","rgxdzrybr","1 February 2024",110,"I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either."
"Poor Things","nicolasroop","22 December 2023",910,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
"Poor Things","doppleganger19692","8 February 2024",510,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it."
"Poor Things","lbenot","28 December 2023",110,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
"Poor Things","allanmichael30","10 March 2024",110,"Why is this file so vile, its main story is the innocence of a child thrown in to a adult world. The adults raising her are sick and twisted and she runs away only to be abused by a sick vile man(played by mark ruffalo) who abuses the young child and a pedophilia. After she leaves him she gets abused by men in a brothel. This film should surely win best picture as holywood ""Me too"" have surely given actresses their rights back. If this is not sick enough the child that gets abused is the baby of a mother who killed her self, well just the brain. This film would get banned, if any rating system could. The acting of william defoe was very good, how ever the plot was just weird and even had husband of dead woman wanting to have relationship with own daughter."
"Poor Things","Victor_Santamaria","27 January 2024",110,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
"Poor Things","francogrex","29 February 2024",110,"I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie."
"Poor Things","lbowdls","9 March 2024",310,"Yes I'm echoing all those who hate this film. I think it's pornographic, exploitative and degrading.And I don't even agree that the acting is hood. Emma Stone should not even have been nominated for an Oscar let alone (I hope she doesn't win it, I'm writing this two days from the Oscars) if she does to me it would be like giving an Academy award to a porn actress. And Mark Rufullo who I usually love in most things and makes good choices. But what the hell was he thinking here? William Defoe is the only one who does a great job here, but again how could he want to be in it?Some say it's beautifully filmed - no it's not - the horrible, strange colors and staging is also very disconcerting.I gave it a couple up from 1 simply due to Defoe and occasional dialogue of insights. But those insights are certainly not feminist!"
"Poor Things","reelreviewsandrecommendations","22 January 2024",910,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"Poor Things","xxxxxdarkmoon","2 March 2024",110,"This one feels off for a reason.I will tell you what that reason is, in case you overlook the obvious. According to the ratings it did happen a few times.This one (I am avoiding the term ""movie"") contains adult-only material, but that is not the problem. The problem is: that the ""monster"" has the intellect of a child if I understand it correctly. Doesn't it?Do I need to say more?Actually, this is the point where nothing more has to be said. This is distasteful. It is not recommended for sane people.This is a failed attempt at a ""comedy-drama-romance"". A sane person would not even watch the movie til the end. And by no means rate it with more than 5 stars."
"Poor Things","moviedays1","10 January 2024",110,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity."
"Poor Things","RayCharles81","28 December 2023",110,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
"Poor Things","awagne-29536","28 December 2023",110,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."

And I thought ""No hard feelings"" was awful. But this- my oh my! Both have its merits-good actors but god awful writing! No heart what's so ever in this awful piece! I don't know what's more awkward and embarrassing~ being in that theater alone while watching it or being in a full theater and watching....but I was the one all alone so it might be more embarrassing. It's basically porn~ over and over and over. Within I'd say the first 7 min~you see male genitals, and I frowned~ she's acting 4. But the hints of snickers from myself turned into ""ok this is embarrassing"" that turned into ""oh god MORE sex?"" Which turned into ""MORE nudity?!!!""
This movie is~ EH HEMMMM if-
Tim Burton clashed with Lemony Snicket clashed with Victorian age clashing with futuristic realism clashing with Wednesday clashing with Barbie clashing with blind fashion designers, clashing with science clashing with porn and Frankenstein.....
All in all~
In the words of the great goddess herself I would like to quote~Katharine Hepburn~
""It's filth. I am disgusted with the movies. DISGUSTED! They are kidding themselves into saying it's an intellectual pastime. BUNK!""
Might be asking ""then why did you go see it-heck why did you stay until the very end?""
Because of the crazy hyped of reviews that were clearly written by teenagers it appears and I wasn't going to leave when I paid $14.....no wonder no one wants to see movies anymore in the theater~ what they're showing is garbage and no one wants to be THAT embarrassed into thinking they need to stay put because it's $14 spent.This was and had to have been made by either extremely high people~ or nymphomaniacs that don't want to actually tell a good story. You can tell a very great story without the use of alllllllll the sex! Seriously! Just look at Hollywood during the Hays Code Era!!!!It also felt they couldn't keep up with one plot, it threw in sooo many plots, ""finding out about life"" ""pleasure"" ""love"" ""emotions"" ""Victorian tragedy"". I felt like they tried to clump in 20 years of education down not only Bella's throat but mine as well. Learning as to why men torture women for pleasure, why bella's past life did what she did, what's really out there and why can't she go and see? I felt this was more of a tv series that clamped up scenes from each episode and just scraped it into a movie."
"Poor Things","ranwulfs","5 March 2024",110,"It took a while to really decide how I feel about this movie. I wanted to at least like it because I'm fond of Emma Stone. Her acting in this unusual role is certainly on another level, but I feel it's wasted on a terrible, terrible film. She didn't need to do this. She's talented, accomplished, popular, successful - why slum around in this brutal, nightmarish production? There's nothing good going on here. I felt sickened by half of the scenes, but staying and watching out of an admitted morbid fascination, and the disappointed hope it would somehow get better. I've seen a few of Yorgos Lanthimos's other films, and knew better than to expect something other than weird from him, but this was too much for me. Very sad that Emma Stone has decided to go in this direction in her career. I can't recommend this movie to anyone, and I'm going to do my best to forget I've seen it. I feel like I need a hot shower now to wash this horrible slime from me."

"Poor Things","Pjtaylor-96-138044","23 January 2024",510,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy)."
"Poor Things","Billybobble1","26 February 2024",310,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in."
"Poor Things","kjproulx","6 January 2024",1010,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever."
"Poor Things","imseeg","9 December 2023",510,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!"
"Poor Things","ThereelscoopwithKK","12 March 2024",110,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive."
"Poor Things","nicko252008","24 January 2024",210,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film."
"Poor Things","aciessi","24 December 2023",910,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
"Poor Things","pd-19490","20 January 2024",110,"My previous attempts at reviewing this were declined possibly due to how I expressed my strong opinions about the movie. I will try again with as much restraint as I can and try not to insert my opinion. So here it goes. The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she still has the mind of a child. These men know she has the mind of a child and yet continue anyway. I will let you interpret that how you will. I won't watch it again. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do."
"Poor Things","MovieCriticOnline","27 February 2024",110,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this."
"Poor Things","rgxdzrybr","1 February 2024",110,"I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either."
"Poor Things","nicolasroop","22 December 2023",910,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
"Poor Things","doppleganger19692","8 February 2024",510,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it."
"Poor Things","lbenot","28 December 2023",110,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
"Poor Things","allanmichael30","10 March 2024",110,"Why is this file so vile, its main story is the innocence of a child thrown in to a adult world. The adults raising her are sick and twisted and she runs away only to be abused by a sick vile man(played by mark ruffalo) who abuses the young child and a pedophilia. After she leaves him she gets abused by men in a brothel. This film should surely win best picture as holywood ""Me too"" have surely given actresses their rights back. If this is not sick enough the child that gets abused is the baby of a mother who killed her self, well just the brain. This film would get banned, if any rating system could. The acting of william defoe was very good, how ever the plot was just weird and even had husband of dead woman wanting to have relationship with own daughter."
"Poor Things","Victor_Santamaria","27 January 2024",110,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
"Poor Things","francogrex","29 February 2024",110,"I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie."
"Poor Things","lbowdls","9 March 2024",310,"Yes I'm echoing all those who hate this film. I think it's pornographic, exploitative and degrading.And I don't even agree that the acting is hood. Emma Stone should not even have been nominated for an Oscar let alone (I hope she doesn't win it, I'm writing this two days from the Oscars) if she does to me it would be like giving an Academy award to a porn actress. And Mark Rufullo who I usually love in most things and makes good choices. But what the hell was he thinking here? William Defoe is the only one who does a great job here, but again how could he want to be in it?Some say it's beautifully filmed - no it's not - the horrible, strange colors and staging is also very disconcerting.I gave it a couple up from 1 simply due to Defoe and occasional dialogue of insights. But those insights are certainly not feminist!"
"Poor Things","reelreviewsandrecommendations","22 January 2024",910,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"Poor Things","xxxxxdarkmoon","2 March 2024",110,"This one feels off for a reason.I will tell you what that reason is, in case you overlook the obvious. According to the ratings it did happen a few times.This one (I am avoiding the term ""movie"") contains adult-only material, but that is not the problem. The problem is: that the ""monster"" has the intellect of a child if I understand it correctly. Doesn't it?Do I need to say more?Actually, this is the point where nothing more has to be said. This is distasteful. It is not recommended for sane people.This is a failed attempt at a ""comedy-drama-romance"". A sane person would not even watch the movie til the end. And by no means rate it with more than 5 stars."
"Poor Things","moviedays1","10 January 2024",110,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity."
"Poor Things","RayCharles81","28 December 2023",110,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
"Poor Things","awagne-29536","28 December 2023",110,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Poor Things","acanacox","31 December 2023",110,"Did Emma Stone take career choice lessons from her best friend: Jennifer Lawrence and claim that movies that circulate around-sex- was the new ""it"" for movies?!!!! And I thought ""No hard feelings"" was awful. But this- my oh my! Both have its merits-good actors but god awful writing! No heart what's so ever in this awful piece! I don't know what's more awkward and embarrassing~ being in that theater alone while watching it or being in a full theater and watching....but I was the one all alone so it might be more embarrassing. It's basically porn~ over and over and over. Within I'd say the first 7 min~you see male genitals, and I frowned~ she's acting 4. But the hints of snickers from myself turned into ""ok this is embarrassing"" that turned into ""oh god MORE sex?"" Which turned into ""MORE nudity?!!!""
This movie is~ EH HEMMMM if-
Tim Burton clashed with Lemony Snicket clashed with Victorian age clashing with futuristic realism clashing with Wednesday clashing with Barbie clashing with blind fashion designers, clashing with science clashing with porn and Frankenstein.....
All in all~
In the words of the great goddess herself I would like to quote~Katharine Hepburn~
""It's filth. I am disgusted with the movies. DISGUSTED! They are kidding themselves into saying it's an intellectual pastime. BUNK!""
Might be asking ""then why did you go see it-heck why did you stay until the very end?""
Because of the crazy hyped of reviews that were clearly written by teenagers it appears and I wasn't going to leave when I paid $14.....no wonder no one wants to see movies anymore in the theater~ what they're showing is garbage and no one wants to be THAT embarrassed into thinking they need to stay put because it's $14 spent.This was and had to have been made by either extremely high people~ or nymphomaniacs that don't want to actually tell a good story. You can tell a very great story without the use of alllllllll the sex! Seriously! Just look at Hollywood during the Hays Code Era!!!!It also felt they couldn't keep up with one plot, it threw in sooo many plots, ""finding out about life"" ""pleasure"" ""love"" ""emotions"" ""Victorian tragedy"". I felt like they tried to clump in 20 years of education down not only Bella's throat but mine as well. Learning as to why men torture women for pleasure, why bella's past life did what she did, what's really out there and why can't she go and see? I felt this was more of a tv series that clamped up scenes from each episode and just scraped it into a movie."
"Poor Things","ranwulfs","5 March 2024",110,"It took a while to really decide how I feel about this movie. I wanted to at least like it because I'm fond of Emma Stone. Her acting in this unusual role is certainly on another level, but I feel it's wasted on a terrible, terrible film. She didn't need to do this. She's talented, accomplished, popular, successful - why slum around in this brutal, nightmarish production? There's nothing good going on here. I felt sickened by half of the scenes, but staying and watching out of an admitted morbid fascination, and the disappointed hope it would somehow get better. I've seen a few of Yorgos Lanthimos's other films, and knew better than to expect something other than weird from him, but this was too much for me. Very sad that Emma Stone has decided to go in this direction in her career. I can't recommend this movie to anyone, and I'm going to do my best to forget I've seen it. I feel like I need a hot shower now to wash this horrible slime from me."

"Poor Things","Pjtaylor-96-138044","23 January 2024",510,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy)."
"Poor Things","Billybobble1","26 February 2024",310,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in."
"Poor Things","kjproulx","6 January 2024",1010,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever."
"Poor Things","imseeg","9 December 2023",510,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!"
"Poor Things","ThereelscoopwithKK","12 March 2024",110,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive."
"Poor Things","nicko252008","24 January 2024",210,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film."
"Poor Things","aciessi","24 December 2023",910,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
"Poor Things","pd-19490","20 January 2024",110,"My previous attempts at reviewing this were declined possibly due to how I expressed my strong opinions about the movie. I will try again with as much restraint as I can and try not to insert my opinion. So here it goes. The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she still has the mind of a child. These men know she has the mind of a child and yet continue anyway. I will let you interpret that how you will. I won't watch it again. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do."
"Poor Things","MovieCriticOnline","27 February 2024",110,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this."
"Poor Things","rgxdzrybr","1 February 2024",110,"I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either."
"Poor Things","nicolasroop","22 December 2023",910,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
"Poor Things","doppleganger19692","8 February 2024",510,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it."
"Poor Things","lbenot","28 December 2023",110,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."

After she leaves him she gets abused by men in a brothel. This film should surely win best picture as holywood ""Me too"" have surely given actresses their rights back. If this is not sick enough the child that gets abused is the baby of a mother who killed her self, well just the brain. This film would get banned, if any rating system could.

"Poor Things","Victor_Santamaria","27 January 2024",110,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."

Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie."

Emma Stone should not even have been nominated for an Oscar let alone (I hope she doesn't win it, I'm writing this two days from the Oscars) if she does to me it would be like giving an Academy award to a porn actress. And Mark Rufullo who I usually love in most things and makes good choices. But what the hell was he thinking here? William Defoe is the only one who does a great job here, but again how could he want to be in it?Some say it's beautifully filmed - no it's not - the horrible, strange colors and staging is also very disconcerting.I gave it a couple up from 1 simply due to Defoe and occasional dialogue of insights. But those insights are certainly not feminist!"
"Poor Things","reelreviewsandrecommendations","22 January 2024",910,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"Poor Things","xxxxxdarkmoon","2 March 2024",110,"This one feels off for a reason.I will tell you what that reason is, in case you overlook the obvious. According to the ratings it did happen a few times.This one (I am avoiding the term ""movie"") contains adult-only material, but that is not the problem. The problem is: that the ""monster"" has the intellect of a child if I understand it correctly. Doesn't it?Do I need to say more?Actually, this is the point where nothing more has to be said. This is distasteful. It is not recommended for sane people.This is a failed attempt at a ""comedy-drama-romance"". A sane person would not even watch the movie til the end. And by no means rate it with more than 5 stars."
"Poor Things","moviedays1","10 January 2024",110,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity."
"Poor Things","RayCharles81","28 December 2023",110,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
"Poor Things","awagne-29536","28 December 2023",110,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Poor Things","acanacox","31 December 2023",110,"Did Emma Stone take career choice lessons from her best friend: Jennifer Lawrence and claim that movies that circulate around-sex- was the new ""it"" for movies?!!!! And I thought ""No hard feelings"" was awful. But this- my oh my! Both have its merits-good actors but god awful writing! No heart what's so ever in this awful piece! I don't know what's more awkward and embarrassing~ being in that theater alone while watching it or being in a full theater and watching....but I was the one all alone so it might be more embarrassing. It's basically porn~ over and over and over. Within I'd say the first 7 min~you see male genitals, and I frowned~ she's acting 4. But the hints of snickers from myself turned into ""ok this is embarrassing"" that turned into ""oh god MORE sex?"" Which turned into ""MORE nudity?!!!""
This movie is~ EH HEMMMM if-
Tim Burton clashed with Lemony Snicket clashed with Victorian age clashing with futuristic realism clashing with Wednesday clashing with Barbie clashing with blind fashion designers, clashing with science clashing with porn and Frankenstein.....
All in all~
In the words of the great goddess herself I would like to quote~Katharine Hepburn~
""It's filth. I am disgusted with the movies. DISGUSTED! They are kidding themselves into saying it's an intellectual pastime. BUNK!""
Might be asking ""then why did you go see it-heck why did you stay until the very end?""
Because of the crazy hyped of reviews that were clearly written by teenagers it appears and I wasn't going to leave when I paid $14.....no wonder no one wants to see movies anymore in the theater~ what they're showing is garbage and no one wants to be THAT embarrassed into thinking they need to stay put because it's $14 spent.This was and had to have been made by either extremely high people~ or nymphomaniacs that don't want to actually tell a good story. You can tell a very great story without the use of alllllllll the sex! Seriously! Just look at Hollywood during the Hays Code Era!!!!It also felt they couldn't keep up with one plot, it threw in sooo many plots, ""finding out about life"" ""pleasure"" ""love"" ""emotions"" ""Victorian tragedy"". I felt like they tried to clump in 20 years of education down not only Bella's throat but mine as well. Learning as to why men torture women for pleasure, why bella's past life did what she did, what's really out there and why can't she go and see? I felt this was more of a tv series that clamped up scenes from each episode and just scraped it into a movie."
"Poor Things","ranwulfs","5 March 2024",110,"It took a while to really decide how I feel about this movie. I wanted to at least like it because I'm fond of Emma Stone. Her acting in this unusual role is certainly on another level, but I feel it's wasted on a terrible, terrible film. She didn't need to do this. She's talented, accomplished, popular, successful - why slum around in this brutal, nightmarish production? There's nothing good going on here. I felt sickened by half of the scenes, but staying and watching out of an admitted morbid fascination, and the disappointed hope it would somehow get better. I've seen a few of Yorgos Lanthimos's other films, and knew better than to expect something other than weird from him, but this was too much for me. Very sad that Emma Stone has decided to go in this direction in her career. I can't recommend this movie to anyone, and I'm going to do my best to forget I've seen it. I feel like I need a hot shower now to wash this horrible slime from me."
"Poor Things","parksiet","31 December 2023",410,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"Poor Things","Pjtaylor-96-138044","23 January 2024",510,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy)."
"Poor Things","Billybobble1","26 February 2024",310,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in."
"Poor Things","kjproulx","6 January 2024",1010,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever."
"Poor Things","imseeg","9 December 2023",510,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!"
"Poor Things","ThereelscoopwithKK","12 March 2024",110,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive."
"Poor Things","nicko252008","24 January 2024",210,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film."
"Poor Things","aciessi","24 December 2023",910,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
"Poor Things","pd-19490","20 January 2024",110,"My previous attempts at reviewing this were declined possibly due to how I expressed my strong opinions about the movie. I will try again with as much restraint as I can and try not to insert my opinion. So here it goes. The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she still has the mind of a child. These men know she has the mind of a child and yet continue anyway. I will let you interpret that how you will. I won't watch it again. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do."
"Poor Things","MovieCriticOnline","27 February 2024",110,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this."
"Poor Things","rgxdzrybr","1 February 2024",110,"I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either."
"Poor Things","nicolasroop","22 December 2023",910,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
"Poor Things","doppleganger19692","8 February 2024",510,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it."
"Poor Things","lbenot","28 December 2023",110,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
"Poor Things","allanmichael30","10 March 2024",110,"Why is this file so vile, its main story is the innocence of a child thrown in to a adult world. The adults raising her are sick and twisted and she runs away only to be abused by a sick vile man(played by mark ruffalo) who abuses the young child and a pedophilia. After she leaves him she gets abused by men in a brothel. This film should surely win best picture as holywood ""Me too"" have surely given actresses their rights back. If this is not sick enough the child that gets abused is the baby of a mother who killed her self, well just the brain. This film would get banned, if any rating system could.

"Poor Things","Victor_Santamaria","27 January 2024",110,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."

Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie."
"Poor Things","lbowdls","9 March 2024",310,"Yes I'm echoing all those who hate this film. I think it's pornographic, exploitative and degrading.And I don't even agree that the acting is hood. Emma Stone should not even have been nominated for an Oscar let alone (I hope she doesn't win it, I'm writing this two days from the Oscars) if she does to me it would be like giving an Academy award to a porn actress. And Mark Rufullo who I usually love in most things and makes good choices. But what the hell was he thinking here? William Defoe is the only one who does a great job here, but again how could he want to be in it?Some say it's beautifully filmed - no it's not - the horrible, strange colors and staging is also very disconcerting.I gave it a couple up from 1 simply due to Defoe and occasional dialogue of insights. But those insights are certainly not feminist!"
"Poor Things","reelreviewsandrecommendations","22 January 2024",910,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"Poor Things","xxxxxdarkmoon","2 March 2024",110,"This one feels off for a reason.I will tell you what that reason is, in case you overlook the obvious. According to the ratings it did happen a few times.This one (I am avoiding the term ""movie"") contains adult-only material, but that is not the problem. The problem is: that the ""monster"" has the intellect of a child if I understand it correctly. Doesn't it?Do I need to say more?Actually, this is the point where nothing more has to be said. This is distasteful. It is not recommended for sane people.This is a failed attempt at a ""comedy-drama-romance"". A sane person would not even watch the movie til the end. And by no means rate it with more than 5 stars."
"Poor Things","moviedays1","10 January 2024",110,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity."
"Poor Things","RayCharles81","28 December 2023",110,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
"Poor Things","awagne-29536","28 December 2023",110,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Poor Things","acanacox","31 December 2023",110,"Did Emma Stone take career choice lessons from her best friend: Jennifer Lawrence and claim that movies that circulate around-sex- was the new ""it"" for movies?!!!! And I thought ""No hard feelings"" was awful. But this- my oh my! Both have its merits-good actors but god awful writing! No heart what's so ever in this awful piece! I don't know what's more awkward and embarrassing~ being in that theater alone while watching it or being in a full theater and watching....but I was the one all alone so it might be more embarrassing. It's basically porn~ over and over and over. Within I'd say the first 7 min~you see male genitals, and I frowned~ she's acting 4. But the hints of snickers from myself turned into ""ok this is embarrassing"" that turned into ""oh god MORE sex?"" Which turned into ""MORE nudity?!!!""
This movie is~ EH HEMMMM if-
Tim Burton clashed with Lemony Snicket clashed with Victorian age clashing with futuristic realism clashing with Wednesday clashing with Barbie clashing with blind fashion designers, clashing with science clashing with porn and Frankenstein.....
All in all~
In the words of the great goddess herself I would like to quote~Katharine Hepburn~
""It's filth. I am disgusted with the movies. DISGUSTED! They are kidding themselves into saying it's an intellectual pastime. BUNK!""
Might be asking ""then why did you go see it-heck why did you stay until the very end?""
Because of the crazy hyped of reviews that were clearly written by teenagers it appears and I wasn't going to leave when I paid $14.....no wonder no one wants to see movies anymore in the theater~ what they're showing is garbage and no one wants to be THAT embarrassed into thinking they need to stay put because it's $14 spent.This was and had to have been made by either extremely high people~ or nymphomaniacs that don't want to actually tell a good story. You can tell a very great story without the use of alllllllll the sex! Seriously! Just look at Hollywood during the Hays Code Era!!!!It also felt they couldn't keep up with one plot, it threw in sooo many plots, ""finding out about life"" ""pleasure"" ""love"" ""emotions"" ""Victorian tragedy"". I felt like they tried to clump in 20 years of education down not only Bella's throat but mine as well. Learning as to why men torture women for pleasure, why bella's past life did what she did, what's really out there and why can't she go and see? I felt this was more of a tv series that clamped up scenes from each episode and just scraped it into a movie."
"Poor Things","ranwulfs","5 March 2024",110,"It took a while to really decide how I feel about this movie. I wanted to at least like it because I'm fond of Emma Stone. Her acting in this unusual role is certainly on another level, but I feel it's wasted on a terrible, terrible film. She didn't need to do this. She's talented, accomplished, popular, successful - why slum around in this brutal, nightmarish production? There's nothing good going on here. I felt sickened by half of the scenes, but staying and watching out of an admitted morbid fascination, and the disappointed hope it would somehow get better. I've seen a few of Yorgos Lanthimos's other films, and knew better than to expect something other than weird from him, but this was too much for me. Very sad that Emma Stone has decided to go in this direction in her career. I can't recommend this movie to anyone, and I'm going to do my best to forget I've seen it. I feel like I need a hot shower now to wash this horrible slime from me."

"Poor Things","Pjtaylor-96-138044","23 January 2024",510,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy)."
"Poor Things","Billybobble1","26 February 2024",310,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in."
"Poor Things","kjproulx","6 January 2024",1010,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever."
"Poor Things","imseeg","9 December 2023",510,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!"
"Poor Things","ThereelscoopwithKK","12 March 2024",110,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive."
"Poor Things","nicko252008","24 January 2024",210,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film."
"Poor Things","aciessi","24 December 2023",910,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
"Poor Things","pd-19490","20 January 2024",110,"My previous attempts at reviewing this were declined possibly due to how I expressed my strong opinions about the movie. I will try again with as much restraint as I can and try not to insert my opinion. So here it goes. The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she still has the mind of a child. These men know she has the mind of a child and yet continue anyway. I will let you interpret that how you will. I won't watch it again. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do."
"Poor Things","MovieCriticOnline","27 February 2024",110,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this."
"Poor Things","rgxdzrybr","1 February 2024",110,"I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either."
"Poor Things","nicolasroop","22 December 2023",910,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
"Poor Things","doppleganger19692","8 February 2024",510,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it."
"Poor Things","lbenot","28 December 2023",110,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
"Poor Things","allanmichael30","10 March 2024",110,"Why is this file so vile, its main story is the innocence of a child thrown in to a adult world. The adults raising her are sick and twisted and she runs away only to be abused by a sick vile man(played by mark ruffalo) who abuses the young child and a pedophilia. After she leaves him she gets abused by men in a brothel. This film should surely win best picture as holywood ""Me too"" have surely given actresses their rights back. If this is not sick enough the child that gets abused is the baby of a mother who killed her self, well just the brain. This film would get banned, if any rating system could. The acting of william defoe was very good, how ever the plot was just weird and even had husband of dead woman wanting to have relationship with own daughter."
"Poor Things","Victor_Santamaria","27 January 2024",110,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
"Poor Things","francogrex","29 February 2024",110,"I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie."
"Poor Things","lbowdls","9 March 2024",310,"Yes I'm echoing all those who hate this film. I think it's pornographic, exploitative and degrading.And I don't even agree that the acting is hood. Emma Stone should not even have been nominated for an Oscar let alone (I hope she doesn't win it, I'm writing this two days from the Oscars) if she does to me it would be like giving an Academy award to a porn actress. And Mark Rufullo who I usually love in most things and makes good choices. But what the hell was he thinking here? William Defoe is the only one who does a great job here, but again how could he want to be in it?Some say it's beautifully filmed - no it's not - the horrible, strange colors and staging is also very disconcerting.I gave it a couple up from 1 simply due to Defoe and occasional dialogue of insights. But those insights are certainly not feminist!"
"Poor Things","reelreviewsandrecommendations","22 January 2024",910,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"Poor Things","xxxxxdarkmoon","2 March 2024",110,"This one feels off for a reason.I will tell you what that reason is, in case you overlook the obvious. According to the ratings it did happen a few times.This one (I am avoiding the term ""movie"") contains adult-only material, but that is not the problem. The problem is: that the ""monster"" has the intellect of a child if I understand it correctly. Doesn't it?Do I need to say more?Actually, this is the point where nothing more has to be said. This is distasteful. It is not recommended for sane people.This is a failed attempt at a ""comedy-drama-romance"". A sane person would not even watch the movie til the end. And by no means rate it with more than 5 stars."
"Poor Things","moviedays1","10 January 2024",110,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity."
"Poor Things","RayCharles81","28 December 2023",110,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
"Poor Things","awagne-29536","28 December 2023",110,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Poor Things","acanacox","31 December 2023",110,"Did Emma Stone take career choice lessons from her best friend: Jennifer Lawrence and claim that movies that circulate around-sex- was the new ""it"" for movies?!!!! And I thought ""No hard feelings"" was awful. But this- my oh my! Both have its merits-good actors but god awful writing! No heart what's so ever in this awful piece! I don't know what's more awkward and embarrassing~ being in that theater alone while watching it or being in a full theater and watching....but I was the one all alone so it might be more embarrassing. It's basically porn~ over and over and over. Within I'd say the first 7 min~you see male genitals, and I frowned~ she's acting 4. But the hints of snickers from myself turned into ""ok this is embarrassing"" that turned into ""oh god MORE sex?"" Which turned into ""MORE nudity?!!!""
This movie is~ EH HEMMMM if-
Tim Burton clashed with Lemony Snicket clashed with Victorian age clashing with futuristic realism clashing with Wednesday clashing with Barbie clashing with blind fashion designers, clashing with science clashing with porn and Frankenstein.....
All in all~
In the words of the great goddess herself I would like to quote~Katharine Hepburn~
""It's filth. I am disgusted with the movies. DISGUSTED! They are kidding themselves into saying it's an intellectual pastime. BUNK!""
Might be asking ""then why did you go see it-heck why did you stay until the very end?""
Because of the crazy hyped of reviews that were clearly written by teenagers it appears and I wasn't going to leave when I paid $14.....no wonder no one wants to see movies anymore in the theater~ what they're showing is garbage and no one wants to be THAT embarrassed into thinking they need to stay put because it's $14 spent.This was and had to have been made by either extremely high people~ or nymphomaniacs that don't want to actually tell a good story. You can tell a very great story without the use of alllllllll the sex! Seriously! Just look at Hollywood during the Hays Code Era!!!!It also felt they couldn't keep up with one plot, it threw in sooo many plots, ""finding out about life"" ""pleasure"" ""love"" ""emotions"" ""Victorian tragedy"". I felt like they tried to clump in 20 years of education down not only Bella's throat but mine as well. Learning as to why men torture women for pleasure, why bella's past life did what she did, what's really out there and why can't she go and see? I felt this was more of a tv series that clamped up scenes from each episode and just scraped it into a movie."
"Poor Things","ranwulfs","5 March 2024",110,"It took a while to really decide how I feel about this movie. I wanted to at least like it because I'm fond of Emma Stone. Her acting in this unusual role is certainly on another level, but I feel it's wasted on a terrible, terrible film. She didn't need to do this. She's talented, accomplished, popular, successful - why slum around in this brutal, nightmarish production? There's nothing good going on here. I felt sickened by half of the scenes, but staying and watching out of an admitted morbid fascination, and the disappointed hope it would somehow get better. I've seen a few of Yorgos Lanthimos's other films, and knew better than to expect something other than weird from him, but this was too much for me. Very sad that Emma Stone has decided to go in this direction in her career. I can't recommend this movie to anyone, and I'm going to do my best to forget I've seen it.

"Poor Things","Pjtaylor-96-138044","23 January 2024",510,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy)."
"Poor Things","Billybobble1","26 February 2024",310,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in."
"Poor Things","kjproulx","6 January 2024",1010,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever."
"Poor Things","imseeg","9 December 2023",510,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!"
"Poor Things","ThereelscoopwithKK","12 March 2024",110,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive."
"Poor Things","nicko252008","24 January 2024",210,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film."
"Poor Things","aciessi","24 December 2023",910,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
"Poor Things","pd-19490","20 January 2024",110,"My previous attempts at reviewing this were declined possibly due to how I expressed my strong opinions about the movie. I will try again with as much restraint as I can and try not to insert my opinion. So here it goes. The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she still has the mind of a child. These men know she has the mind of a child and yet continue anyway. I will let you interpret that how you will. I won't watch it again. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do."
"Poor Things","MovieCriticOnline","27 February 2024",110,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this."
"Poor Things","rgxdzrybr","1 February 2024",110,"I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either."
"Poor Things","nicolasroop","22 December 2023",910,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
"Poor Things","doppleganger19692","8 February 2024",510,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it."
"Poor Things","lbenot","28 December 2023",110,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
"Poor Things","allanmichael30","10 March 2024",110,"Why is this file so vile, its main story is the innocence of a child thrown in to a adult world. The adults raising her are sick and twisted and she runs away only to be abused by a sick vile man(played by mark ruffalo) who abuses the young child and a pedophilia. After she leaves him she gets abused by men in a brothel. This film should surely win best picture as holywood ""Me too"" have surely given actresses their rights back. If this is not sick enough the child that gets abused is the baby of a mother who killed her self, well just the brain. This film would get banned, if any rating system could. The acting of william defoe was very good, how ever the plot was just weird and even had husband of dead woman wanting to have relationship with own daughter."
"Poor Things","Victor_Santamaria","27 January 2024",110,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
"Poor Things","francogrex","29 February 2024",110,"I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie."
"Poor Things","lbowdls","9 March 2024",310,"Yes I'm echoing all those who hate this film. I think it's pornographic, exploitative and degrading.And I don't even agree that the acting is hood. Emma Stone should not even have been nominated for an Oscar let alone (I hope she doesn't win it, I'm writing this two days from the Oscars) if she does to me it would be like giving an Academy award to a porn actress. And Mark Rufullo who I usually love in most things and makes good choices. But what the hell was he thinking here? William Defoe is the only one who does a great job here, but again how could he want to be in it?Some say it's beautifully filmed - no it's not - the horrible, strange colors and staging is also very disconcerting.I gave it a couple up from 1 simply due to Defoe and occasional dialogue of insights. But those insights are certainly not feminist!"
"Poor Things","reelreviewsandrecommendations","22 January 2024",910,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"Poor Things","xxxxxdarkmoon","2 March 2024",110,"This one feels off for a reason.I will tell you what that reason is, in case you overlook the obvious. According to the ratings it did happen a few times.This one (I am avoiding the term ""movie"") contains adult-only material, but that is not the problem. The problem is: that the ""monster"" has the intellect of a child if I understand it correctly. Doesn't it?Do I need to say more?Actually, this is the point where nothing more has to be said. This is distasteful. It is not recommended for sane people.This is a failed attempt at a ""comedy-drama-romance"". A sane person would not even watch the movie til the end.

"Poor Things","moviedays1","10 January 2024",110,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity."
"Poor Things","RayCharles81","28 December 2023",110,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
"Poor Things","awagne-29536","28 December 2023",110,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Poor Things","acanacox","31 December 2023",110,"Did Emma Stone take career choice lessons from her best friend: Jennifer Lawrence and claim that movies that circulate around-sex- was the new ""it"" for movies?!!!! And I thought ""No hard feelings"" was awful. But this- my oh my! Both have its merits-good actors but god awful writing! No heart what's so ever in this awful piece! I don't know what's more awkward and embarrassing~ being in that theater alone while watching it or being in a full theater and watching....but I was the one all alone so it might be more embarrassing. It's basically porn~ over and over and over. Within I'd say the first 7 min~you see male genitals, and I frowned~ she's acting 4. But the hints of snickers from myself turned into ""ok this is embarrassing"" that turned into ""oh god MORE sex?"" Which turned into ""MORE nudity?!!!""
This movie is~ EH HEMMMM if-
Tim Burton clashed with Lemony Snicket clashed with Victorian age clashing with futuristic realism clashing with Wednesday clashing with Barbie clashing with blind fashion designers, clashing with science clashing with porn and Frankenstein.....
All in all~
In the words of the great goddess herself I would like to quote~Katharine Hepburn~
""It's filth. I am disgusted with the movies. DISGUSTED! They are kidding themselves into saying it's an intellectual pastime. BUNK!""
Might be asking ""then why did you go see it-heck why did you stay until the very end?""
Because of the crazy hyped of reviews that were clearly written by teenagers it appears and I wasn't going to leave when I paid $14.....no wonder no one wants to see movies anymore in the theater~ what they're showing is garbage and no one wants to be THAT embarrassed into thinking they need to stay put because it's $14 spent.This was and had to have been made by either extremely high people~ or nymphomaniacs that don't want to actually tell a good story. You can tell a very great story without the use of alllllllll the sex! Seriously! Just look at Hollywood during the Hays Code Era!!!!It also felt they couldn't keep up with one plot, it threw in sooo many plots, ""finding out about life"" ""pleasure"" ""love"" ""emotions"" ""Victorian tragedy"". I felt like they tried to clump in 20 years of education down not only Bella's throat but mine as well. Learning as to why men torture women for pleasure, why bella's past life did what she did, what's really out there and why can't she go and see? I felt this was more of a tv series that clamped up scenes from each episode and just scraped it into a movie."
"Poor Things","ranwulfs","5 March 2024",110,"It took a while to really decide how I feel about this movie. I wanted to at least like it because I'm fond of Emma Stone. Her acting in this unusual role is certainly on another level, but I feel it's wasted on a terrible, terrible film. She didn't need to do this. She's talented, accomplished, popular, successful - why slum around in this brutal, nightmarish production? There's nothing good going on here. I felt sickened by half of the scenes, but staying and watching out of an admitted morbid fascination, and the disappointed hope it would somehow get better. I've seen a few of Yorgos Lanthimos's other films, and knew better than to expect something other than weird from him, but this was too much for me. Very sad that Emma Stone has decided to go in this direction in her career. I can't recommend this movie to anyone, and I'm going to do my best to forget I've seen it. I feel like I need a hot shower now to wash this horrible slime from me."

I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here!

"Poor Things","Pjtaylor-96-138044","23 January 2024",510,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy)."
"Poor Things","Billybobble1","26 February 2024",310,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in."
"Poor Things","kjproulx","6 January 2024",1010,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever."
"Poor Things","imseeg","9 December 2023",510,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!"
"Poor Things","ThereelscoopwithKK","12 March 2024",110,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive."
"Poor Things","nicko252008","24 January 2024",210,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film."
"Poor Things","aciessi","24 December 2023",910,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
"Poor Things","pd-19490","20 January 2024",110,"My previous attempts at reviewing this were declined possibly due to how I expressed my strong opinions about the movie. I will try again with as much restraint as I can and try not to insert my opinion. So here it goes. The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she still has the mind of a child. These men know she has the mind of a child and yet continue anyway. I will let you interpret that how you will. I won't watch it again. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do."
"Poor Things","MovieCriticOnline","27 February 2024",110,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this."
"Poor Things","rgxdzrybr","1 February 2024",110,"I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either."
"Poor Things","nicolasroop","22 December 2023",910,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
"Poor Things","doppleganger19692","8 February 2024",510,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it."

If this is not sick enough the child that gets abused is the baby of a mother who killed her self, well just the brain. This film would get banned, if any rating system could. The acting of william defoe was very good, how ever the plot was just weird and even had husband of dead woman wanting to have relationship with own daughter."
"Poor Things","Victor_Santamaria","27 January 2024",110,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
"Poor Things","francogrex","29 February 2024",110,"I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie."
"Poor Things","lbowdls","9 March 2024",310,"Yes I'm echoing all those who hate this film. I think it's pornographic, exploitative and degrading.And I don't even agree that the acting is hood. Emma Stone should not even have been nominated for an Oscar let alone (I hope she doesn't win it, I'm writing this two days from the Oscars) if she does to me it would be like giving an Academy award to a porn actress. And Mark Rufullo who I usually love in most things and makes good choices. But what the hell was he thinking here? William Defoe is the only one who does a great job here, but again how could he want to be in it?Some say it's beautifully filmed - no it's not - the horrible, strange colors and staging is also very disconcerting.I gave it a couple up from 1 simply due to Defoe and occasional dialogue of insights. But those insights are certainly not feminist!"
"Poor Things","reelreviewsandrecommendations","22 January 2024",910,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"Poor Things","xxxxxdarkmoon","2 March 2024",110,"This one feels off for a reason.I will tell you what that reason is, in case you overlook the obvious. According to the ratings it did happen a few times.This one (I am avoiding the term ""movie"") contains adult-only material, but that is not the problem. The problem is: that the ""monster"" has the intellect of a child if I understand it correctly. Doesn't it?Do I need to say more?Actually, this is the point where nothing more has to be said. This is distasteful. It is not recommended for sane people.This is a failed attempt at a ""comedy-drama-romance"". A sane person would not even watch the movie til the end. And by no means rate it with more than 5 stars."
"Poor Things","moviedays1","10 January 2024",110,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity."
"Poor Things","RayCharles81","28 December 2023",110,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
"Poor Things","awagne-29536","28 December 2023",110,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Poor Things","acanacox","31 December 2023",110,"Did Emma Stone take career choice lessons from her best friend: Jennifer Lawrence and claim that movies that circulate around-sex- was the new ""it"" for movies?!!!! And I thought ""No hard feelings"" was awful. But this- my oh my! Both have its merits-good actors but god awful writing! No heart what's so ever in this awful piece! I don't know what's more awkward and embarrassing~ being in that theater alone while watching it or being in a full theater and watching....but I was the one all alone so it might be more embarrassing. It's basically porn~ over and over and over. Within I'd say the first 7 min~you see male genitals, and I frowned~ she's acting 4. But the hints of snickers from myself turned into ""ok this is embarrassing"" that turned into ""oh god MORE sex?"" Which turned into ""MORE nudity?!!!""
This movie is~ EH HEMMMM if-
Tim Burton clashed with Lemony Snicket clashed with Victorian age clashing with futuristic realism clashing with Wednesday clashing with Barbie clashing with blind fashion designers, clashing with science clashing with porn and Frankenstein.....
All in all~
In the words of the great goddess herself I would like to quote~Katharine Hepburn~
""It's filth. I am disgusted with the movies. DISGUSTED! They are kidding themselves into saying it's an intellectual pastime. BUNK!""
Might be asking ""then why did you go see it-heck why did you stay until the very end?""
Because of the crazy hyped of reviews that were clearly written by teenagers it appears and I wasn't going to leave when I paid $14.....no wonder no one wants to see movies anymore in the theater~ what they're showing is garbage and no one wants to be THAT embarrassed into thinking they need to stay put because it's $14 spent.This was and had to have been made by either extremely high people~ or nymphomaniacs that don't want to actually tell a good story. You can tell a very great story without the use of alllllllll the sex! Seriously! Just look at Hollywood during the Hays Code Era!!!!It also felt they couldn't keep up with one plot, it threw in sooo many plots, ""finding out about life"" ""pleasure"" ""love"" ""emotions"" ""Victorian tragedy"". I felt like they tried to clump in 20 years of education down not only Bella's throat but mine as well. Learning as to why men torture women for pleasure, why bella's past life did what she did, what's really out there and why can't she go and see? I felt this was more of a tv series that clamped up scenes from each episode and just scraped it into a movie."
"Poor Things","ranwulfs","5 March 2024",110,"It took a while to really decide how I feel about this movie. I wanted to at least like it because I'm fond of Emma Stone. Her acting in this unusual role is certainly on another level, but I feel it's wasted on a terrible, terrible film. She didn't need to do this. She's talented, accomplished, popular, successful - why slum around in this brutal, nightmarish production? There's nothing good going on here. I felt sickened by half of the scenes, but staying and watching out of an admitted morbid fascination, and the disappointed hope it would somehow get better. I've seen a few of Yorgos Lanthimos's other films, and knew better than to expect something other than weird from him, but this was too much for me. Very sad that Emma Stone has decided to go in this direction in her career. I can't recommend this movie to anyone, and I'm going to do my best to forget I've seen it. I feel like I need a hot shower now to wash this horrible slime from me."

I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"Poor Things","Pjtaylor-96-138044","23 January 2024",510,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy)."
"Poor Things","Billybobble1","26 February 2024",310,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in."
"Poor Things","kjproulx","6 January 2024",1010,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever."
"Poor Things","imseeg","9 December 2023",510,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!"
"Poor Things","ThereelscoopwithKK","12 March 2024",110,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive."
"Poor Things","nicko252008","24 January 2024",210,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film."
"Poor Things","aciessi","24 December 2023",910,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
"Poor Things","pd-19490","20 January 2024",110,"My previous attempts at reviewing this were declined possibly due to how I expressed my strong opinions about the movie. I will try again with as much restraint as I can and try not to insert my opinion. So here it goes. The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she still has the mind of a child. These men know she has the mind of a child and yet continue anyway. I will let you interpret that how you will. I won't watch it again. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do."
"Poor Things","MovieCriticOnline","27 February 2024",110,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this."
"Poor Things","rgxdzrybr","1 February 2024",110,"I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either."
"Poor Things","nicolasroop","22 December 2023",910,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
"Poor Things","doppleganger19692","8 February 2024",510,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it."
"Poor Things","lbenot","28 December 2023",110,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
"Poor Things","allanmichael30","10 March 2024",110,"Why is this file so vile, its main story is the innocence of a child thrown in to a adult world. The adults raising her are sick and twisted and she runs away only to be abused by a sick vile man(played by mark ruffalo) who abuses the young child and a pedophilia. After she leaves him she gets abused by men in a brothel. This film should surely win best picture as holywood ""Me too"" have surely given actresses their rights back. If this is not sick enough the child that gets abused is the baby of a mother who killed her self, well just the brain. This film would get banned, if any rating system could. The acting of william defoe was very good, how ever the plot was just weird and even had husband of dead woman wanting to have relationship with own daughter."
"Poor Things","Victor_Santamaria","27 January 2024",110,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
"Poor Things","francogrex","29 February 2024",110,"I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie."
"Poor Things","lbowdls","9 March 2024",310,"Yes I'm echoing all those who hate this film. I think it's pornographic, exploitative and degrading.And I don't even agree that the acting is hood. Emma Stone should not even have been nominated for an Oscar let alone (I hope she doesn't win it, I'm writing this two days from the Oscars) if she does to me it would be like giving an Academy award to a porn actress. And Mark Rufullo who I usually love in most things and makes good choices. But what the hell was he thinking here? William Defoe is the only one who does a great job here, but again how could he want to be in it?Some say it's beautifully filmed - no it's not - the horrible, strange colors and staging is also very disconcerting.I gave it a couple up from 1 simply due to Defoe and occasional dialogue of insights. But those insights are certainly not feminist!"
"Poor Things","reelreviewsandrecommendations","22 January 2024",910,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"Poor Things","xxxxxdarkmoon","2 March 2024",110,"This one feels off for a reason.I will tell you what that reason is, in case you overlook the obvious. According to the ratings it did happen a few times.This one (I am avoiding the term ""movie"") contains adult-only material, but that is not the problem. The problem is: that the ""monster"" has the intellect of a child if I understand it correctly. Doesn't it?Do I need to say more?Actually, this is the point where nothing more has to be said. This is distasteful. It is not recommended for sane people.This is a failed attempt at a ""comedy-drama-romance"". A sane person would not even watch the movie til the end. And by no means rate it with more than 5 stars."
"Poor Things","moviedays1","10 January 2024",110,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity."
"Poor Things","RayCharles81","28 December 2023",110,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
"Poor Things","awagne-29536","28 December 2023",110,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."

And I thought ""No hard feelings"" was awful. But this- my oh my! Both have its merits-good actors but god awful writing! No heart what's so ever in this awful piece! I don't know what's more awkward and embarrassing~ being in that theater alone while watching it or being in a full theater and watching....but I was the one all alone so it might be more embarrassing. It's basically porn~ over and over and over. Within I'd say the first 7 min~you see male genitals, and I frowned~ she's acting 4. But the hints of snickers from myself turned into ""ok this is embarrassing"" that turned into ""oh god MORE sex?"" Which turned into ""MORE nudity?!!!""
This movie is~ EH HEMMMM if-
Tim Burton clashed with Lemony Snicket clashed with Victorian age clashing with futuristic realism clashing with Wednesday clashing with Barbie clashing with blind fashion designers, clashing with science clashing with porn and Frankenstein.....
All in all~
In the words of the great goddess herself I would like to quote~Katharine Hepburn~
""It's filth. I am disgusted with the movies. DISGUSTED! They are kidding themselves into saying it's an intellectual pastime. BUNK!""
Might be asking ""then why did you go see it-heck why did you stay until the very end?""
Because of the crazy hyped of reviews that were clearly written by teenagers it appears and I wasn't going to leave when I paid $14.....no wonder no one wants to see movies anymore in the theater~ what they're showing is garbage and no one wants to be THAT embarrassed into thinking they need to stay put because it's $14 spent.This was and had to have been made by either extremely high people~ or nymphomaniacs that don't want to actually tell a good story. You can tell a very great story without the use of alllllllll the sex! Seriously! Just look at Hollywood during the Hays Code Era!!!!It also felt they couldn't keep up with one plot, it threw in sooo many plots, ""finding out about life"" ""pleasure"" ""love"" ""emotions"" ""Victorian tragedy"". I felt like they tried to clump in 20 years of education down not only Bella's throat but mine as well. Learning as to why men torture women for pleasure, why bella's past life did what she did, what's really out there and why can't she go and see? I felt this was more of a tv series that clamped up scenes from each episode and just scraped it into a movie."
"Poor Things","ranwulfs","5 March 2024",110,"It took a while to really decide how I feel about this movie. I wanted to at least like it because I'm fond of Emma Stone. Her acting in this unusual role is certainly on another level, but I feel it's wasted on a terrible, terrible film. She didn't need to do this. She's talented, accomplished, popular, successful - why slum around in this brutal, nightmarish production? There's nothing good going on here. I felt sickened by half of the scenes, but staying and watching out of an admitted morbid fascination, and the disappointed hope it would somehow get better. I've seen a few of Yorgos Lanthimos's other films, and knew better than to expect something other than weird from him, but this was too much for me. Very sad that Emma Stone has decided to go in this direction in her career. I can't recommend this movie to anyone, and I'm going to do my best to forget I've seen it.

"Poor Things","Pjtaylor-96-138044","23 January 2024",510,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy)."
"Poor Things","Billybobble1","26 February 2024",310,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in."
"Poor Things","kjproulx","6 January 2024",1010,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever."
"Poor Things","imseeg","9 December 2023",510,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!"
"Poor Things","ThereelscoopwithKK","12 March 2024",110,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive."
"Poor Things","nicko252008","24 January 2024",210,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film."
"Poor Things","aciessi","24 December 2023",910,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
"Poor Things","pd-19490","20 January 2024",110,"My previous attempts at reviewing this were declined possibly due to how I expressed my strong opinions about the movie. I will try again with as much restraint as I can and try not to insert my opinion. So here it goes. The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she still has the mind of a child. These men know she has the mind of a child and yet continue anyway. I will let you interpret that how you will. I won't watch it again. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do."
"Poor Things","MovieCriticOnline","27 February 2024",110,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this."
"Poor Things","rgxdzrybr","1 February 2024",110,"I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either."
"Poor Things","nicolasroop","22 December 2023",910,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
"Poor Things","doppleganger19692","8 February 2024",510,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it."
"Poor Things","lbenot","28 December 2023",110,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
"Poor Things","allanmichael30","10 March 2024",110,"Why is this file so vile, its main story is the innocence of a child thrown in to a adult world. The adults raising her are sick and twisted and she runs away only to be abused by a sick vile man(played by mark ruffalo) who abuses the young child and a pedophilia. After she leaves him she gets abused by men in a brothel. This film should surely win best picture as holywood ""Me too"" have surely given actresses their rights back. If this is not sick enough the child that gets abused is the baby of a mother who killed her self, well just the brain. This film would get banned, if any rating system could. The acting of william defoe was very good, how ever the plot was just weird and even had husband of dead woman wanting to have relationship with own daughter."
"Poor Things","Victor_Santamaria","27 January 2024",110,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
"Poor Things","francogrex","29 February 2024",110,"I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie."
"Poor Things","lbowdls","9 March 2024",310,"Yes I'm echoing all those who hate this film. I think it's pornographic, exploitative and degrading.And I don't even agree that the acting is hood. Emma Stone should not even have been nominated for an Oscar let alone (I hope she doesn't win it, I'm writing this two days from the Oscars) if she does to me it would be like giving an Academy award to a porn actress. And Mark Rufullo who I usually love in most things and makes good choices. But what the hell was he thinking here? William Defoe is the only one who does a great job here, but again how could he want to be in it?Some say it's beautifully filmed - no it's not - the horrible, strange colors and staging is also very disconcerting.I gave it a couple up from 1 simply due to Defoe and occasional dialogue of insights. But those insights are certainly not feminist!"
"Poor Things","reelreviewsandrecommendations","22 January 2024",910,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"Poor Things","xxxxxdarkmoon","2 March 2024",110,"This one feels off for a reason.I will tell you what that reason is, in case you overlook the obvious. According to the ratings it did happen a few times.This one (I am avoiding the term ""movie"") contains adult-only material, but that is not the problem. The problem is: that the ""monster"" has the intellect of a child if I understand it correctly. Doesn't it?Do I need to say more?Actually, this is the point where nothing more has to be said. This is distasteful. It is not recommended for sane people.This is a failed attempt at a ""comedy-drama-romance"". A sane person would not even watch the movie til the end. And by no means rate it with more than 5 stars."
"Poor Things","moviedays1","10 January 2024",110,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity."
"Poor Things","RayCharles81","28 December 2023",110,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."

Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."

Might be asking ""then why did you go see it-heck why did you stay until the very end?""
Because of the crazy hyped of reviews that were clearly written by teenagers it appears and I wasn't going to leave when I paid $14.....no wonder no one wants to see movies anymore in the theater~ what they're showing is garbage and no one wants to be THAT embarrassed into thinking they need to stay put because it's $14 spent.This was and had to have been made by either extremely high people~ or nymphomaniacs that don't want to actually tell a good story. You can tell a very great story without the use of alllllllll the sex! Seriously! Just look at Hollywood during the Hays Code Era!!!!It also felt they couldn't keep up with one plot, it threw in sooo many plots, ""finding out about life"" ""pleasure"" ""love"" ""emotions"" ""Victorian tragedy"". I felt like they tried to clump in 20 years of education down not only Bella's throat but mine as well. Learning as to why men torture women for pleasure, why bella's past life did what she did, what's really out there and why can't she go and see? I felt this was more of a tv series that clamped up scenes from each episode and just scraped it into a movie."
"Poor Things","ranwulfs","5 March 2024",110,"It took a while to really decide how I feel about this movie. I wanted to at least like it because I'm fond of Emma Stone. Her acting in this unusual role is certainly on another level, but I feel it's wasted on a terrible, terrible film. She didn't need to do this. She's talented, accomplished, popular, successful - why slum around in this brutal, nightmarish production? There's nothing good going on here. I felt sickened by half of the scenes, but staying and watching out of an admitted morbid fascination, and the disappointed hope it would somehow get better. I've seen a few of Yorgos Lanthimos's other films, and knew better than to expect something other than weird from him, but this was too much for me. Very sad that Emma Stone has decided to go in this direction in her career. I can't recommend this movie to anyone, and I'm going to do my best to forget I've seen it. I feel like I need a hot shower now to wash this horrible slime from me."
"Poor Things","parksiet","31 December 2023",410,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"Poor Things","Pjtaylor-96-138044","23 January 2024",510,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy)."
"Poor Things","Billybobble1","26 February 2024",310,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in."
"Poor Things","kjproulx","6 January 2024",1010,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever."
"Poor Things","imseeg","9 December 2023",510,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!"
"Poor Things","ThereelscoopwithKK","12 March 2024",110,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive."
"Poor Things","nicko252008","24 January 2024",210,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film."
"Poor Things","aciessi","24 December 2023",910,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
"Poor Things","pd-19490","20 January 2024",110,"My previous attempts at reviewing this were declined possibly due to how I expressed my strong opinions about the movie. I will try again with as much restraint as I can and try not to insert my opinion. So here it goes. The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she still has the mind of a child. These men know she has the mind of a child and yet continue anyway. I will let you interpret that how you will. I won't watch it again. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do."
"Poor Things","MovieCriticOnline","27 February 2024",110,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this."
"Poor Things","rgxdzrybr","1 February 2024",110,"I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either."
"Poor Things","nicolasroop","22 December 2023",910,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
"Poor Things","doppleganger19692","8 February 2024",510,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it."

After she leaves him she gets abused by men in a brothel. This film should surely win best picture as holywood ""Me too"" have surely given actresses their rights back. If this is not sick enough the child that gets abused is the baby of a mother who killed her self, well just the brain. This film would get banned, if any rating system could.

"Poor Things","Victor_Santamaria","27 January 2024",110,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."

Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different.

William Defoe is the only one who does a great job here, but again how could he want to be in it?Some say it's beautifully filmed - no it's not - the horrible, strange colors and staging is also very disconcerting.I gave it a couple up from 1 simply due to Defoe and occasional dialogue of insights. But those insights are certainly not feminist!"
"Poor Things","reelreviewsandrecommendations","22 January 2024",910,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"Poor Things","xxxxxdarkmoon","2 March 2024",110,"This one feels off for a reason.I will tell you what that reason is, in case you overlook the obvious. According to the ratings it did happen a few times.This one (I am avoiding the term ""movie"") contains adult-only material, but that is not the problem. The problem is: that the ""monster"" has the intellect of a child if I understand it correctly. Doesn't it?Do I need to say more?Actually, this is the point where nothing more has to be said. This is distasteful. It is not recommended for sane people.This is a failed attempt at a ""comedy-drama-romance"". A sane person would not even watch the movie til the end. And by no means rate it with more than 5 stars."
"Poor Things","moviedays1","10 January 2024",110,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity."
"Poor Things","RayCharles81","28 December 2023",110,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
"Poor Things","awagne-29536","28 December 2023",110,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Poor Things","acanacox","31 December 2023",110,"Did Emma Stone take career choice lessons from her best friend: Jennifer Lawrence and claim that movies that circulate around-sex- was the new ""it"" for movies?!!!! And I thought ""No hard feelings"" was awful. But this- my oh my! Both have its merits-good actors but god awful writing! No heart what's so ever in this awful piece! I don't know what's more awkward and embarrassing~ being in that theater alone while watching it or being in a full theater and watching....but I was the one all alone so it might be more embarrassing. It's basically porn~ over and over and over. Within I'd say the first 7 min~you see male genitals, and I frowned~ she's acting 4. But the hints of snickers from myself turned into ""ok this is embarrassing"" that turned into ""oh god MORE sex?"" Which turned into ""MORE nudity?!!!""
This movie is~ EH HEMMMM if-
Tim Burton clashed with Lemony Snicket clashed with Victorian age clashing with futuristic realism clashing with Wednesday clashing with Barbie clashing with blind fashion designers, clashing with science clashing with porn and Frankenstein.....
All in all~
In the words of the great goddess herself I would like to quote~Katharine Hepburn~
""It's filth. I am disgusted with the movies. DISGUSTED! They are kidding themselves into saying it's an intellectual pastime. BUNK!""
Might be asking ""then why did you go see it-heck why did you stay until the very end?""
Because of the crazy hyped of reviews that were clearly written by teenagers it appears and I wasn't going to leave when I paid $14.....no wonder no one wants to see movies anymore in the theater~ what they're showing is garbage and no one wants to be THAT embarrassed into thinking they need to stay put because it's $14 spent.This was and had to have been made by either extremely high people~ or nymphomaniacs that don't want to actually tell a good story. You can tell a very great story without the use of alllllllll the sex! Seriously! Just look at Hollywood during the Hays Code Era!!!!It also felt they couldn't keep up with one plot, it threw in sooo many plots, ""finding out about life"" ""pleasure"" ""love"" ""emotions"" ""Victorian tragedy"". I felt like they tried to clump in 20 years of education down not only Bella's throat but mine as well. Learning as to why men torture women for pleasure, why bella's past life did what she did, what's really out there and why can't she go and see? I felt this was more of a tv series that clamped up scenes from each episode and just scraped it into a movie."
"Poor Things","ranwulfs","5 March 2024",110,"It took a while to really decide how I feel about this movie. I wanted to at least like it because I'm fond of Emma Stone. Her acting in this unusual role is certainly on another level, but I feel it's wasted on a terrible, terrible film. She didn't need to do this. She's talented, accomplished, popular, successful - why slum around in this brutal, nightmarish production? There's nothing good going on here. I felt sickened by half of the scenes, but staying and watching out of an admitted morbid fascination, and the disappointed hope it would somehow get better. I've seen a few of Yorgos Lanthimos's other films, and knew better than to expect something other than weird from him, but this was too much for me. Very sad that Emma Stone has decided to go in this direction in her career. I can't recommend this movie to anyone, and I'm going to do my best to forget I've seen it. I feel like I need a hot shower now to wash this horrible slime from me."
"Poor Things","parksiet","31 December 2023",410,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"Poor Things","Pjtaylor-96-138044","23 January 2024",510,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy)."
"Poor Things","Billybobble1","26 February 2024",310,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in."
"Poor Things","kjproulx","6 January 2024",1010,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever."
"Poor Things","imseeg","9 December 2023",510,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!"
"Poor Things","ThereelscoopwithKK","12 March 2024",110,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive."
"Poor Things","nicko252008","24 January 2024",210,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film."
"Poor Things","aciessi","24 December 2023",910,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
"Poor Things","pd-19490","20 January 2024",110,"My previous attempts at reviewing this were declined possibly due to how I expressed my strong opinions about the movie. I will try again with as much restraint as I can and try not to insert my opinion. So here it goes. The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she still has the mind of a child. These men know she has the mind of a child and yet continue anyway. I will let you interpret that how you will. I won't watch it again. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do."
"Poor Things","MovieCriticOnline","27 February 2024",110,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this."
"Poor Things","rgxdzrybr","1 February 2024",110,"I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either."
"Poor Things","nicolasroop","22 December 2023",910,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
"Poor Things","doppleganger19692","8 February 2024",510,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it."
"Poor Things","lbenot","28 December 2023",110,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."

"Poor Things","Victor_Santamaria","27 January 2024",110,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
"Poor Things","francogrex","29 February 2024",110,"I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie."
"Poor Things","lbowdls","9 March 2024",310,"Yes I'm echoing all those who hate this film. I think it's pornographic, exploitative and degrading.And I don't even agree that the acting is hood. Emma Stone should not even have been nominated for an Oscar let alone (I hope she doesn't win it, I'm writing this two days from the Oscars) if she does to me it would be like giving an Academy award to a porn actress. And Mark Rufullo who I usually love in most things and makes good choices. But what the hell was he thinking here? William Defoe is the only one who does a great job here, but again how could he want to be in it?Some say it's beautifully filmed - no it's not - the horrible, strange colors and staging is also very disconcerting.I gave it a couple up from 1 simply due to Defoe and occasional dialogue of insights. But those insights are certainly not feminist!"
"Poor Things","reelreviewsandrecommendations","22 January 2024",910,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"Poor Things","xxxxxdarkmoon","2 March 2024",110,"This one feels off for a reason.I will tell you what that reason is, in case you overlook the obvious. According to the ratings it did happen a few times.This one (I am avoiding the term ""movie"") contains adult-only material, but that is not the problem. The problem is: that the ""monster"" has the intellect of a child if I understand it correctly. Doesn't it?Do I need to say more?Actually, this is the point where nothing more has to be said. This is distasteful. It is not recommended for sane people.This is a failed attempt at a ""comedy-drama-romance"". A sane person would not even watch the movie til the end. And by no means rate it with more than 5 stars."
"Poor Things","moviedays1","10 January 2024",110,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity."
"Poor Things","RayCharles81","28 December 2023",110,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."

Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."

And I thought ""No hard feelings"" was awful. But this- my oh my! Both have its merits-good actors but god awful writing! No heart what's so ever in this awful piece! I don't know what's more awkward and embarrassing~ being in that theater alone while watching it or being in a full theater and watching....but I was the one all alone so it might be more embarrassing. It's basically porn~ over and over and over. Within I'd say the first 7 min~you see male genitals, and I frowned~ she's acting 4. But the hints of snickers from myself turned into ""ok this is embarrassing"" that turned into ""oh god MORE sex?"" Which turned into ""MORE nudity?!!!""
This movie is~ EH HEMMMM if-
Tim Burton clashed with Lemony Snicket clashed with Victorian age clashing with futuristic realism clashing with Wednesday clashing with Barbie clashing with blind fashion designers, clashing with science clashing with porn and Frankenstein.....
All in all~
In the words of the great goddess herself I would like to quote~Katharine Hepburn~
""It's filth. I am disgusted with the movies. DISGUSTED! They are kidding themselves into saying it's an intellectual pastime. BUNK!""
Might be asking ""then why did you go see it-heck why did you stay until the very end?""
Because of the crazy hyped of reviews that were clearly written by teenagers it appears and I wasn't going to leave when I paid $14.....no wonder no one wants to see movies anymore in the theater~ what they're showing is garbage and no one wants to be THAT embarrassed into thinking they need to stay put because it's $14 spent.This was and had to have been made by either extremely high people~ or nymphomaniacs that don't want to actually tell a good story. You can tell a very great story without the use of alllllllll the sex! Seriously! Just look at Hollywood during the Hays Code Era!!!!It also felt they couldn't keep up with one plot, it threw in sooo many plots, ""finding out about life"" ""pleasure"" ""love"" ""emotions"" ""Victorian tragedy"". I felt like they tried to clump in 20 years of education down not only Bella's throat but mine as well. Learning as to why men torture women for pleasure, why bella's past life did what she did, what's really out there and why can't she go and see? I felt this was more of a tv series that clamped up scenes from each episode and just scraped it into a movie."
"Poor Things","ranwulfs","5 March 2024",110,"It took a while to really decide how I feel about this movie. I wanted to at least like it because I'm fond of Emma Stone. Her acting in this unusual role is certainly on another level, but I feel it's wasted on a terrible, terrible film. She didn't need to do this. She's talented, accomplished, popular, successful - why slum around in this brutal, nightmarish production? There's nothing good going on here. I felt sickened by half of the scenes, but staying and watching out of an admitted morbid fascination, and the disappointed hope it would somehow get better. I've seen a few of Yorgos Lanthimos's other films, and knew better than to expect something other than weird from him, but this was too much for me. Very sad that Emma Stone has decided to go in this direction in her career. I can't recommend this movie to anyone, and I'm going to do my best to forget I've seen it.

"Poor Things","Pjtaylor-96-138044","23 January 2024",510,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy)."
"Poor Things","Billybobble1","26 February 2024",310,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in."
"Poor Things","kjproulx","6 January 2024",1010,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever."
"Poor Things","imseeg","9 December 2023",510,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!"
"Poor Things","ThereelscoopwithKK","12 March 2024",110,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive."
"Poor Things","nicko252008","24 January 2024",210,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film."
"Poor Things","aciessi","24 December 2023",910,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
"Poor Things","pd-19490","20 January 2024",110,"My previous attempts at reviewing this were declined possibly due to how I expressed my strong opinions about the movie. I will try again with as much restraint as I can and try not to insert my opinion. So here it goes. The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she still has the mind of a child. These men know she has the mind of a child and yet continue anyway. I will let you interpret that how you will. I won't watch it again. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do."
"Poor Things","MovieCriticOnline","27 February 2024",110,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this."
"Poor Things","rgxdzrybr","1 February 2024",110,"I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either."
"Poor Things","nicolasroop","22 December 2023",910,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
"Poor Things","doppleganger19692","8 February 2024",510,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it."
"Poor Things","lbenot","28 December 2023",110,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
"Poor Things","allanmichael30","10 March 2024",110,"Why is this file so vile, its main story is the innocence of a child thrown in to a adult world. The adults raising her are sick and twisted and she runs away only to be abused by a sick vile man(played by mark ruffalo) who abuses the young child and a pedophilia. After she leaves him she gets abused by men in a brothel. This film should surely win best picture as holywood ""Me too"" have surely given actresses their rights back. If this is not sick enough the child that gets abused is the baby of a mother who killed her self, well just the brain. This film would get banned, if any rating system could. The acting of william defoe was very good, how ever the plot was just weird and even had husband of dead woman wanting to have relationship with own daughter."
"Poor Things","Victor_Santamaria","27 January 2024",110,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
"Poor Things","francogrex","29 February 2024",110,"I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie."
"Poor Things","lbowdls","9 March 2024",310,"Yes I'm echoing all those who hate this film. I think it's pornographic, exploitative and degrading.And I don't even agree that the acting is hood. Emma Stone should not even have been nominated for an Oscar let alone (I hope she doesn't win it, I'm writing this two days from the Oscars) if she does to me it would be like giving an Academy award to a porn actress. And Mark Rufullo who I usually love in most things and makes good choices. But what the hell was he thinking here? William Defoe is the only one who does a great job here, but again how could he want to be in it?Some say it's beautifully filmed - no it's not - the horrible, strange colors and staging is also very disconcerting.I gave it a couple up from 1 simply due to Defoe and occasional dialogue of insights. But those insights are certainly not feminist!"
"Poor Things","reelreviewsandrecommendations","22 January 2024",910,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"Poor Things","xxxxxdarkmoon","2 March 2024",110,"This one feels off for a reason.I will tell you what that reason is, in case you overlook the obvious. According to the ratings it did happen a few times.This one (I am avoiding the term ""movie"") contains adult-only material, but that is not the problem. The problem is: that the ""monster"" has the intellect of a child if I understand it correctly. Doesn't it?Do I need to say more?Actually, this is the point where nothing more has to be said. This is distasteful. It is not recommended for sane people.This is a failed attempt at a ""comedy-drama-romance"". A sane person would not even watch the movie til the end. And by no means rate it with more than 5 stars."
"Poor Things","moviedays1","10 January 2024",110,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity."
"Poor Things","RayCharles81","28 December 2023",110,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
"Poor Things","awagne-29536","28 December 2023",110,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."

And I thought ""No hard feelings"" was awful. But this- my oh my! Both have its merits-good actors but god awful writing! No heart what's so ever in this awful piece! I don't know what's more awkward and embarrassing~ being in that theater alone while watching it or being in a full theater and watching....but I was the one all alone so it might be more embarrassing. It's basically porn~ over and over and over. Within I'd say the first 7 min~you see male genitals, and I frowned~ she's acting 4. But the hints of snickers from myself turned into ""ok this is embarrassing"" that turned into ""oh god MORE sex?"" Which turned into ""MORE nudity?!!!""
This movie is~ EH HEMMMM if-
Tim Burton clashed with Lemony Snicket clashed with Victorian age clashing with futuristic realism clashing with Wednesday clashing with Barbie clashing with blind fashion designers, clashing with science clashing with porn and Frankenstein.....
All in all~
In the words of the great goddess herself I would like to quote~Katharine Hepburn~
""It's filth. I am disgusted with the movies. DISGUSTED! They are kidding themselves into saying it's an intellectual pastime. BUNK!""
Might be asking ""then why did you go see it-heck why did you stay until the very end?""
Because of the crazy hyped of reviews that were clearly written by teenagers it appears and I wasn't going to leave when I paid $14.....no wonder no one wants to see movies anymore in the theater~ what they're showing is garbage and no one wants to be THAT embarrassed into thinking they need to stay put because it's $14 spent.This was and had to have been made by either extremely high people~ or nymphomaniacs that don't want to actually tell a good story. You can tell a very great story without the use of alllllllll the sex! Seriously! Just look at Hollywood during the Hays Code Era!!!!It also felt they couldn't keep up with one plot, it threw in sooo many plots, ""finding out about life"" ""pleasure"" ""love"" ""emotions"" ""Victorian tragedy"". I felt like they tried to clump in 20 years of education down not only Bella's throat but mine as well. Learning as to why men torture women for pleasure, why bella's past life did what she did, what's really out there and why can't she go and see? I felt this was more of a tv series that clamped up scenes from each episode and just scraped it into a movie."
"Poor Things","ranwulfs","5 March 2024",110,"It took a while to really decide how I feel about this movie. I wanted to at least like it because I'm fond of Emma Stone. Her acting in this unusual role is certainly on another level, but I feel it's wasted on a terrible, terrible film. She didn't need to do this. She's talented, accomplished, popular, successful - why slum around in this brutal, nightmarish production? There's nothing good going on here. I felt sickened by half of the scenes, but staying and watching out of an admitted morbid fascination, and the disappointed hope it would somehow get better. I've seen a few of Yorgos Lanthimos's other films, and knew better than to expect something other than weird from him, but this was too much for me. Very sad that Emma Stone has decided to go in this direction in her career. I can't recommend this movie to anyone, and I'm going to do my best to forget I've seen it.

I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"Poor Things","Pjtaylor-96-138044","23 January 2024",510,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy)."
"Poor Things","Billybobble1","26 February 2024",310,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in."
"Poor Things","kjproulx","6 January 2024",1010,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever."
"Poor Things","imseeg","9 December 2023",510,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!"
"Poor Things","ThereelscoopwithKK","12 March 2024",110,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive."
"Poor Things","nicko252008","24 January 2024",210,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film."
"Poor Things","aciessi","24 December 2023",910,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
"Poor Things","pd-19490","20 January 2024",110,"My previous attempts at reviewing this were declined possibly due to how I expressed my strong opinions about the movie. I will try again with as much restraint as I can and try not to insert my opinion. So here it goes. The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she still has the mind of a child. These men know she has the mind of a child and yet continue anyway. I will let you interpret that how you will. I won't watch it again. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do."
"Poor Things","MovieCriticOnline","27 February 2024",110,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this."
"Poor Things","rgxdzrybr","1 February 2024",110,"I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either."
"Poor Things","nicolasroop","22 December 2023",910,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
"Poor Things","doppleganger19692","8 February 2024",510,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it."

In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."

After she leaves him she gets abused by men in a brothel. This film should surely win best picture as holywood ""Me too"" have surely given actresses their rights back. If this is not sick enough the child that gets abused is the baby of a mother who killed her self, well just the brain. This film would get banned, if any rating system could.

"Poor Things","Victor_Santamaria","27 January 2024",110,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing."
"Poor Things","francogrex","29 February 2024",110,"I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie."

Emma Stone should not even have been nominated for an Oscar let alone (I hope she doesn't win it, I'm writing this two days from the Oscars) if she does to me it would be like giving an Academy award to a porn actress. And Mark Rufullo who I usually love in most things and makes good choices. But what the hell was he thinking here? William Defoe is the only one who does a great job here, but again how could he want to be in it?Some say it's beautifully filmed - no it's not - the horrible, strange colors and staging is also very disconcerting.I gave it a couple up from 1 simply due to Defoe and occasional dialogue of insights. But those insights are certainly not feminist!"
"Poor Things","reelreviewsandrecommendations","22 January 2024",910,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"Poor Things","xxxxxdarkmoon","2 March 2024",110,"This one feels off for a reason.I will tell you what that reason is, in case you overlook the obvious. According to the ratings it did happen a few times.This one (I am avoiding the term ""movie"") contains adult-only material, but that is not the problem. The problem is: that the ""monster"" has the intellect of a child if I understand it correctly. Doesn't it?Do I need to say more?Actually, this is the point where nothing more has to be said. This is distasteful. It is not recommended for sane people.This is a failed attempt at a ""comedy-drama-romance"". A sane person would not even watch the movie til the end. And by no means rate it with more than 5 stars."
"Poor Things","moviedays1","10 January 2024",110,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity."
"Poor Things","RayCharles81","28 December 2023",110,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there."
"Poor Things","awagne-29536","28 December 2023",110,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Poor Things","acanacox","31 December 2023",110,"Did Emma Stone take career choice lessons from her best friend: Jennifer Lawrence and claim that movies that circulate around-sex- was the new ""it"" for movies?!!!! And I thought ""No hard feelings"" was awful. But this- my oh my! Both have its merits-good actors but god awful writing! No heart what's so ever in this awful piece! I don't know what's more awkward and embarrassing~ being in that theater alone while watching it or being in a full theater and watching....but I was the one all alone so it might be more embarrassing. It's basically porn~ over and over and over. Within I'd say the first 7 min~you see male genitals, and I frowned~ she's acting 4. But the hints of snickers from myself turned into ""ok this is embarrassing"" that turned into ""oh god MORE sex?"" Which turned into ""MORE nudity?!!!""
This movie is~ EH HEMMMM if-
Tim Burton clashed with Lemony Snicket clashed with Victorian age clashing with futuristic realism clashing with Wednesday clashing with Barbie clashing with blind fashion designers, clashing with science clashing with porn and Frankenstein.....
All in all~
In the words of the great goddess herself I would like to quote~Katharine Hepburn~
""It's filth. I am disgusted with the movies. DISGUSTED! They are kidding themselves into saying it's an intellectual pastime. BUNK!""
Might be asking ""then why did you go see it-heck why did you stay until the very end?""
Because of the crazy hyped of reviews that were clearly written by teenagers it appears and I wasn't going to leave when I paid $14.....no wonder no one wants to see movies anymore in the theater~ what they're showing is garbage and no one wants to be THAT embarrassed into thinking they need to stay put because it's $14 spent.This was and had to have been made by either extremely high people~ or nymphomaniacs that don't want to actually tell a good story. You can tell a very great story without the use of alllllllll the sex! Seriously! Just look at Hollywood during the Hays Code Era!!!!It also felt they couldn't keep up with one plot, it threw in sooo many plots, ""finding out about life"" ""pleasure"" ""love"" ""emotions"" ""Victorian tragedy"". I felt like they tried to clump in 20 years of education down not only Bella's throat but mine as well. Learning as to why men torture women for pleasure, why bella's past life did what she did, what's really out there and why can't she go and see? I felt this was more of a tv series that clamped up scenes from each episode and just scraped it into a movie."
"Poor Things","ranwulfs","5 March 2024",110,"It took a while to really decide how I feel about this movie. I wanted to at least like it because I'm fond of Emma Stone. Her acting in this unusual role is certainly on another level, but I feel it's wasted on a terrible, terrible film. She didn't need to do this. She's talented, accomplished, popular, successful - why slum around in this brutal, nightmarish production? There's nothing good going on here. I felt sickened by half of the scenes, but staying and watching out of an admitted morbid fascination, and the disappointed hope it would somehow get better. I've seen a few of Yorgos Lanthimos's other films, and knew better than to expect something other than weird from him, but this was too much for me. Very sad that Emma Stone has decided to go in this direction in her career. I can't recommend this movie to anyone, and I'm going to do my best to forget I've seen it. I feel like I need a hot shower now to wash this horrible slime from me."
