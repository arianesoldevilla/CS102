"Poor Things","kjproulx","6 January 2024",NA,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever."
"Poor Things","aciessi","24 December 2023",NA,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
"Poor Things","parksiet","31 December 2023",NA,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"Poor Things","Pjtaylor-96-138044","23 January 2024",NA,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naive and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy)."
"Poor Things","nicolasroop","22 December 2023",NA,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
"Poor Things","reelreviewsandrecommendations","22 January 2024",NA,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"Poor Things","Lepidopterous_","8 December 2023",NA,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Poor Things","Camerenth","15 December 2023",NA,"The story is so bizarre and what occurs can only be explained as a chaos of emotions but the movie translates that into one of the best coming of age stories I have ever seen. Emma Stone is the star of this movie. She carries the movie's bizarre scenes and dives fully into the this chaotic character. The movie does not shy away from its R rating and challenges the audience on what to feel during those moments. The supporting cast is just as weird and quirky in all the best ways. Mark Ruffalo especially is almost unrecognizable from his recent roles but is a lovable stand out and is usually the centerpiece of many of the jokes of the movie. This is a must watch for its original story and beautiful world it creates."
"Poor Things","evanston_dad","19 December 2023",NA,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
"Poor Things","MattyLuke-81663","20 November 2023",NA,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
"Poor Things","imseeg","9 December 2023",NA,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
"Poor Things","UniqueParticle","29 December 2023",NA,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
"Poor Things","laurenspierre","19 October 2023",NA,"""She's like nothing you've ever seen""The same can be said for this film, which I saw at Film Fest Gent in a packed theater. It was the 5th film of the day for all of us there, but the audience was lively and exuberant. And it's no wonder, since Poor Things is nothing short of a monumental achievement: it is at once the funniest, smartest, best looking and most entertaining film of 2023. With its radical inventiveness and audacious creativity, this masterpiece may turn out to be viewed as a cinematic milestone by future generations. At the very least, Poor Things is Yorgos Lanthimos' magnum opus and deserving of instant classic status.The plot outline for Poor Things could be described as Frankenstein with a modern, feminist twist, with Godwin 'God' Baxter (William Dafoe) assuming the role of the doctor who brings Bella Baxter (Emma Stone) back from the dead. As an adult woman equipped with the brain of an infant, Bella is blessed with the intense curiosity and sense of wonder that only a newborn can have. She quickly develops a will of her own and it isn't long before she escapes her imposed confinement (shades of Lanthimos' debut film Dogtooth) by running off with smarmy lawyer Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo) on a journey of exploration of both herself and the world.I cannot say enough about the breathtaking cinematography and spectacular production design of this film, which is quite frankly atypical of what I'd had to come expect from a Lanthimos film. Not that his previous films have looked bad, but ""visually striking"" is just not what pops up first when calling to mind his films. The first act, which takes place at Dr. Baxter's mansion, is filmed in gorgeous black and white (a nod to the original Frankenstein adaptation perhaps?) and already displays some bold artistic choices, such as the frequent use of fish-eye lenses to create distorted images. But it is once Bella embarks on her adventure into the outside world that we realize we're not in Kansas anymore. Stunning visuals of luscious sets and amazing costumes in impossibly vivid colors light up the screen, as we discover an exaggeratedly artificial world through Bella's perspective, being one of childlike bewilderment.Emma Stone gives a career-defining performance as Bella Baxter. When we first meet her, Bella is less a person than a stumbling 'creature' equipped with the vocabulary of a child. Stone does an excellent job of portraying Bella's development towards becoming a 'real person', by gradually improving her grasp of language and her manner of walking, to name just a couple of things. She also convincingly sells the incredible character arc that Bella goes through during this film. It's a physically and mentally demanding role, the kind of performance they usually hand out Oscars for.William Dafoe is perfectly cast as mad scientist Godwin Baxter, who looks more like the monster of Frankenstein than the doctor that created him. Dafoe unsurprisingly does a fantastic job here, knowingly leaning into the absurdity of the story with some of his delivery, but still playing his character sincerely.A special mention has to go to Mark Ruffalo as Duncan Wedderburn here, the impossibly suave globetrotter and self-proclaimed ladykiller who brings temptation into Bella's life and takes her into the wide world. Ruffalo chews the scenery, playing Wedderburn almost as a parody of the archetypical smooth womanizer and delivering his lines with visible glee. But his histrionics actually suit the arc of his character perfectly, as he is eventually driven to utter madness by Bella's insatiable taste for sexual and intellectual exploration and the often irrefutable logic she uses to explain her actions and dismiss his complaints.However, Poor Things doesn't only overwhelm with its abundance of style and larger-than-life performances, it has something to say too. As Bella, with the voraciousness a child, develops a taste for both sexual and intellectual gratification, the film cleverly uses her unbiased perspective to ask seemingly logical questions about some of the the established gender roles and class roles she perceives in the world around her. Who would have thought that Yorgos Lanthimos, the Greek director known for his idiosyncratic style, which often expresses a cynical worldview through pitch-black, deadpan comedy, would be the one to deliver not only the most visually dazzling film of 2023, but also the most piercing critique of the patriarchy and established gender roles? (looking at you there, Barbie)Time will tell if Poor Things will be heralded as the game changer that I personally envision it to be, but at the very least we can just be happy that such a defiantly original and wonderfully creative film was made to be consumed by a mainstream audience here in 2023. As long as this kind of uniquely cinematic experience continues to exist, we can look optimistically at the future of the medium. Go see this film!"
"Poor Things","drownsoda90","22 December 2023",NA,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."

But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Poor Things","nicko252008","24 January 2024",NA,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film."
"Poor Things","jeff-gibson-835-273379","22 January 2024",NA,"High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
"Poor Things","Sleepin_Dragon","9 January 2024",NA,"Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
"Poor Things","pd-19490","20 January 2024",NA,"My previous attempts at reviewing this were declined possibly due to how I expressed my strong opinions about the movie. I will try again with as much restraint as I can and try not to insert my opinion. So here it goes. The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she still has the mind of a child. These men know she has the mind of a child and yet continue anyway. I will let you interpret that how you will. I won't watch it again. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do."

Instead of dying on impact, she's dragged from the water, barely alive by a crazed doctor.The doctor decides that rather than nurse her back to health, he'll do a cesarean, and remove the mother's brain and replace it with her baby's, as her brain must have been bad if she were suicidal.The entire rest of the film is Emma Stone having sex and going full *Tropic Thunder warning* for the entire film. Full frontal nudity of both sexes throughout.The doctor's assistant agrees to marry Emma Stone (baby brain in mother's body) despite the fact she is so mentally handicapped, she can barely walk or form a complete sentence. Nevermind that's a huge breech of the duty of care between a provider and a patient, nevermind that the patient can't consent due to her disability and doesn't know what marriage even is, nevermind it's a LITERAL INFANT in an adult woman's body. Basically it's a one-sided Freaky Friday, except all Emma Stone's character wants to do is have sex non-stop.The doctor's assistant is considered the goog guy in the film, while the audience is tortured with shots of Emma Stone having predators have sex with her and then tire of her as she becomes less infantile. Emma decides to become a bisexual prostitute who then relaces her original sadistic husband's brain with that of a goat after he tries to drug her and have her clitoris removed.What is the message of this film? That without the chains of society, innocent children would do nothing but masterbate or have sex with adults? Emma Stone's character literally masturbates with an apple (!!!) at the dinner table. Why?On top of the egregious filth of a script, it's STEAMPUNK.Seriously, who wrote this script? Josh Duggar? Jimmy Saville?I don't care how nice the filming is or the costumes when this is the story.

"Poor Things","moviedays1","10 January 2024",NA,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity."
"Poor Things","awagne-29536","28 December 2023",NA,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Poor Things","pedroquintaoo","30 January 2024",NA,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."

In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
"Poor Things","SwissCheeze","3 January 2024",NA,"I wanted to like this film...but no. This film is just disturbing, and not in a good way. The film is about an INFANT who has her brain put into a woman's (the infant's mom) body. While the character may look like an adult, she is not...she is a CHILD. Let's make that clear.Immediately the child starts masturbating. Okay, uncomfortable, but maybe the director has something to say. So I stick with it. Next thing you know the child's father is offering her up to get married by his adult assistant who KNOWS that he is proposing to a child. A few scenes later Mark Ruffalo's character sneaks into her room, molests her and kidnaps her where he has rampant sex with her for several excruitatingly long scenes that span weeks if not months.It's crass and it's tasteless given that the character is a little girl with an adult woman's body, but again, while I wince, I'm assuming that it's going to all come together with some powerful social commentary that will be poignant and insightful. I'm mean, the reviews are stellar. Surely this will not be for naught...right?What is the characters big revelatory moment? She finds her agency by becoming a prostitute and - voila! - she's a complete human, a feminist at that! So essentially you have this little girl go through some seriously traumatic sexual abuse (replete with director awkwardly shows her insatiable desire for sex with adult men by having her literally beg for it constantly)...and then by ""embracing"" prostitution she is somehow magically ""liberated"" and transforms into a self-actualized being. Okay then.Not only is this some poorly thought out social commentary and character development, but it's quite warped and disturbed if you let it sink in. This just felt like some perverted guy wrapping some sordid child sex abuse fantasy with a flimsy facade of female empowerment, except that empowerment isn't earned or justified given what happens in the story. Actually, I would say quite the opposite.Add in some really heavy handed and poorly construed themes (e.g., she literally refers to her father -like figure God...really now?) and some seriously forced situational comedy and you have just an insufferable film.The only bright side for me was the art direction and costume design. All style, no substance."
"Poor Things","kjproulx","6 January 2024",NA,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever."
"Poor Things","aciessi","24 December 2023",NA,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."

And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"Poor Things","Pjtaylor-96-138044","23 January 2024",NA,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naive and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy)."
"Poor Things","nicolasroop","22 December 2023",NA,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
"Poor Things","reelreviewsandrecommendations","22 January 2024",NA,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"Poor Things","Lepidopterous_","8 December 2023",NA,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Poor Things","Camerenth","15 December 2023",NA,"The story is so bizarre and what occurs can only be explained as a chaos of emotions but the movie translates that into one of the best coming of age stories I have ever seen. Emma Stone is the star of this movie. She carries the movie's bizarre scenes and dives fully into the this chaotic character. The movie does not shy away from its R rating and challenges the audience on what to feel during those moments. The supporting cast is just as weird and quirky in all the best ways. Mark Ruffalo especially is almost unrecognizable from his recent roles but is a lovable stand out and is usually the centerpiece of many of the jokes of the movie. This is a must watch for its original story and beautiful world it creates."
"Poor Things","evanston_dad","19 December 2023",NA,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
"Poor Things","MattyLuke-81663","20 November 2023",NA,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
"Poor Things","imseeg","9 December 2023",NA,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
"Poor Things","UniqueParticle","29 December 2023",NA,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
"Poor Things","laurenspierre","19 October 2023",NA,"""She's like nothing you've ever seen""The same can be said for this film, which I saw at Film Fest Gent in a packed theater. It was the 5th film of the day for all of us there, but the audience was lively and exuberant. And it's no wonder, since Poor Things is nothing short of a monumental achievement: it is at once the funniest, smartest, best looking and most entertaining film of 2023. With its radical inventiveness and audacious creativity, this masterpiece may turn out to be viewed as a cinematic milestone by future generations. At the very least, Poor Things is Yorgos Lanthimos' magnum opus and deserving of instant classic status.The plot outline for Poor Things could be described as Frankenstein with a modern, feminist twist, with Godwin 'God' Baxter (William Dafoe) assuming the role of the doctor who brings Bella Baxter (Emma Stone) back from the dead. As an adult woman equipped with the brain of an infant, Bella is blessed with the intense curiosity and sense of wonder that only a newborn can have. She quickly develops a will of her own and it isn't long before she escapes her imposed confinement (shades of Lanthimos' debut film Dogtooth) by running off with smarmy lawyer Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo) on a journey of exploration of both herself and the world.I cannot say enough about the breathtaking cinematography and spectacular production design of this film, which is quite frankly atypical of what I'd had to come expect from a Lanthimos film. Not that his previous films have looked bad, but ""visually striking"" is just not what pops up first when calling to mind his films. The first act, which takes place at Dr. Baxter's mansion, is filmed in gorgeous black and white (a nod to the original Frankenstein adaptation perhaps?) and already displays some bold artistic choices, such as the frequent use of fish-eye lenses to create distorted images. But it is once Bella embarks on her adventure into the outside world that we realize we're not in Kansas anymore. Stunning visuals of luscious sets and amazing costumes in impossibly vivid colors light up the screen, as we discover an exaggeratedly artificial world through Bella's perspective, being one of childlike bewilderment.Emma Stone gives a career-defining performance as Bella Baxter. When we first meet her, Bella is less a person than a stumbling 'creature' equipped with the vocabulary of a child. Stone does an excellent job of portraying Bella's development towards becoming a 'real person', by gradually improving her grasp of language and her manner of walking, to name just a couple of things. She also convincingly sells the incredible character arc that Bella goes through during this film. It's a physically and mentally demanding role, the kind of performance they usually hand out Oscars for.William Dafoe is perfectly cast as mad scientist Godwin Baxter, who looks more like the monster of Frankenstein than the doctor that created him. Dafoe unsurprisingly does a fantastic job here, knowingly leaning into the absurdity of the story with some of his delivery, but still playing his character sincerely.A special mention has to go to Mark Ruffalo as Duncan Wedderburn here, the impossibly suave globetrotter and self-proclaimed ladykiller who brings temptation into Bella's life and takes her into the wide world. Ruffalo chews the scenery, playing Wedderburn almost as a parody of the archetypical smooth womanizer and delivering his lines with visible glee. But his histrionics actually suit the arc of his character perfectly, as he is eventually driven to utter madness by Bella's insatiable taste for sexual and intellectual exploration and the often irrefutable logic she uses to explain her actions and dismiss his complaints.However, Poor Things doesn't only overwhelm with its abundance of style and larger-than-life performances, it has something to say too. As Bella, with the voraciousness a child, develops a taste for both sexual and intellectual gratification, the film cleverly uses her unbiased perspective to ask seemingly logical questions about some of the the established gender roles and class roles she perceives in the world around her. Who would have thought that Yorgos Lanthimos, the Greek director known for his idiosyncratic style, which often expresses a cynical worldview through pitch-black, deadpan comedy, would be the one to deliver not only the most visually dazzling film of 2023, but also the most piercing critique of the patriarchy and established gender roles? (looking at you there, Barbie)Time will tell if Poor Things will be heralded as the game changer that I personally envision it to be, but at the very least we can just be happy that such a defiantly original and wonderfully creative film was made to be consumed by a mainstream audience here in 2023. As long as this kind of uniquely cinematic experience continues to exist, we can look optimistically at the future of the medium. Go see this film!"
"Poor Things","drownsoda90","22 December 2023",NA,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
"Poor Things","Xstal","14 January 2024",NA,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Poor Things","nicko252008","24 January 2024",NA,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film."
"Poor Things","jeff-gibson-835-273379","22 January 2024",NA,"High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"

I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."

I will try again with as much restraint as I can and try not to insert my opinion. So here it goes. The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she still has the mind of a child. These men know she has the mind of a child and yet continue anyway. I will let you interpret that how you will. I won't watch it again. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do."
"Poor Things","rachelnstephens","1 January 2024",NA,"Pregnant woman jumps off bridge to escape her sadistic husband. Instead of dying on impact, she's dragged from the water, barely alive by a crazed doctor.The doctor decides that rather than nurse her back to health, he'll do a cesarean, and remove the mother's brain and replace it with her baby's, as her brain must have been bad if she were suicidal.The entire rest of the film is Emma Stone having sex and going full *Tropic Thunder warning* for the entire film. Full frontal nudity of both sexes throughout.The doctor's assistant agrees to marry Emma Stone (baby brain in mother's body) despite the fact she is so mentally handicapped, she can barely walk or form a complete sentence. Nevermind that's a huge breech of the duty of care between a provider and a patient, nevermind that the patient can't consent due to her disability and doesn't know what marriage even is, nevermind it's a LITERAL INFANT in an adult woman's body. Basically it's a one-sided Freaky Friday, except all Emma Stone's character wants to do is have sex non-stop.The doctor's assistant is considered the goog guy in the film, while the audience is tortured with shots of Emma Stone having predators have sex with her and then tire of her as she becomes less infantile. Emma decides to become a bisexual prostitute who then relaces her original sadistic husband's brain with that of a goat after he tries to drug her and have her clitoris removed.What is the message of this film? That without the chains of society, innocent children would do nothing but masterbate or have sex with adults? Emma Stone's character literally masturbates with an apple (!!!) at the dinner table.

"Poor Things","moviedays1","10 January 2024",NA,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity."
"Poor Things","awagne-29536","28 December 2023",NA,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Poor Things","pedroquintaoo","30 January 2024",NA,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"Poor Things","lbenot","28 December 2023",NA,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
"Poor Things","SwissCheeze","3 January 2024",NA,"I wanted to like this film...but no. This film is just disturbing, and not in a good way. The film is about an INFANT who has her brain put into a woman's (the infant's mom) body. While the character may look like an adult, she is not...she is a CHILD. Let's make that clear.Immediately the child starts masturbating. Okay, uncomfortable, but maybe the director has something to say. So I stick with it. Next thing you know the child's father is offering her up to get married by his adult assistant who KNOWS that he is proposing to a child. A few scenes later Mark Ruffalo's character sneaks into her room, molests her and kidnaps her where he has rampant sex with her for several excruitatingly long scenes that span weeks if not months.It's crass and it's tasteless given that the character is a little girl with an adult woman's body, but again, while I wince, I'm assuming that it's going to all come together with some powerful social commentary that will be poignant and insightful. I'm mean, the reviews are stellar. Surely this will not be for naught...right?What is the characters big revelatory moment? She finds her agency by becoming a prostitute and - voila! - she's a complete human, a feminist at that! So essentially you have this little girl go through some seriously traumatic sexual abuse (replete with director awkwardly shows her insatiable desire for sex with adult men by having her literally beg for it constantly)...and then by ""embracing"" prostitution she is somehow magically ""liberated"" and transforms into a self-actualized being. Okay then.Not only is this some poorly thought out social commentary and character development, but it's quite warped and disturbed if you let it sink in. This just felt like some perverted guy wrapping some sordid child sex abuse fantasy with a flimsy facade of female empowerment, except that empowerment isn't earned or justified given what happens in the story. Actually, I would say quite the opposite.Add in some really heavy handed and poorly construed themes (e.g., she literally refers to her father -like figure God...really now?) and some seriously forced situational comedy and you have just an insufferable film.The only bright side for me was the art direction and costume design. All style, no substance."
"Poor Things","kjproulx","6 January 2024",NA,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever."
"Poor Things","aciessi","24 December 2023",NA,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
"Poor Things","parksiet","31 December 2023",NA,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"Poor Things","Pjtaylor-96-138044","23 January 2024",NA,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naive and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy)."
"Poor Things","nicolasroop","22 December 2023",NA,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
"Poor Things","reelreviewsandrecommendations","22 January 2024",NA,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"Poor Things","Lepidopterous_","8 December 2023",NA,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Poor Things","Camerenth","15 December 2023",NA,"The story is so bizarre and what occurs can only be explained as a chaos of emotions but the movie translates that into one of the best coming of age stories I have ever seen. Emma Stone is the star of this movie. She carries the movie's bizarre scenes and dives fully into the this chaotic character. The movie does not shy away from its R rating and challenges the audience on what to feel during those moments. The supporting cast is just as weird and quirky in all the best ways. Mark Ruffalo especially is almost unrecognizable from his recent roles but is a lovable stand out and is usually the centerpiece of many of the jokes of the movie. This is a must watch for its original story and beautiful world it creates."
"Poor Things","evanston_dad","19 December 2023",NA,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
"Poor Things","MattyLuke-81663","20 November 2023",NA,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
"Poor Things","imseeg","9 December 2023",NA,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
"Poor Things","UniqueParticle","29 December 2023",NA,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
"Poor Things","laurenspierre","19 October 2023",NA,"""She's like nothing you've ever seen""The same can be said for this film, which I saw at Film Fest Gent in a packed theater. It was the 5th film of the day for all of us there, but the audience was lively and exuberant. And it's no wonder, since Poor Things is nothing short of a monumental achievement: it is at once the funniest, smartest, best looking and most entertaining film of 2023. With its radical inventiveness and audacious creativity, this masterpiece may turn out to be viewed as a cinematic milestone by future generations. At the very least, Poor Things is Yorgos Lanthimos' magnum opus and deserving of instant classic status.The plot outline for Poor Things could be described as Frankenstein with a modern, feminist twist, with Godwin 'God' Baxter (William Dafoe) assuming the role of the doctor who brings Bella Baxter (Emma Stone) back from the dead. As an adult woman equipped with the brain of an infant, Bella is blessed with the intense curiosity and sense of wonder that only a newborn can have. She quickly develops a will of her own and it isn't long before she escapes her imposed confinement (shades of Lanthimos' debut film Dogtooth) by running off with smarmy lawyer Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo) on a journey of exploration of both herself and the world.I cannot say enough about the breathtaking cinematography and spectacular production design of this film, which is quite frankly atypical of what I'd had to come expect from a Lanthimos film. Not that his previous films have looked bad, but ""visually striking"" is just not what pops up first when calling to mind his films. The first act, which takes place at Dr. Baxter's mansion, is filmed in gorgeous black and white (a nod to the original Frankenstein adaptation perhaps?) and already displays some bold artistic choices, such as the frequent use of fish-eye lenses to create distorted images. But it is once Bella embarks on her adventure into the outside world that we realize we're not in Kansas anymore. Stunning visuals of luscious sets and amazing costumes in impossibly vivid colors light up the screen, as we discover an exaggeratedly artificial world through Bella's perspective, being one of childlike bewilderment.Emma Stone gives a career-defining performance as Bella Baxter. When we first meet her, Bella is less a person than a stumbling 'creature' equipped with the vocabulary of a child. Stone does an excellent job of portraying Bella's development towards becoming a 'real person', by gradually improving her grasp of language and her manner of walking, to name just a couple of things. She also convincingly sells the incredible character arc that Bella goes through during this film. It's a physically and mentally demanding role, the kind of performance they usually hand out Oscars for.William Dafoe is perfectly cast as mad scientist Godwin Baxter, who looks more like the monster of Frankenstein than the doctor that created him. Dafoe unsurprisingly does a fantastic job here, knowingly leaning into the absurdity of the story with some of his delivery, but still playing his character sincerely.A special mention has to go to Mark Ruffalo as Duncan Wedderburn here, the impossibly suave globetrotter and self-proclaimed ladykiller who brings temptation into Bella's life and takes her into the wide world. Ruffalo chews the scenery, playing Wedderburn almost as a parody of the archetypical smooth womanizer and delivering his lines with visible glee. But his histrionics actually suit the arc of his character perfectly, as he is eventually driven to utter madness by Bella's insatiable taste for sexual and intellectual exploration and the often irrefutable logic she uses to explain her actions and dismiss his complaints.However, Poor Things doesn't only overwhelm with its abundance of style and larger-than-life performances, it has something to say too. As Bella, with the voraciousness a child, develops a taste for both sexual and intellectual gratification, the film cleverly uses her unbiased perspective to ask seemingly logical questions about some of the the established gender roles and class roles she perceives in the world around her. Who would have thought that Yorgos Lanthimos, the Greek director known for his idiosyncratic style, which often expresses a cynical worldview through pitch-black, deadpan comedy, would be the one to deliver not only the most visually dazzling film of 2023, but also the most piercing critique of the patriarchy and established gender roles? (looking at you there, Barbie)Time will tell if Poor Things will be heralded as the game changer that I personally envision it to be, but at the very least we can just be happy that such a defiantly original and wonderfully creative film was made to be consumed by a mainstream audience here in 2023. As long as this kind of uniquely cinematic experience continues to exist, we can look optimistically at the future of the medium. Go see this film!"
"Poor Things","drownsoda90","22 December 2023",NA,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."

He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Poor Things","nicko252008","24 January 2024",NA,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film."

Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"

I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
"Poor Things","pd-19490","20 January 2024",NA,"My previous attempts at reviewing this were declined possibly due to how I expressed my strong opinions about the movie. I will try again with as much restraint as I can and try not to insert my opinion. So here it goes. The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she still has the mind of a child. These men know she has the mind of a child and yet continue anyway. I will let you interpret that how you will. I won't watch it again. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do."
"Poor Things","rachelnstephens","1 January 2024",NA,"Pregnant woman jumps off bridge to escape her sadistic husband. Instead of dying on impact, she's dragged from the water, barely alive by a crazed doctor.The doctor decides that rather than nurse her back to health, he'll do a cesarean, and remove the mother's brain and replace it with her baby's, as her brain must have been bad if she were suicidal.The entire rest of the film is Emma Stone having sex and going full *Tropic Thunder warning* for the entire film. Full frontal nudity of both sexes throughout.The doctor's assistant agrees to marry Emma Stone (baby brain in mother's body) despite the fact she is so mentally handicapped, she can barely walk or form a complete sentence. Nevermind that's a huge breech of the duty of care between a provider and a patient, nevermind that the patient can't consent due to her disability and doesn't know what marriage even is, nevermind it's a LITERAL INFANT in an adult woman's body. Basically it's a one-sided Freaky Friday, except all Emma Stone's character wants to do is have sex non-stop.The doctor's assistant is considered the goog guy in the film, while the audience is tortured with shots of Emma Stone having predators have sex with her and then tire of her as she becomes less infantile. Emma decides to become a bisexual prostitute who then relaces her original sadistic husband's brain with that of a goat after he tries to drug her and have her clitoris removed.What is the message of this film? That without the chains of society, innocent children would do nothing but masterbate or have sex with adults? Emma Stone's character literally masturbates with an apple (!!!) at the dinner table.

"Poor Things","moviedays1","10 January 2024",NA,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity."
"Poor Things","awagne-29536","28 December 2023",NA,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Poor Things","pedroquintaoo","30 January 2024",NA,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."

In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
"Poor Things","SwissCheeze","3 January 2024",NA,"I wanted to like this film...but no. This film is just disturbing, and not in a good way. The film is about an INFANT who has her brain put into a woman's (the infant's mom) body. While the character may look like an adult, she is not...she is a CHILD. Let's make that clear.Immediately the child starts masturbating. Okay, uncomfortable, but maybe the director has something to say. So I stick with it. Next thing you know the child's father is offering her up to get married by his adult assistant who KNOWS that he is proposing to a child. A few scenes later Mark Ruffalo's character sneaks into her room, molests her and kidnaps her where he has rampant sex with her for several excruitatingly long scenes that span weeks if not months.It's crass and it's tasteless given that the character is a little girl with an adult woman's body, but again, while I wince, I'm assuming that it's going to all come together with some powerful social commentary that will be poignant and insightful. I'm mean, the reviews are stellar. Surely this will not be for naught...right?What is the characters big revelatory moment? She finds her agency by becoming a prostitute and - voila! - she's a complete human, a feminist at that! So essentially you have this little girl go through some seriously traumatic sexual abuse (replete with director awkwardly shows her insatiable desire for sex with adult men by having her literally beg for it constantly)...and then by ""embracing"" prostitution she is somehow magically ""liberated"" and transforms into a self-actualized being. Okay then.Not only is this some poorly thought out social commentary and character development, but it's quite warped and disturbed if you let it sink in. This just felt like some perverted guy wrapping some sordid child sex abuse fantasy with a flimsy facade of female empowerment, except that empowerment isn't earned or justified given what happens in the story. Actually, I would say quite the opposite.Add in some really heavy handed and poorly construed themes (e.g., she literally refers to her father -like figure God...really now?) and some seriously forced situational comedy and you have just an insufferable film.The only bright side for me was the art direction and costume design. All style, no substance."
"Poor Things","kjproulx","6 January 2024",NA,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever."
"Poor Things","aciessi","24 December 2023",NA,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."

"Poor Things","Pjtaylor-96-138044","23 January 2024",NA,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naive and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy)."
"Poor Things","nicolasroop","22 December 2023",NA,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
"Poor Things","reelreviewsandrecommendations","22 January 2024",NA,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"Poor Things","Lepidopterous_","8 December 2023",NA,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Poor Things","Camerenth","15 December 2023",NA,"The story is so bizarre and what occurs can only be explained as a chaos of emotions but the movie translates that into one of the best coming of age stories I have ever seen. Emma Stone is the star of this movie. She carries the movie's bizarre scenes and dives fully into the this chaotic character. The movie does not shy away from its R rating and challenges the audience on what to feel during those moments. The supporting cast is just as weird and quirky in all the best ways. Mark Ruffalo especially is almost unrecognizable from his recent roles but is a lovable stand out and is usually the centerpiece of many of the jokes of the movie. This is a must watch for its original story and beautiful world it creates."
"Poor Things","evanston_dad","19 December 2023",NA,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
"Poor Things","MattyLuke-81663","20 November 2023",NA,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
"Poor Things","imseeg","9 December 2023",NA,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
"Poor Things","UniqueParticle","29 December 2023",NA,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
"Poor Things","laurenspierre","19 October 2023",NA,"""She's like nothing you've ever seen""The same can be said for this film, which I saw at Film Fest Gent in a packed theater. It was the 5th film of the day for all of us there, but the audience was lively and exuberant. And it's no wonder, since Poor Things is nothing short of a monumental achievement: it is at once the funniest, smartest, best looking and most entertaining film of 2023. With its radical inventiveness and audacious creativity, this masterpiece may turn out to be viewed as a cinematic milestone by future generations. At the very least, Poor Things is Yorgos Lanthimos' magnum opus and deserving of instant classic status.The plot outline for Poor Things could be described as Frankenstein with a modern, feminist twist, with Godwin 'God' Baxter (William Dafoe) assuming the role of the doctor who brings Bella Baxter (Emma Stone) back from the dead. As an adult woman equipped with the brain of an infant, Bella is blessed with the intense curiosity and sense of wonder that only a newborn can have. She quickly develops a will of her own and it isn't long before she escapes her imposed confinement (shades of Lanthimos' debut film Dogtooth) by running off with smarmy lawyer Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo) on a journey of exploration of both herself and the world.I cannot say enough about the breathtaking cinematography and spectacular production design of this film, which is quite frankly atypical of what I'd had to come expect from a Lanthimos film. Not that his previous films have looked bad, but ""visually striking"" is just not what pops up first when calling to mind his films. The first act, which takes place at Dr. Baxter's mansion, is filmed in gorgeous black and white (a nod to the original Frankenstein adaptation perhaps?) and already displays some bold artistic choices, such as the frequent use of fish-eye lenses to create distorted images. But it is once Bella embarks on her adventure into the outside world that we realize we're not in Kansas anymore. Stunning visuals of luscious sets and amazing costumes in impossibly vivid colors light up the screen, as we discover an exaggeratedly artificial world through Bella's perspective, being one of childlike bewilderment.Emma Stone gives a career-defining performance as Bella Baxter. When we first meet her, Bella is less a person than a stumbling 'creature' equipped with the vocabulary of a child. Stone does an excellent job of portraying Bella's development towards becoming a 'real person', by gradually improving her grasp of language and her manner of walking, to name just a couple of things. She also convincingly sells the incredible character arc that Bella goes through during this film. It's a physically and mentally demanding role, the kind of performance they usually hand out Oscars for.William Dafoe is perfectly cast as mad scientist Godwin Baxter, who looks more like the monster of Frankenstein than the doctor that created him. Dafoe unsurprisingly does a fantastic job here, knowingly leaning into the absurdity of the story with some of his delivery, but still playing his character sincerely.A special mention has to go to Mark Ruffalo as Duncan Wedderburn here, the impossibly suave globetrotter and self-proclaimed ladykiller who brings temptation into Bella's life and takes her into the wide world. Ruffalo chews the scenery, playing Wedderburn almost as a parody of the archetypical smooth womanizer and delivering his lines with visible glee. But his histrionics actually suit the arc of his character perfectly, as he is eventually driven to utter madness by Bella's insatiable taste for sexual and intellectual exploration and the often irrefutable logic she uses to explain her actions and dismiss his complaints.However, Poor Things doesn't only overwhelm with its abundance of style and larger-than-life performances, it has something to say too. As Bella, with the voraciousness a child, develops a taste for both sexual and intellectual gratification, the film cleverly uses her unbiased perspective to ask seemingly logical questions about some of the the established gender roles and class roles she perceives in the world around her. Who would have thought that Yorgos Lanthimos, the Greek director known for his idiosyncratic style, which often expresses a cynical worldview through pitch-black, deadpan comedy, would be the one to deliver not only the most visually dazzling film of 2023, but also the most piercing critique of the patriarchy and established gender roles? (looking at you there, Barbie)Time will tell if Poor Things will be heralded as the game changer that I personally envision it to be, but at the very least we can just be happy that such a defiantly original and wonderfully creative film was made to be consumed by a mainstream audience here in 2023. As long as this kind of uniquely cinematic experience continues to exist, we can look optimistically at the future of the medium. Go see this film!"
"Poor Things","drownsoda90","22 December 2023",NA,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
"Poor Things","Xstal","14 January 2024",NA,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Poor Things","nicko252008","24 January 2024",NA,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film."
"Poor Things","jeff-gibson-835-273379","22 January 2024",NA,"High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
"Poor Things","Sleepin_Dragon","9 January 2024",NA,"Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
"Poor Things","pd-19490","20 January 2024",NA,"My previous attempts at reviewing this were declined possibly due to how I expressed my strong opinions about the movie. I will try again with as much restraint as I can and try not to insert my opinion. So here it goes. The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she still has the mind of a child. These men know she has the mind of a child and yet continue anyway. I will let you interpret that how you will. I won't watch it again. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do."
"Poor Things","rachelnstephens","1 January 2024",NA,"Pregnant woman jumps off bridge to escape her sadistic husband. Instead of dying on impact, she's dragged from the water, barely alive by a crazed doctor.The doctor decides that rather than nurse her back to health, he'll do a cesarean, and remove the mother's brain and replace it with her baby's, as her brain must have been bad if she were suicidal.The entire rest of the film is Emma Stone having sex and going full *Tropic Thunder warning* for the entire film. Full frontal nudity of both sexes throughout.The doctor's assistant agrees to marry Emma Stone (baby brain in mother's body) despite the fact she is so mentally handicapped, she can barely walk or form a complete sentence. Nevermind that's a huge breech of the duty of care between a provider and a patient, nevermind that the patient can't consent due to her disability and doesn't know what marriage even is, nevermind it's a LITERAL INFANT in an adult woman's body. Basically it's a one-sided Freaky Friday, except all Emma Stone's character wants to do is have sex non-stop.The doctor's assistant is considered the goog guy in the film, while the audience is tortured with shots of Emma Stone having predators have sex with her and then tire of her as she becomes less infantile. Emma decides to become a bisexual prostitute who then relaces her original sadistic husband's brain with that of a goat after he tries to drug her and have her clitoris removed.What is the message of this film? That without the chains of society, innocent children would do nothing but masterbate or have sex with adults? Emma Stone's character literally masturbates with an apple (!!!) at the dinner table. Why?On top of the egregious filth of a script, it's STEAMPUNK.Seriously, who wrote this script? Josh Duggar? Jimmy Saville?I don't care how nice the filming is or the costumes when this is the story. This is the worst film I've ever seen to completion. FILTH!"
"Poor Things","moviedays1","10 January 2024",NA,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity."
"Poor Things","awagne-29536","28 December 2023",NA,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Poor Things","pedroquintaoo","30 January 2024",NA,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"Poor Things","lbenot","28 December 2023",NA,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
"Poor Things","SwissCheeze","3 January 2024",NA,"I wanted to like this film...but no. This film is just disturbing, and not in a good way. The film is about an INFANT who has her brain put into a woman's (the infant's mom) body. While the character may look like an adult, she is not...she is a CHILD. Let's make that clear.Immediately the child starts masturbating. Okay, uncomfortable, but maybe the director has something to say. So I stick with it. Next thing you know the child's father is offering her up to get married by his adult assistant who KNOWS that he is proposing to a child. A few scenes later Mark Ruffalo's character sneaks into her room, molests her and kidnaps her where he has rampant sex with her for several excruitatingly long scenes that span weeks if not months.It's crass and it's tasteless given that the character is a little girl with an adult woman's body, but again, while I wince, I'm assuming that it's going to all come together with some powerful social commentary that will be poignant and insightful. I'm mean, the reviews are stellar. Surely this will not be for naught...right?What is the characters big revelatory moment? She finds her agency by becoming a prostitute and - voila! - she's a complete human, a feminist at that! So essentially you have this little girl go through some seriously traumatic sexual abuse (replete with director awkwardly shows her insatiable desire for sex with adult men by having her literally beg for it constantly)...and then by ""embracing"" prostitution she is somehow magically ""liberated"" and transforms into a self-actualized being. Okay then.Not only is this some poorly thought out social commentary and character development, but it's quite warped and disturbed if you let it sink in. This just felt like some perverted guy wrapping some sordid child sex abuse fantasy with a flimsy facade of female empowerment, except that empowerment isn't earned or justified given what happens in the story. Actually, I would say quite the opposite.Add in some really heavy handed and poorly construed themes (e.g., she literally refers to her father -like figure God...really now?) and some seriously forced situational comedy and you have just an insufferable film.The only bright side for me was the art direction and costume design. All style, no substance."
"Poor Things","kjproulx","6 January 2024",NA,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever."
"Poor Things","aciessi","24 December 2023",NA,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
"Poor Things","parksiet","31 December 2023",NA,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"Poor Things","Pjtaylor-96-138044","23 January 2024",NA,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naive and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy)."
"Poor Things","nicolasroop","22 December 2023",NA,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
"Poor Things","reelreviewsandrecommendations","22 January 2024",NA,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"Poor Things","Lepidopterous_","8 December 2023",NA,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Poor Things","Camerenth","15 December 2023",NA,"The story is so bizarre and what occurs can only be explained as a chaos of emotions but the movie translates that into one of the best coming of age stories I have ever seen. Emma Stone is the star of this movie. She carries the movie's bizarre scenes and dives fully into the this chaotic character. The movie does not shy away from its R rating and challenges the audience on what to feel during those moments. The supporting cast is just as weird and quirky in all the best ways. Mark Ruffalo especially is almost unrecognizable from his recent roles but is a lovable stand out and is usually the centerpiece of many of the jokes of the movie. This is a must watch for its original story and beautiful world it creates."
"Poor Things","evanston_dad","19 December 2023",NA,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
"Poor Things","MattyLuke-81663","20 November 2023",NA,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
"Poor Things","imseeg","9 December 2023",NA,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
"Poor Things","UniqueParticle","29 December 2023",NA,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
"Poor Things","laurenspierre","19 October 2023",NA,"""She's like nothing you've ever seen""The same can be said for this film, which I saw at Film Fest Gent in a packed theater. It was the 5th film of the day for all of us there, but the audience was lively and exuberant. And it's no wonder, since Poor Things is nothing short of a monumental achievement: it is at once the funniest, smartest, best looking and most entertaining film of 2023. With its radical inventiveness and audacious creativity, this masterpiece may turn out to be viewed as a cinematic milestone by future generations. At the very least, Poor Things is Yorgos Lanthimos' magnum opus and deserving of instant classic status.The plot outline for Poor Things could be described as Frankenstein with a modern, feminist twist, with Godwin 'God' Baxter (William Dafoe) assuming the role of the doctor who brings Bella Baxter (Emma Stone) back from the dead. As an adult woman equipped with the brain of an infant, Bella is blessed with the intense curiosity and sense of wonder that only a newborn can have. She quickly develops a will of her own and it isn't long before she escapes her imposed confinement (shades of Lanthimos' debut film Dogtooth) by running off with smarmy lawyer Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo) on a journey of exploration of both herself and the world.I cannot say enough about the breathtaking cinematography and spectacular production design of this film, which is quite frankly atypical of what I'd had to come expect from a Lanthimos film. Not that his previous films have looked bad, but ""visually striking"" is just not what pops up first when calling to mind his films. The first act, which takes place at Dr. Baxter's mansion, is filmed in gorgeous black and white (a nod to the original Frankenstein adaptation perhaps?) and already displays some bold artistic choices, such as the frequent use of fish-eye lenses to create distorted images. But it is once Bella embarks on her adventure into the outside world that we realize we're not in Kansas anymore. Stunning visuals of luscious sets and amazing costumes in impossibly vivid colors light up the screen, as we discover an exaggeratedly artificial world through Bella's perspective, being one of childlike bewilderment.Emma Stone gives a career-defining performance as Bella Baxter. When we first meet her, Bella is less a person than a stumbling 'creature' equipped with the vocabulary of a child. Stone does an excellent job of portraying Bella's development towards becoming a 'real person', by gradually improving her grasp of language and her manner of walking, to name just a couple of things. She also convincingly sells the incredible character arc that Bella goes through during this film. It's a physically and mentally demanding role, the kind of performance they usually hand out Oscars for.William Dafoe is perfectly cast as mad scientist Godwin Baxter, who looks more like the monster of Frankenstein than the doctor that created him. Dafoe unsurprisingly does a fantastic job here, knowingly leaning into the absurdity of the story with some of his delivery, but still playing his character sincerely.A special mention has to go to Mark Ruffalo as Duncan Wedderburn here, the impossibly suave globetrotter and self-proclaimed ladykiller who brings temptation into Bella's life and takes her into the wide world. Ruffalo chews the scenery, playing Wedderburn almost as a parody of the archetypical smooth womanizer and delivering his lines with visible glee. But his histrionics actually suit the arc of his character perfectly, as he is eventually driven to utter madness by Bella's insatiable taste for sexual and intellectual exploration and the often irrefutable logic she uses to explain her actions and dismiss his complaints.However, Poor Things doesn't only overwhelm with its abundance of style and larger-than-life performances, it has something to say too. As Bella, with the voraciousness a child, develops a taste for both sexual and intellectual gratification, the film cleverly uses her unbiased perspective to ask seemingly logical questions about some of the the established gender roles and class roles she perceives in the world around her. Who would have thought that Yorgos Lanthimos, the Greek director known for his idiosyncratic style, which often expresses a cynical worldview through pitch-black, deadpan comedy, would be the one to deliver not only the most visually dazzling film of 2023, but also the most piercing critique of the patriarchy and established gender roles? (looking at you there, Barbie)Time will tell if Poor Things will be heralded as the game changer that I personally envision it to be, but at the very least we can just be happy that such a defiantly original and wonderfully creative film was made to be consumed by a mainstream audience here in 2023. As long as this kind of uniquely cinematic experience continues to exist, we can look optimistically at the future of the medium. Go see this film!"
"Poor Things","drownsoda90","22 December 2023",NA,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
"Poor Things","Xstal","14 January 2024",NA,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Poor Things","nicko252008","24 January 2024",NA,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film."
"Poor Things","jeff-gibson-835-273379","22 January 2024",NA,"High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
"Poor Things","Sleepin_Dragon","9 January 2024",NA,"Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
"Poor Things","pd-19490","20 January 2024",NA,"My previous attempts at reviewing this were declined possibly due to how I expressed my strong opinions about the movie. I will try again with as much restraint as I can and try not to insert my opinion. So here it goes. The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she still has the mind of a child. These men know she has the mind of a child and yet continue anyway. I will let you interpret that how you will. I won't watch it again. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do."
"Poor Things","rachelnstephens","1 January 2024",NA,"Pregnant woman jumps off bridge to escape her sadistic husband. Instead of dying on impact, she's dragged from the water, barely alive by a crazed doctor.The doctor decides that rather than nurse her back to health, he'll do a cesarean, and remove the mother's brain and replace it with her baby's, as her brain must have been bad if she were suicidal.The entire rest of the film is Emma Stone having sex and going full *Tropic Thunder warning* for the entire film. Full frontal nudity of both sexes throughout.The doctor's assistant agrees to marry Emma Stone (baby brain in mother's body) despite the fact she is so mentally handicapped, she can barely walk or form a complete sentence. Nevermind that's a huge breech of the duty of care between a provider and a patient, nevermind that the patient can't consent due to her disability and doesn't know what marriage even is, nevermind it's a LITERAL INFANT in an adult woman's body. Basically it's a one-sided Freaky Friday, except all Emma Stone's character wants to do is have sex non-stop.The doctor's assistant is considered the goog guy in the film, while the audience is tortured with shots of Emma Stone having predators have sex with her and then tire of her as she becomes less infantile. Emma decides to become a bisexual prostitute who then relaces her original sadistic husband's brain with that of a goat after he tries to drug her and have her clitoris removed.What is the message of this film? That without the chains of society, innocent children would do nothing but masterbate or have sex with adults? Emma Stone's character literally masturbates with an apple (!!!) at the dinner table. Why?On top of the egregious filth of a script, it's STEAMPUNK.Seriously, who wrote this script? Josh Duggar? Jimmy Saville?I don't care how nice the filming is or the costumes when this is the story. This is the worst film I've ever seen to completion. FILTH!"
"Poor Things","moviedays1","10 January 2024",NA,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity."
"Poor Things","awagne-29536","28 December 2023",NA,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Poor Things","pedroquintaoo","30 January 2024",NA,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"Poor Things","lbenot","28 December 2023",NA,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
"Poor Things","SwissCheeze","3 January 2024",NA,"I wanted to like this film...but no. This film is just disturbing, and not in a good way. The film is about an INFANT who has her brain put into a woman's (the infant's mom) body. While the character may look like an adult, she is not...she is a CHILD. Let's make that clear.Immediately the child starts masturbating. Okay, uncomfortable, but maybe the director has something to say. So I stick with it. Next thing you know the child's father is offering her up to get married by his adult assistant who KNOWS that he is proposing to a child. A few scenes later Mark Ruffalo's character sneaks into her room, molests her and kidnaps her where he has rampant sex with her for several excruitatingly long scenes that span weeks if not months.It's crass and it's tasteless given that the character is a little girl with an adult woman's body, but again, while I wince, I'm assuming that it's going to all come together with some powerful social commentary that will be poignant and insightful. I'm mean, the reviews are stellar. Surely this will not be for naught...right?What is the characters big revelatory moment? She finds her agency by becoming a prostitute and - voila! - she's a complete human, a feminist at that! So essentially you have this little girl go through some seriously traumatic sexual abuse (replete with director awkwardly shows her insatiable desire for sex with adult men by having her literally beg for it constantly)...and then by ""embracing"" prostitution she is somehow magically ""liberated"" and transforms into a self-actualized being. Okay then.Not only is this some poorly thought out social commentary and character development, but it's quite warped and disturbed if you let it sink in. This just felt like some perverted guy wrapping some sordid child sex abuse fantasy with a flimsy facade of female empowerment, except that empowerment isn't earned or justified given what happens in the story. Actually, I would say quite the opposite.Add in some really heavy handed and poorly construed themes (e.g., she literally refers to her father -like figure God...really now?) and some seriously forced situational comedy and you have just an insufferable film.The only bright side for me was the art direction and costume design. All style, no substance."
"Poor Things","kjproulx","6 January 2024",NA,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever."
"Poor Things","aciessi","24 December 2023",NA,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
"Poor Things","parksiet","31 December 2023",NA,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"Poor Things","Pjtaylor-96-138044","23 January 2024",NA,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naive and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy)."
"Poor Things","nicolasroop","22 December 2023",NA,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
"Poor Things","reelreviewsandrecommendations","22 January 2024",NA,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"Poor Things","Lepidopterous_","8 December 2023",NA,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Poor Things","Camerenth","15 December 2023",NA,"The story is so bizarre and what occurs can only be explained as a chaos of emotions but the movie translates that into one of the best coming of age stories I have ever seen. Emma Stone is the star of this movie. She carries the movie's bizarre scenes and dives fully into the this chaotic character. The movie does not shy away from its R rating and challenges the audience on what to feel during those moments. The supporting cast is just as weird and quirky in all the best ways. Mark Ruffalo especially is almost unrecognizable from his recent roles but is a lovable stand out and is usually the centerpiece of many of the jokes of the movie. This is a must watch for its original story and beautiful world it creates."
"Poor Things","evanston_dad","19 December 2023",NA,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
"Poor Things","MattyLuke-81663","20 November 2023",NA,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
"Poor Things","imseeg","9 December 2023",NA,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
"Poor Things","UniqueParticle","29 December 2023",NA,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
"Poor Things","laurenspierre","19 October 2023",NA,"""She's like nothing you've ever seen""The same can be said for this film, which I saw at Film Fest Gent in a packed theater. It was the 5th film of the day for all of us there, but the audience was lively and exuberant. And it's no wonder, since Poor Things is nothing short of a monumental achievement: it is at once the funniest, smartest, best looking and most entertaining film of 2023. With its radical inventiveness and audacious creativity, this masterpiece may turn out to be viewed as a cinematic milestone by future generations. At the very least, Poor Things is Yorgos Lanthimos' magnum opus and deserving of instant classic status.The plot outline for Poor Things could be described as Frankenstein with a modern, feminist twist, with Godwin 'God' Baxter (William Dafoe) assuming the role of the doctor who brings Bella Baxter (Emma Stone) back from the dead. As an adult woman equipped with the brain of an infant, Bella is blessed with the intense curiosity and sense of wonder that only a newborn can have. She quickly develops a will of her own and it isn't long before she escapes her imposed confinement (shades of Lanthimos' debut film Dogtooth) by running off with smarmy lawyer Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo) on a journey of exploration of both herself and the world.I cannot say enough about the breathtaking cinematography and spectacular production design of this film, which is quite frankly atypical of what I'd had to come expect from a Lanthimos film. Not that his previous films have looked bad, but ""visually striking"" is just not what pops up first when calling to mind his films. The first act, which takes place at Dr. Baxter's mansion, is filmed in gorgeous black and white (a nod to the original Frankenstein adaptation perhaps?) and already displays some bold artistic choices, such as the frequent use of fish-eye lenses to create distorted images. But it is once Bella embarks on her adventure into the outside world that we realize we're not in Kansas anymore. Stunning visuals of luscious sets and amazing costumes in impossibly vivid colors light up the screen, as we discover an exaggeratedly artificial world through Bella's perspective, being one of childlike bewilderment.Emma Stone gives a career-defining performance as Bella Baxter. When we first meet her, Bella is less a person than a stumbling 'creature' equipped with the vocabulary of a child. Stone does an excellent job of portraying Bella's development towards becoming a 'real person', by gradually improving her grasp of language and her manner of walking, to name just a couple of things. She also convincingly sells the incredible character arc that Bella goes through during this film. It's a physically and mentally demanding role, the kind of performance they usually hand out Oscars for.William Dafoe is perfectly cast as mad scientist Godwin Baxter, who looks more like the monster of Frankenstein than the doctor that created him. Dafoe unsurprisingly does a fantastic job here, knowingly leaning into the absurdity of the story with some of his delivery, but still playing his character sincerely.A special mention has to go to Mark Ruffalo as Duncan Wedderburn here, the impossibly suave globetrotter and self-proclaimed ladykiller who brings temptation into Bella's life and takes her into the wide world. Ruffalo chews the scenery, playing Wedderburn almost as a parody of the archetypical smooth womanizer and delivering his lines with visible glee. But his histrionics actually suit the arc of his character perfectly, as he is eventually driven to utter madness by Bella's insatiable taste for sexual and intellectual exploration and the often irrefutable logic she uses to explain her actions and dismiss his complaints.However, Poor Things doesn't only overwhelm with its abundance of style and larger-than-life performances, it has something to say too. As Bella, with the voraciousness a child, develops a taste for both sexual and intellectual gratification, the film cleverly uses her unbiased perspective to ask seemingly logical questions about some of the the established gender roles and class roles she perceives in the world around her. Who would have thought that Yorgos Lanthimos, the Greek director known for his idiosyncratic style, which often expresses a cynical worldview through pitch-black, deadpan comedy, would be the one to deliver not only the most visually dazzling film of 2023, but also the most piercing critique of the patriarchy and established gender roles? (looking at you there, Barbie)Time will tell if Poor Things will be heralded as the game changer that I personally envision it to be, but at the very least we can just be happy that such a defiantly original and wonderfully creative film was made to be consumed by a mainstream audience here in 2023. As long as this kind of uniquely cinematic experience continues to exist, we can look optimistically at the future of the medium. Go see this film!"
"Poor Things","drownsoda90","22 December 2023",NA,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."

He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Poor Things","nicko252008","24 January 2024",NA,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film."

Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years.

I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."

I will try again with as much restraint as I can and try not to insert my opinion. So here it goes. The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she still has the mind of a child. These men know she has the mind of a child and yet continue anyway. I will let you interpret that how you will. I won't watch it again. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do."

Full frontal nudity of both sexes throughout.The doctor's assistant agrees to marry Emma Stone (baby brain in mother's body) despite the fact she is so mentally handicapped, she can barely walk or form a complete sentence. Nevermind that's a huge breech of the duty of care between a provider and a patient, nevermind that the patient can't consent due to her disability and doesn't know what marriage even is, nevermind it's a LITERAL INFANT in an adult woman's body. Basically it's a one-sided Freaky Friday, except all Emma Stone's character wants to do is have sex non-stop.The doctor's assistant is considered the goog guy in the film, while the audience is tortured with shots of Emma Stone having predators have sex with her and then tire of her as she becomes less infantile. Emma decides to become a bisexual prostitute who then relaces her original sadistic husband's brain with that of a goat after he tries to drug her and have her clitoris removed.What is the message of this film? That without the chains of society, innocent children would do nothing but masterbate or have sex with adults? Emma Stone's character literally masturbates with an apple (!!!) at the dinner table.

"Poor Things","moviedays1","10 January 2024",NA,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity."
"Poor Things","awagne-29536","28 December 2023",NA,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Poor Things","pedroquintaoo","30 January 2024",NA,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."

In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
"Poor Things","SwissCheeze","3 January 2024",NA,"I wanted to like this film...but no. This film is just disturbing, and not in a good way. The film is about an INFANT who has her brain put into a woman's (the infant's mom) body. While the character may look like an adult, she is not...she is a CHILD. Let's make that clear.Immediately the child starts masturbating. Okay, uncomfortable, but maybe the director has something to say. So I stick with it. Next thing you know the child's father is offering her up to get married by his adult assistant who KNOWS that he is proposing to a child. A few scenes later Mark Ruffalo's character sneaks into her room, molests her and kidnaps her where he has rampant sex with her for several excruitatingly long scenes that span weeks if not months.It's crass and it's tasteless given that the character is a little girl with an adult woman's body, but again, while I wince, I'm assuming that it's going to all come together with some powerful social commentary that will be poignant and insightful. I'm mean, the reviews are stellar. Surely this will not be for naught...right?What is the characters big revelatory moment? She finds her agency by becoming a prostitute and - voila! - she's a complete human, a feminist at that! So essentially you have this little girl go through some seriously traumatic sexual abuse (replete with director awkwardly shows her insatiable desire for sex with adult men by having her literally beg for it constantly)...and then by ""embracing"" prostitution she is somehow magically ""liberated"" and transforms into a self-actualized being. Okay then.Not only is this some poorly thought out social commentary and character development, but it's quite warped and disturbed if you let it sink in. This just felt like some perverted guy wrapping some sordid child sex abuse fantasy with a flimsy facade of female empowerment, except that empowerment isn't earned or justified given what happens in the story. Actually, I would say quite the opposite.Add in some really heavy handed and poorly construed themes (e.g., she literally refers to her father -like figure God...really now?) and some seriously forced situational comedy and you have just an insufferable film.The only bright side for me was the art direction and costume design. All style, no substance."
"Poor Things","kjproulx","6 January 2024",NA,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever."
"Poor Things","aciessi","24 December 2023",NA,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."

And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"Poor Things","Pjtaylor-96-138044","23 January 2024",NA,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naive and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy)."
"Poor Things","nicolasroop","22 December 2023",NA,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
"Poor Things","reelreviewsandrecommendations","22 January 2024",NA,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"Poor Things","Lepidopterous_","8 December 2023",NA,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Poor Things","Camerenth","15 December 2023",NA,"The story is so bizarre and what occurs can only be explained as a chaos of emotions but the movie translates that into one of the best coming of age stories I have ever seen. Emma Stone is the star of this movie. She carries the movie's bizarre scenes and dives fully into the this chaotic character. The movie does not shy away from its R rating and challenges the audience on what to feel during those moments. The supporting cast is just as weird and quirky in all the best ways. Mark Ruffalo especially is almost unrecognizable from his recent roles but is a lovable stand out and is usually the centerpiece of many of the jokes of the movie. This is a must watch for its original story and beautiful world it creates."
"Poor Things","evanston_dad","19 December 2023",NA,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
"Poor Things","MattyLuke-81663","20 November 2023",NA,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
"Poor Things","imseeg","9 December 2023",NA,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
"Poor Things","UniqueParticle","29 December 2023",NA,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
"Poor Things","laurenspierre","19 October 2023",NA,"""She's like nothing you've ever seen""The same can be said for this film, which I saw at Film Fest Gent in a packed theater. It was the 5th film of the day for all of us there, but the audience was lively and exuberant. And it's no wonder, since Poor Things is nothing short of a monumental achievement: it is at once the funniest, smartest, best looking and most entertaining film of 2023. With its radical inventiveness and audacious creativity, this masterpiece may turn out to be viewed as a cinematic milestone by future generations. At the very least, Poor Things is Yorgos Lanthimos' magnum opus and deserving of instant classic status.The plot outline for Poor Things could be described as Frankenstein with a modern, feminist twist, with Godwin 'God' Baxter (William Dafoe) assuming the role of the doctor who brings Bella Baxter (Emma Stone) back from the dead. As an adult woman equipped with the brain of an infant, Bella is blessed with the intense curiosity and sense of wonder that only a newborn can have. She quickly develops a will of her own and it isn't long before she escapes her imposed confinement (shades of Lanthimos' debut film Dogtooth) by running off with smarmy lawyer Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo) on a journey of exploration of both herself and the world.I cannot say enough about the breathtaking cinematography and spectacular production design of this film, which is quite frankly atypical of what I'd had to come expect from a Lanthimos film. Not that his previous films have looked bad, but ""visually striking"" is just not what pops up first when calling to mind his films. The first act, which takes place at Dr. Baxter's mansion, is filmed in gorgeous black and white (a nod to the original Frankenstein adaptation perhaps?) and already displays some bold artistic choices, such as the frequent use of fish-eye lenses to create distorted images. But it is once Bella embarks on her adventure into the outside world that we realize we're not in Kansas anymore. Stunning visuals of luscious sets and amazing costumes in impossibly vivid colors light up the screen, as we discover an exaggeratedly artificial world through Bella's perspective, being one of childlike bewilderment.Emma Stone gives a career-defining performance as Bella Baxter. When we first meet her, Bella is less a person than a stumbling 'creature' equipped with the vocabulary of a child. Stone does an excellent job of portraying Bella's development towards becoming a 'real person', by gradually improving her grasp of language and her manner of walking, to name just a couple of things. She also convincingly sells the incredible character arc that Bella goes through during this film. It's a physically and mentally demanding role, the kind of performance they usually hand out Oscars for.William Dafoe is perfectly cast as mad scientist Godwin Baxter, who looks more like the monster of Frankenstein than the doctor that created him. Dafoe unsurprisingly does a fantastic job here, knowingly leaning into the absurdity of the story with some of his delivery, but still playing his character sincerely.A special mention has to go to Mark Ruffalo as Duncan Wedderburn here, the impossibly suave globetrotter and self-proclaimed ladykiller who brings temptation into Bella's life and takes her into the wide world. Ruffalo chews the scenery, playing Wedderburn almost as a parody of the archetypical smooth womanizer and delivering his lines with visible glee. But his histrionics actually suit the arc of his character perfectly, as he is eventually driven to utter madness by Bella's insatiable taste for sexual and intellectual exploration and the often irrefutable logic she uses to explain her actions and dismiss his complaints.However, Poor Things doesn't only overwhelm with its abundance of style and larger-than-life performances, it has something to say too. As Bella, with the voraciousness a child, develops a taste for both sexual and intellectual gratification, the film cleverly uses her unbiased perspective to ask seemingly logical questions about some of the the established gender roles and class roles she perceives in the world around her. Who would have thought that Yorgos Lanthimos, the Greek director known for his idiosyncratic style, which often expresses a cynical worldview through pitch-black, deadpan comedy, would be the one to deliver not only the most visually dazzling film of 2023, but also the most piercing critique of the patriarchy and established gender roles? (looking at you there, Barbie)Time will tell if Poor Things will be heralded as the game changer that I personally envision it to be, but at the very least we can just be happy that such a defiantly original and wonderfully creative film was made to be consumed by a mainstream audience here in 2023. As long as this kind of uniquely cinematic experience continues to exist, we can look optimistically at the future of the medium. Go see this film!"
"Poor Things","drownsoda90","22 December 2023",NA,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
"Poor Things","Xstal","14 January 2024",NA,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Poor Things","nicko252008","24 January 2024",NA,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film."
"Poor Things","jeff-gibson-835-273379","22 January 2024",NA,"High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"

I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
"Poor Things","pd-19490","20 January 2024",NA,"My previous attempts at reviewing this were declined possibly due to how I expressed my strong opinions about the movie. I will try again with as much restraint as I can and try not to insert my opinion. So here it goes. The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she still has the mind of a child. These men know she has the mind of a child and yet continue anyway. I will let you interpret that how you will. I won't watch it again. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do."

Full frontal nudity of both sexes throughout.The doctor's assistant agrees to marry Emma Stone (baby brain in mother's body) despite the fact she is so mentally handicapped, she can barely walk or form a complete sentence. Nevermind that's a huge breech of the duty of care between a provider and a patient, nevermind that the patient can't consent due to her disability and doesn't know what marriage even is, nevermind it's a LITERAL INFANT in an adult woman's body. Basically it's a one-sided Freaky Friday, except all Emma Stone's character wants to do is have sex non-stop.The doctor's assistant is considered the goog guy in the film, while the audience is tortured with shots of Emma Stone having predators have sex with her and then tire of her as she becomes less infantile. Emma decides to become a bisexual prostitute who then relaces her original sadistic husband's brain with that of a goat after he tries to drug her and have her clitoris removed.What is the message of this film? That without the chains of society, innocent children would do nothing but masterbate or have sex with adults? Emma Stone's character literally masturbates with an apple (!!!) at the dinner table.

"Poor Things","moviedays1","10 January 2024",NA,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity."

Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Poor Things","pedroquintaoo","30 January 2024",NA,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."

"Poor Things","SwissCheeze","3 January 2024",NA,"I wanted to like this film...but no. This film is just disturbing, and not in a good way. The film is about an INFANT who has her brain put into a woman's (the infant's mom) body. While the character may look like an adult, she is not...she is a CHILD. Let's make that clear.Immediately the child starts masturbating. Okay, uncomfortable, but maybe the director has something to say. So I stick with it. Next thing you know the child's father is offering her up to get married by his adult assistant who KNOWS that he is proposing to a child. A few scenes later Mark Ruffalo's character sneaks into her room, molests her and kidnaps her where he has rampant sex with her for several excruitatingly long scenes that span weeks if not months.It's crass and it's tasteless given that the character is a little girl with an adult woman's body, but again, while I wince, I'm assuming that it's going to all come together with some powerful social commentary that will be poignant and insightful. I'm mean, the reviews are stellar. Surely this will not be for naught...right?What is the characters big revelatory moment? She finds her agency by becoming a prostitute and - voila! - she's a complete human, a feminist at that! So essentially you have this little girl go through some seriously traumatic sexual abuse (replete with director awkwardly shows her insatiable desire for sex with adult men by having her literally beg for it constantly)...and then by ""embracing"" prostitution she is somehow magically ""liberated"" and transforms into a self-actualized being. Okay then.Not only is this some poorly thought out social commentary and character development, but it's quite warped and disturbed if you let it sink in. This just felt like some perverted guy wrapping some sordid child sex abuse fantasy with a flimsy facade of female empowerment, except that empowerment isn't earned or justified given what happens in the story. Actually, I would say quite the opposite.Add in some really heavy handed and poorly construed themes (e.g., she literally refers to her father -like figure God...really now?) and some seriously forced situational comedy and you have just an insufferable film.The only bright side for me was the art direction and costume design. All style, no substance."
"Poor Things","kjproulx","6 January 2024",NA,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever."
"Poor Things","aciessi","24 December 2023",NA,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
"Poor Things","parksiet","31 December 2023",NA,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"Poor Things","Pjtaylor-96-138044","23 January 2024",NA,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naive and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy)."
"Poor Things","nicolasroop","22 December 2023",NA,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
"Poor Things","reelreviewsandrecommendations","22 January 2024",NA,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"Poor Things","Lepidopterous_","8 December 2023",NA,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Poor Things","Camerenth","15 December 2023",NA,"The story is so bizarre and what occurs can only be explained as a chaos of emotions but the movie translates that into one of the best coming of age stories I have ever seen. Emma Stone is the star of this movie. She carries the movie's bizarre scenes and dives fully into the this chaotic character. The movie does not shy away from its R rating and challenges the audience on what to feel during those moments. The supporting cast is just as weird and quirky in all the best ways. Mark Ruffalo especially is almost unrecognizable from his recent roles but is a lovable stand out and is usually the centerpiece of many of the jokes of the movie. This is a must watch for its original story and beautiful world it creates."
"Poor Things","evanston_dad","19 December 2023",NA,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
"Poor Things","MattyLuke-81663","20 November 2023",NA,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
"Poor Things","imseeg","9 December 2023",NA,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."

Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
"Poor Things","laurenspierre","19 October 2023",NA,"""She's like nothing you've ever seen""The same can be said for this film, which I saw at Film Fest Gent in a packed theater. It was the 5th film of the day for all of us there, but the audience was lively and exuberant. And it's no wonder, since Poor Things is nothing short of a monumental achievement: it is at once the funniest, smartest, best looking and most entertaining film of 2023. With its radical inventiveness and audacious creativity, this masterpiece may turn out to be viewed as a cinematic milestone by future generations. At the very least, Poor Things is Yorgos Lanthimos' magnum opus and deserving of instant classic status.The plot outline for Poor Things could be described as Frankenstein with a modern, feminist twist, with Godwin 'God' Baxter (William Dafoe) assuming the role of the doctor who brings Bella Baxter (Emma Stone) back from the dead. As an adult woman equipped with the brain of an infant, Bella is blessed with the intense curiosity and sense of wonder that only a newborn can have. She quickly develops a will of her own and it isn't long before she escapes her imposed confinement (shades of Lanthimos' debut film Dogtooth) by running off with smarmy lawyer Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo) on a journey of exploration of both herself and the world.I cannot say enough about the breathtaking cinematography and spectacular production design of this film, which is quite frankly atypical of what I'd had to come expect from a Lanthimos film. Not that his previous films have looked bad, but ""visually striking"" is just not what pops up first when calling to mind his films. The first act, which takes place at Dr. Baxter's mansion, is filmed in gorgeous black and white (a nod to the original Frankenstein adaptation perhaps?) and already displays some bold artistic choices, such as the frequent use of fish-eye lenses to create distorted images. But it is once Bella embarks on her adventure into the outside world that we realize we're not in Kansas anymore. Stunning visuals of luscious sets and amazing costumes in impossibly vivid colors light up the screen, as we discover an exaggeratedly artificial world through Bella's perspective, being one of childlike bewilderment.Emma Stone gives a career-defining performance as Bella Baxter. When we first meet her, Bella is less a person than a stumbling 'creature' equipped with the vocabulary of a child. Stone does an excellent job of portraying Bella's development towards becoming a 'real person', by gradually improving her grasp of language and her manner of walking, to name just a couple of things. She also convincingly sells the incredible character arc that Bella goes through during this film. It's a physically and mentally demanding role, the kind of performance they usually hand out Oscars for.William Dafoe is perfectly cast as mad scientist Godwin Baxter, who looks more like the monster of Frankenstein than the doctor that created him. Dafoe unsurprisingly does a fantastic job here, knowingly leaning into the absurdity of the story with some of his delivery, but still playing his character sincerely.A special mention has to go to Mark Ruffalo as Duncan Wedderburn here, the impossibly suave globetrotter and self-proclaimed ladykiller who brings temptation into Bella's life and takes her into the wide world. Ruffalo chews the scenery, playing Wedderburn almost as a parody of the archetypical smooth womanizer and delivering his lines with visible glee. But his histrionics actually suit the arc of his character perfectly, as he is eventually driven to utter madness by Bella's insatiable taste for sexual and intellectual exploration and the often irrefutable logic she uses to explain her actions and dismiss his complaints.However, Poor Things doesn't only overwhelm with its abundance of style and larger-than-life performances, it has something to say too. As Bella, with the voraciousness a child, develops a taste for both sexual and intellectual gratification, the film cleverly uses her unbiased perspective to ask seemingly logical questions about some of the the established gender roles and class roles she perceives in the world around her. Who would have thought that Yorgos Lanthimos, the Greek director known for his idiosyncratic style, which often expresses a cynical worldview through pitch-black, deadpan comedy, would be the one to deliver not only the most visually dazzling film of 2023, but also the most piercing critique of the patriarchy and established gender roles? (looking at you there, Barbie)Time will tell if Poor Things will be heralded as the game changer that I personally envision it to be, but at the very least we can just be happy that such a defiantly original and wonderfully creative film was made to be consumed by a mainstream audience here in 2023. As long as this kind of uniquely cinematic experience continues to exist, we can look optimistically at the future of the medium. Go see this film!"
"Poor Things","drownsoda90","22 December 2023",NA,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
"Poor Things","Xstal","14 January 2024",NA,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Poor Things","nicko252008","24 January 2024",NA,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film."
"Poor Things","jeff-gibson-835-273379","22 January 2024",NA,"High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
"Poor Things","Sleepin_Dragon","9 January 2024",NA,"Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
"Poor Things","pd-19490","20 January 2024",NA,"My previous attempts at reviewing this were declined possibly due to how I expressed my strong opinions about the movie. I will try again with as much restraint as I can and try not to insert my opinion. So here it goes. The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she still has the mind of a child. These men know she has the mind of a child and yet continue anyway. I will let you interpret that how you will. I won't watch it again. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do."
"Poor Things","rachelnstephens","1 January 2024",NA,"Pregnant woman jumps off bridge to escape her sadistic husband. Instead of dying on impact, she's dragged from the water, barely alive by a crazed doctor.The doctor decides that rather than nurse her back to health, he'll do a cesarean, and remove the mother's brain and replace it with her baby's, as her brain must have been bad if she were suicidal.The entire rest of the film is Emma Stone having sex and going full *Tropic Thunder warning* for the entire film. Full frontal nudity of both sexes throughout.The doctor's assistant agrees to marry Emma Stone (baby brain in mother's body) despite the fact she is so mentally handicapped, she can barely walk or form a complete sentence. Nevermind that's a huge breech of the duty of care between a provider and a patient, nevermind that the patient can't consent due to her disability and doesn't know what marriage even is, nevermind it's a LITERAL INFANT in an adult woman's body. Basically it's a one-sided Freaky Friday, except all Emma Stone's character wants to do is have sex non-stop.The doctor's assistant is considered the goog guy in the film, while the audience is tortured with shots of Emma Stone having predators have sex with her and then tire of her as she becomes less infantile. Emma decides to become a bisexual prostitute who then relaces her original sadistic husband's brain with that of a goat after he tries to drug her and have her clitoris removed.What is the message of this film? That without the chains of society, innocent children would do nothing but masterbate or have sex with adults? Emma Stone's character literally masturbates with an apple (!!!) at the dinner table. Why?On top of the egregious filth of a script, it's STEAMPUNK.Seriously, who wrote this script? Josh Duggar? Jimmy Saville?I don't care how nice the filming is or the costumes when this is the story. This is the worst film I've ever seen to completion. FILTH!"
"Poor Things","moviedays1","10 January 2024",NA,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity."
"Poor Things","awagne-29536","28 December 2023",NA,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Poor Things","pedroquintaoo","30 January 2024",NA,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"Poor Things","lbenot","28 December 2023",NA,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
"Poor Things","SwissCheeze","3 January 2024",NA,"I wanted to like this film...but no. This film is just disturbing, and not in a good way. The film is about an INFANT who has her brain put into a woman's (the infant's mom) body. While the character may look like an adult, she is not...she is a CHILD. Let's make that clear.Immediately the child starts masturbating. Okay, uncomfortable, but maybe the director has something to say. So I stick with it. Next thing you know the child's father is offering her up to get married by his adult assistant who KNOWS that he is proposing to a child. A few scenes later Mark Ruffalo's character sneaks into her room, molests her and kidnaps her where he has rampant sex with her for several excruitatingly long scenes that span weeks if not months.It's crass and it's tasteless given that the character is a little girl with an adult woman's body, but again, while I wince, I'm assuming that it's going to all come together with some powerful social commentary that will be poignant and insightful. I'm mean, the reviews are stellar. Surely this will not be for naught...right?What is the characters big revelatory moment? She finds her agency by becoming a prostitute and - voila! - she's a complete human, a feminist at that! So essentially you have this little girl go through some seriously traumatic sexual abuse (replete with director awkwardly shows her insatiable desire for sex with adult men by having her literally beg for it constantly)...and then by ""embracing"" prostitution she is somehow magically ""liberated"" and transforms into a self-actualized being. Okay then.Not only is this some poorly thought out social commentary and character development, but it's quite warped and disturbed if you let it sink in. This just felt like some perverted guy wrapping some sordid child sex abuse fantasy with a flimsy facade of female empowerment, except that empowerment isn't earned or justified given what happens in the story. Actually, I would say quite the opposite.Add in some really heavy handed and poorly construed themes (e.g., she literally refers to her father -like figure God...really now?) and some seriously forced situational comedy and you have just an insufferable film.The only bright side for me was the art direction and costume design. All style, no substance."
"Poor Things","kjproulx","6 January 2024",NA,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever."
"Poor Things","aciessi","24 December 2023",NA,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."

And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"Poor Things","Pjtaylor-96-138044","23 January 2024",NA,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naive and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy)."
"Poor Things","nicolasroop","22 December 2023",NA,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
"Poor Things","reelreviewsandrecommendations","22 January 2024",NA,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"Poor Things","Lepidopterous_","8 December 2023",NA,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Poor Things","Camerenth","15 December 2023",NA,"The story is so bizarre and what occurs can only be explained as a chaos of emotions but the movie translates that into one of the best coming of age stories I have ever seen. Emma Stone is the star of this movie. She carries the movie's bizarre scenes and dives fully into the this chaotic character. The movie does not shy away from its R rating and challenges the audience on what to feel during those moments. The supporting cast is just as weird and quirky in all the best ways. Mark Ruffalo especially is almost unrecognizable from his recent roles but is a lovable stand out and is usually the centerpiece of many of the jokes of the movie. This is a must watch for its original story and beautiful world it creates."
"Poor Things","evanston_dad","19 December 2023",NA,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
"Poor Things","MattyLuke-81663","20 November 2023",NA,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
"Poor Things","imseeg","9 December 2023",NA,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
"Poor Things","UniqueParticle","29 December 2023",NA,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
"Poor Things","laurenspierre","19 October 2023",NA,"""She's like nothing you've ever seen""The same can be said for this film, which I saw at Film Fest Gent in a packed theater. It was the 5th film of the day for all of us there, but the audience was lively and exuberant. And it's no wonder, since Poor Things is nothing short of a monumental achievement: it is at once the funniest, smartest, best looking and most entertaining film of 2023. With its radical inventiveness and audacious creativity, this masterpiece may turn out to be viewed as a cinematic milestone by future generations. At the very least, Poor Things is Yorgos Lanthimos' magnum opus and deserving of instant classic status.The plot outline for Poor Things could be described as Frankenstein with a modern, feminist twist, with Godwin 'God' Baxter (William Dafoe) assuming the role of the doctor who brings Bella Baxter (Emma Stone) back from the dead. As an adult woman equipped with the brain of an infant, Bella is blessed with the intense curiosity and sense of wonder that only a newborn can have. She quickly develops a will of her own and it isn't long before she escapes her imposed confinement (shades of Lanthimos' debut film Dogtooth) by running off with smarmy lawyer Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo) on a journey of exploration of both herself and the world.I cannot say enough about the breathtaking cinematography and spectacular production design of this film, which is quite frankly atypical of what I'd had to come expect from a Lanthimos film. Not that his previous films have looked bad, but ""visually striking"" is just not what pops up first when calling to mind his films. The first act, which takes place at Dr. Baxter's mansion, is filmed in gorgeous black and white (a nod to the original Frankenstein adaptation perhaps?) and already displays some bold artistic choices, such as the frequent use of fish-eye lenses to create distorted images. But it is once Bella embarks on her adventure into the outside world that we realize we're not in Kansas anymore. Stunning visuals of luscious sets and amazing costumes in impossibly vivid colors light up the screen, as we discover an exaggeratedly artificial world through Bella's perspective, being one of childlike bewilderment.Emma Stone gives a career-defining performance as Bella Baxter. When we first meet her, Bella is less a person than a stumbling 'creature' equipped with the vocabulary of a child. Stone does an excellent job of portraying Bella's development towards becoming a 'real person', by gradually improving her grasp of language and her manner of walking, to name just a couple of things. She also convincingly sells the incredible character arc that Bella goes through during this film. It's a physically and mentally demanding role, the kind of performance they usually hand out Oscars for.William Dafoe is perfectly cast as mad scientist Godwin Baxter, who looks more like the monster of Frankenstein than the doctor that created him. Dafoe unsurprisingly does a fantastic job here, knowingly leaning into the absurdity of the story with some of his delivery, but still playing his character sincerely.A special mention has to go to Mark Ruffalo as Duncan Wedderburn here, the impossibly suave globetrotter and self-proclaimed ladykiller who brings temptation into Bella's life and takes her into the wide world. Ruffalo chews the scenery, playing Wedderburn almost as a parody of the archetypical smooth womanizer and delivering his lines with visible glee. But his histrionics actually suit the arc of his character perfectly, as he is eventually driven to utter madness by Bella's insatiable taste for sexual and intellectual exploration and the often irrefutable logic she uses to explain her actions and dismiss his complaints.However, Poor Things doesn't only overwhelm with its abundance of style and larger-than-life performances, it has something to say too. As Bella, with the voraciousness a child, develops a taste for both sexual and intellectual gratification, the film cleverly uses her unbiased perspective to ask seemingly logical questions about some of the the established gender roles and class roles she perceives in the world around her. Who would have thought that Yorgos Lanthimos, the Greek director known for his idiosyncratic style, which often expresses a cynical worldview through pitch-black, deadpan comedy, would be the one to deliver not only the most visually dazzling film of 2023, but also the most piercing critique of the patriarchy and established gender roles? (looking at you there, Barbie)Time will tell if Poor Things will be heralded as the game changer that I personally envision it to be, but at the very least we can just be happy that such a defiantly original and wonderfully creative film was made to be consumed by a mainstream audience here in 2023. As long as this kind of uniquely cinematic experience continues to exist, we can look optimistically at the future of the medium. Go see this film!"
"Poor Things","drownsoda90","22 December 2023",NA,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
"Poor Things","Xstal","14 January 2024",NA,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Poor Things","nicko252008","24 January 2024",NA,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film."
"Poor Things","jeff-gibson-835-273379","22 January 2024",NA,"High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years.

I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."

I will try again with as much restraint as I can and try not to insert my opinion. So here it goes. The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she still has the mind of a child. These men know she has the mind of a child and yet continue anyway. I will let you interpret that how you will. I won't watch it again. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do."

Full frontal nudity of both sexes throughout.The doctor's assistant agrees to marry Emma Stone (baby brain in mother's body) despite the fact she is so mentally handicapped, she can barely walk or form a complete sentence. Nevermind that's a huge breech of the duty of care between a provider and a patient, nevermind that the patient can't consent due to her disability and doesn't know what marriage even is, nevermind it's a LITERAL INFANT in an adult woman's body. Basically it's a one-sided Freaky Friday, except all Emma Stone's character wants to do is have sex non-stop.The doctor's assistant is considered the goog guy in the film, while the audience is tortured with shots of Emma Stone having predators have sex with her and then tire of her as she becomes less infantile. Emma decides to become a bisexual prostitute who then relaces her original sadistic husband's brain with that of a goat after he tries to drug her and have her clitoris removed.What is the message of this film?

I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity."
"Poor Things","awagne-29536","28 December 2023",NA,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Poor Things","pedroquintaoo","30 January 2024",NA,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"Poor Things","lbenot","28 December 2023",NA,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
"Poor Things","SwissCheeze","3 January 2024",NA,"I wanted to like this film...but no. This film is just disturbing, and not in a good way. The film is about an INFANT who has her brain put into a woman's (the infant's mom) body. While the character may look like an adult, she is not...she is a CHILD. Let's make that clear.Immediately the child starts masturbating. Okay, uncomfortable, but maybe the director has something to say. So I stick with it. Next thing you know the child's father is offering her up to get married by his adult assistant who KNOWS that he is proposing to a child. A few scenes later Mark Ruffalo's character sneaks into her room, molests her and kidnaps her where he has rampant sex with her for several excruitatingly long scenes that span weeks if not months.It's crass and it's tasteless given that the character is a little girl with an adult woman's body, but again, while I wince, I'm assuming that it's going to all come together with some powerful social commentary that will be poignant and insightful. I'm mean, the reviews are stellar. Surely this will not be for naught...right?What is the characters big revelatory moment? She finds her agency by becoming a prostitute and - voila! - she's a complete human, a feminist at that! So essentially you have this little girl go through some seriously traumatic sexual abuse (replete with director awkwardly shows her insatiable desire for sex with adult men by having her literally beg for it constantly)...and then by ""embracing"" prostitution she is somehow magically ""liberated"" and transforms into a self-actualized being. Okay then.Not only is this some poorly thought out social commentary and character development, but it's quite warped and disturbed if you let it sink in. This just felt like some perverted guy wrapping some sordid child sex abuse fantasy with a flimsy facade of female empowerment, except that empowerment isn't earned or justified given what happens in the story. Actually, I would say quite the opposite.Add in some really heavy handed and poorly construed themes (e.g., she literally refers to her father -like figure God...really now?) and some seriously forced situational comedy and you have just an insufferable film.The only bright side for me was the art direction and costume design. All style, no substance."
"Poor Things","kjproulx","6 January 2024",NA,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever."
"Poor Things","aciessi","24 December 2023",NA,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
"Poor Things","parksiet","31 December 2023",NA,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"Poor Things","Pjtaylor-96-138044","23 January 2024",NA,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naive and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy)."
"Poor Things","nicolasroop","22 December 2023",NA,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
"Poor Things","reelreviewsandrecommendations","22 January 2024",NA,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"Poor Things","Lepidopterous_","8 December 2023",NA,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Poor Things","Camerenth","15 December 2023",NA,"The story is so bizarre and what occurs can only be explained as a chaos of emotions but the movie translates that into one of the best coming of age stories I have ever seen. Emma Stone is the star of this movie. She carries the movie's bizarre scenes and dives fully into the this chaotic character. The movie does not shy away from its R rating and challenges the audience on what to feel during those moments. The supporting cast is just as weird and quirky in all the best ways. Mark Ruffalo especially is almost unrecognizable from his recent roles but is a lovable stand out and is usually the centerpiece of many of the jokes of the movie. This is a must watch for its original story and beautiful world it creates."
"Poor Things","evanston_dad","19 December 2023",NA,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
"Poor Things","MattyLuke-81663","20 November 2023",NA,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
"Poor Things","imseeg","9 December 2023",NA,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
"Poor Things","UniqueParticle","29 December 2023",NA,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
"Poor Things","laurenspierre","19 October 2023",NA,"""She's like nothing you've ever seen""The same can be said for this film, which I saw at Film Fest Gent in a packed theater. It was the 5th film of the day for all of us there, but the audience was lively and exuberant. And it's no wonder, since Poor Things is nothing short of a monumental achievement: it is at once the funniest, smartest, best looking and most entertaining film of 2023. With its radical inventiveness and audacious creativity, this masterpiece may turn out to be viewed as a cinematic milestone by future generations. At the very least, Poor Things is Yorgos Lanthimos' magnum opus and deserving of instant classic status.The plot outline for Poor Things could be described as Frankenstein with a modern, feminist twist, with Godwin 'God' Baxter (William Dafoe) assuming the role of the doctor who brings Bella Baxter (Emma Stone) back from the dead. As an adult woman equipped with the brain of an infant, Bella is blessed with the intense curiosity and sense of wonder that only a newborn can have. She quickly develops a will of her own and it isn't long before she escapes her imposed confinement (shades of Lanthimos' debut film Dogtooth) by running off with smarmy lawyer Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo) on a journey of exploration of both herself and the world.I cannot say enough about the breathtaking cinematography and spectacular production design of this film, which is quite frankly atypical of what I'd had to come expect from a Lanthimos film. Not that his previous films have looked bad, but ""visually striking"" is just not what pops up first when calling to mind his films. The first act, which takes place at Dr. Baxter's mansion, is filmed in gorgeous black and white (a nod to the original Frankenstein adaptation perhaps?) and already displays some bold artistic choices, such as the frequent use of fish-eye lenses to create distorted images. But it is once Bella embarks on her adventure into the outside world that we realize we're not in Kansas anymore. Stunning visuals of luscious sets and amazing costumes in impossibly vivid colors light up the screen, as we discover an exaggeratedly artificial world through Bella's perspective, being one of childlike bewilderment.Emma Stone gives a career-defining performance as Bella Baxter. When we first meet her, Bella is less a person than a stumbling 'creature' equipped with the vocabulary of a child. Stone does an excellent job of portraying Bella's development towards becoming a 'real person', by gradually improving her grasp of language and her manner of walking, to name just a couple of things. She also convincingly sells the incredible character arc that Bella goes through during this film. It's a physically and mentally demanding role, the kind of performance they usually hand out Oscars for.William Dafoe is perfectly cast as mad scientist Godwin Baxter, who looks more like the monster of Frankenstein than the doctor that created him. Dafoe unsurprisingly does a fantastic job here, knowingly leaning into the absurdity of the story with some of his delivery, but still playing his character sincerely.A special mention has to go to Mark Ruffalo as Duncan Wedderburn here, the impossibly suave globetrotter and self-proclaimed ladykiller who brings temptation into Bella's life and takes her into the wide world. Ruffalo chews the scenery, playing Wedderburn almost as a parody of the archetypical smooth womanizer and delivering his lines with visible glee. But his histrionics actually suit the arc of his character perfectly, as he is eventually driven to utter madness by Bella's insatiable taste for sexual and intellectual exploration and the often irrefutable logic she uses to explain her actions and dismiss his complaints.However, Poor Things doesn't only overwhelm with its abundance of style and larger-than-life performances, it has something to say too. As Bella, with the voraciousness a child, develops a taste for both sexual and intellectual gratification, the film cleverly uses her unbiased perspective to ask seemingly logical questions about some of the the established gender roles and class roles she perceives in the world around her. Who would have thought that Yorgos Lanthimos, the Greek director known for his idiosyncratic style, which often expresses a cynical worldview through pitch-black, deadpan comedy, would be the one to deliver not only the most visually dazzling film of 2023, but also the most piercing critique of the patriarchy and established gender roles? (looking at you there, Barbie)Time will tell if Poor Things will be heralded as the game changer that I personally envision it to be, but at the very least we can just be happy that such a defiantly original and wonderfully creative film was made to be consumed by a mainstream audience here in 2023. As long as this kind of uniquely cinematic experience continues to exist, we can look optimistically at the future of the medium. Go see this film!"
"Poor Things","drownsoda90","22 December 2023",NA,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
"Poor Things","Xstal","14 January 2024",NA,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Poor Things","nicko252008","24 January 2024",NA,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film."
"Poor Things","jeff-gibson-835-273379","22 January 2024",NA,"High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"

I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
"Poor Things","pd-19490","20 January 2024",NA,"My previous attempts at reviewing this were declined possibly due to how I expressed my strong opinions about the movie. I will try again with as much restraint as I can and try not to insert my opinion. So here it goes. The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she still has the mind of a child. These men know she has the mind of a child and yet continue anyway. I will let you interpret that how you will. I won't watch it again. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do."
"Poor Things","rachelnstephens","1 January 2024",NA,"Pregnant woman jumps off bridge to escape her sadistic husband. Instead of dying on impact, she's dragged from the water, barely alive by a crazed doctor.The doctor decides that rather than nurse her back to health, he'll do a cesarean, and remove the mother's brain and replace it with her baby's, as her brain must have been bad if she were suicidal.The entire rest of the film is Emma Stone having sex and going full *Tropic Thunder warning* for the entire film. Full frontal nudity of both sexes throughout.The doctor's assistant agrees to marry Emma Stone (baby brain in mother's body) despite the fact she is so mentally handicapped, she can barely walk or form a complete sentence. Nevermind that's a huge breech of the duty of care between a provider and a patient, nevermind that the patient can't consent due to her disability and doesn't know what marriage even is, nevermind it's a LITERAL INFANT in an adult woman's body. Basically it's a one-sided Freaky Friday, except all Emma Stone's character wants to do is have sex non-stop.The doctor's assistant is considered the goog guy in the film, while the audience is tortured with shots of Emma Stone having predators have sex with her and then tire of her as she becomes less infantile. Emma decides to become a bisexual prostitute who then relaces her original sadistic husband's brain with that of a goat after he tries to drug her and have her clitoris removed.What is the message of this film? That without the chains of society, innocent children would do nothing but masterbate or have sex with adults? Emma Stone's character literally masturbates with an apple (!!!) at the dinner table. Why?On top of the egregious filth of a script, it's STEAMPUNK.Seriously, who wrote this script? Josh Duggar? Jimmy Saville?I don't care how nice the filming is or the costumes when this is the story.

"Poor Things","moviedays1","10 January 2024",NA,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity."
"Poor Things","awagne-29536","28 December 2023",NA,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Poor Things","pedroquintaoo","30 January 2024",NA,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."

In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
"Poor Things","SwissCheeze","3 January 2024",NA,"I wanted to like this film...but no. This film is just disturbing, and not in a good way. The film is about an INFANT who has her brain put into a woman's (the infant's mom) body. While the character may look like an adult, she is not...she is a CHILD. Let's make that clear.Immediately the child starts masturbating. Okay, uncomfortable, but maybe the director has something to say. So I stick with it. Next thing you know the child's father is offering her up to get married by his adult assistant who KNOWS that he is proposing to a child. A few scenes later Mark Ruffalo's character sneaks into her room, molests her and kidnaps her where he has rampant sex with her for several excruitatingly long scenes that span weeks if not months.It's crass and it's tasteless given that the character is a little girl with an adult woman's body, but again, while I wince, I'm assuming that it's going to all come together with some powerful social commentary that will be poignant and insightful. I'm mean, the reviews are stellar. Surely this will not be for naught...right?What is the characters big revelatory moment? She finds her agency by becoming a prostitute and - voila! - she's a complete human, a feminist at that! So essentially you have this little girl go through some seriously traumatic sexual abuse (replete with director awkwardly shows her insatiable desire for sex with adult men by having her literally beg for it constantly)...and then by ""embracing"" prostitution she is somehow magically ""liberated"" and transforms into a self-actualized being. Okay then.Not only is this some poorly thought out social commentary and character development, but it's quite warped and disturbed if you let it sink in. This just felt like some perverted guy wrapping some sordid child sex abuse fantasy with a flimsy facade of female empowerment, except that empowerment isn't earned or justified given what happens in the story. Actually, I would say quite the opposite.Add in some really heavy handed and poorly construed themes (e.g., she literally refers to her father -like figure God...really now?) and some seriously forced situational comedy and you have just an insufferable film.The only bright side for me was the art direction and costume design. All style, no substance."
"Poor Things","kjproulx","6 January 2024",NA,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever."
"Poor Things","aciessi","24 December 2023",NA,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."

"Poor Things","Pjtaylor-96-138044","23 January 2024",NA,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naive and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy)."
"Poor Things","nicolasroop","22 December 2023",NA,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
"Poor Things","reelreviewsandrecommendations","22 January 2024",NA,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"Poor Things","Lepidopterous_","8 December 2023",NA,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Poor Things","Camerenth","15 December 2023",NA,"The story is so bizarre and what occurs can only be explained as a chaos of emotions but the movie translates that into one of the best coming of age stories I have ever seen. Emma Stone is the star of this movie. She carries the movie's bizarre scenes and dives fully into the this chaotic character. The movie does not shy away from its R rating and challenges the audience on what to feel during those moments. The supporting cast is just as weird and quirky in all the best ways. Mark Ruffalo especially is almost unrecognizable from his recent roles but is a lovable stand out and is usually the centerpiece of many of the jokes of the movie. This is a must watch for its original story and beautiful world it creates."
"Poor Things","evanston_dad","19 December 2023",NA,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
"Poor Things","MattyLuke-81663","20 November 2023",NA,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
"Poor Things","imseeg","9 December 2023",NA,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
"Poor Things","UniqueParticle","29 December 2023",NA,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
"Poor Things","laurenspierre","19 October 2023",NA,"""She's like nothing you've ever seen""The same can be said for this film, which I saw at Film Fest Gent in a packed theater. It was the 5th film of the day for all of us there, but the audience was lively and exuberant. And it's no wonder, since Poor Things is nothing short of a monumental achievement: it is at once the funniest, smartest, best looking and most entertaining film of 2023. With its radical inventiveness and audacious creativity, this masterpiece may turn out to be viewed as a cinematic milestone by future generations. At the very least, Poor Things is Yorgos Lanthimos' magnum opus and deserving of instant classic status.The plot outline for Poor Things could be described as Frankenstein with a modern, feminist twist, with Godwin 'God' Baxter (William Dafoe) assuming the role of the doctor who brings Bella Baxter (Emma Stone) back from the dead. As an adult woman equipped with the brain of an infant, Bella is blessed with the intense curiosity and sense of wonder that only a newborn can have. She quickly develops a will of her own and it isn't long before she escapes her imposed confinement (shades of Lanthimos' debut film Dogtooth) by running off with smarmy lawyer Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo) on a journey of exploration of both herself and the world.I cannot say enough about the breathtaking cinematography and spectacular production design of this film, which is quite frankly atypical of what I'd had to come expect from a Lanthimos film. Not that his previous films have looked bad, but ""visually striking"" is just not what pops up first when calling to mind his films. The first act, which takes place at Dr. Baxter's mansion, is filmed in gorgeous black and white (a nod to the original Frankenstein adaptation perhaps?) and already displays some bold artistic choices, such as the frequent use of fish-eye lenses to create distorted images. But it is once Bella embarks on her adventure into the outside world that we realize we're not in Kansas anymore. Stunning visuals of luscious sets and amazing costumes in impossibly vivid colors light up the screen, as we discover an exaggeratedly artificial world through Bella's perspective, being one of childlike bewilderment.Emma Stone gives a career-defining performance as Bella Baxter. When we first meet her, Bella is less a person than a stumbling 'creature' equipped with the vocabulary of a child. Stone does an excellent job of portraying Bella's development towards becoming a 'real person', by gradually improving her grasp of language and her manner of walking, to name just a couple of things. She also convincingly sells the incredible character arc that Bella goes through during this film. It's a physically and mentally demanding role, the kind of performance they usually hand out Oscars for.William Dafoe is perfectly cast as mad scientist Godwin Baxter, who looks more like the monster of Frankenstein than the doctor that created him. Dafoe unsurprisingly does a fantastic job here, knowingly leaning into the absurdity of the story with some of his delivery, but still playing his character sincerely.A special mention has to go to Mark Ruffalo as Duncan Wedderburn here, the impossibly suave globetrotter and self-proclaimed ladykiller who brings temptation into Bella's life and takes her into the wide world. Ruffalo chews the scenery, playing Wedderburn almost as a parody of the archetypical smooth womanizer and delivering his lines with visible glee. But his histrionics actually suit the arc of his character perfectly, as he is eventually driven to utter madness by Bella's insatiable taste for sexual and intellectual exploration and the often irrefutable logic she uses to explain her actions and dismiss his complaints.However, Poor Things doesn't only overwhelm with its abundance of style and larger-than-life performances, it has something to say too. As Bella, with the voraciousness a child, develops a taste for both sexual and intellectual gratification, the film cleverly uses her unbiased perspective to ask seemingly logical questions about some of the the established gender roles and class roles she perceives in the world around her. Who would have thought that Yorgos Lanthimos, the Greek director known for his idiosyncratic style, which often expresses a cynical worldview through pitch-black, deadpan comedy, would be the one to deliver not only the most visually dazzling film of 2023, but also the most piercing critique of the patriarchy and established gender roles? (looking at you there, Barbie)Time will tell if Poor Things will be heralded as the game changer that I personally envision it to be, but at the very least we can just be happy that such a defiantly original and wonderfully creative film was made to be consumed by a mainstream audience here in 2023. As long as this kind of uniquely cinematic experience continues to exist, we can look optimistically at the future of the medium. Go see this film!"
"Poor Things","drownsoda90","22 December 2023",NA,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
"Poor Things","Xstal","14 January 2024",NA,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."

Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film."

Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
"Poor Things","Sleepin_Dragon","9 January 2024",NA,"Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
"Poor Things","pd-19490","20 January 2024",NA,"My previous attempts at reviewing this were declined possibly due to how I expressed my strong opinions about the movie. I will try again with as much restraint as I can and try not to insert my opinion. So here it goes. The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she still has the mind of a child. These men know she has the mind of a child and yet continue anyway. I will let you interpret that how you will. I won't watch it again. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do."
"Poor Things","rachelnstephens","1 January 2024",NA,"Pregnant woman jumps off bridge to escape her sadistic husband. Instead of dying on impact, she's dragged from the water, barely alive by a crazed doctor.The doctor decides that rather than nurse her back to health, he'll do a cesarean, and remove the mother's brain and replace it with her baby's, as her brain must have been bad if she were suicidal.The entire rest of the film is Emma Stone having sex and going full *Tropic Thunder warning* for the entire film. Full frontal nudity of both sexes throughout.The doctor's assistant agrees to marry Emma Stone (baby brain in mother's body) despite the fact she is so mentally handicapped, she can barely walk or form a complete sentence. Nevermind that's a huge breech of the duty of care between a provider and a patient, nevermind that the patient can't consent due to her disability and doesn't know what marriage even is, nevermind it's a LITERAL INFANT in an adult woman's body. Basically it's a one-sided Freaky Friday, except all Emma Stone's character wants to do is have sex non-stop.The doctor's assistant is considered the goog guy in the film, while the audience is tortured with shots of Emma Stone having predators have sex with her and then tire of her as she becomes less infantile. Emma decides to become a bisexual prostitute who then relaces her original sadistic husband's brain with that of a goat after he tries to drug her and have her clitoris removed.What is the message of this film? That without the chains of society, innocent children would do nothing but masterbate or have sex with adults? Emma Stone's character literally masturbates with an apple (!!!) at the dinner table. Why?On top of the egregious filth of a script, it's STEAMPUNK.Seriously, who wrote this script? Josh Duggar? Jimmy Saville?I don't care how nice the filming is or the costumes when this is the story.

"Poor Things","moviedays1","10 January 2024",NA,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity."
"Poor Things","awagne-29536","28 December 2023",NA,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Poor Things","pedroquintaoo","30 January 2024",NA,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"Poor Things","lbenot","28 December 2023",NA,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
"Poor Things","SwissCheeze","3 January 2024",NA,"I wanted to like this film...but no. This film is just disturbing, and not in a good way. The film is about an INFANT who has her brain put into a woman's (the infant's mom) body. While the character may look like an adult, she is not...she is a CHILD. Let's make that clear.Immediately the child starts masturbating. Okay, uncomfortable, but maybe the director has something to say. So I stick with it. Next thing you know the child's father is offering her up to get married by his adult assistant who KNOWS that he is proposing to a child. A few scenes later Mark Ruffalo's character sneaks into her room, molests her and kidnaps her where he has rampant sex with her for several excruitatingly long scenes that span weeks if not months.It's crass and it's tasteless given that the character is a little girl with an adult woman's body, but again, while I wince, I'm assuming that it's going to all come together with some powerful social commentary that will be poignant and insightful. I'm mean, the reviews are stellar. Surely this will not be for naught...right?What is the characters big revelatory moment? She finds her agency by becoming a prostitute and - voila! - she's a complete human, a feminist at that! So essentially you have this little girl go through some seriously traumatic sexual abuse (replete with director awkwardly shows her insatiable desire for sex with adult men by having her literally beg for it constantly)...and then by ""embracing"" prostitution she is somehow magically ""liberated"" and transforms into a self-actualized being. Okay then.Not only is this some poorly thought out social commentary and character development, but it's quite warped and disturbed if you let it sink in. This just felt like some perverted guy wrapping some sordid child sex abuse fantasy with a flimsy facade of female empowerment, except that empowerment isn't earned or justified given what happens in the story. Actually, I would say quite the opposite.Add in some really heavy handed and poorly construed themes (e.g., she literally refers to her father -like figure God...really now?) and some seriously forced situational comedy and you have just an insufferable film.The only bright side for me was the art direction and costume design. All style, no substance."
"Poor Things","kjproulx","6 January 2024",NA,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever."
"Poor Things","aciessi","24 December 2023",NA,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."

And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"Poor Things","Pjtaylor-96-138044","23 January 2024",NA,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naive and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy)."
"Poor Things","nicolasroop","22 December 2023",NA,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
"Poor Things","reelreviewsandrecommendations","22 January 2024",NA,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"Poor Things","Lepidopterous_","8 December 2023",NA,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Poor Things","Camerenth","15 December 2023",NA,"The story is so bizarre and what occurs can only be explained as a chaos of emotions but the movie translates that into one of the best coming of age stories I have ever seen. Emma Stone is the star of this movie. She carries the movie's bizarre scenes and dives fully into the this chaotic character. The movie does not shy away from its R rating and challenges the audience on what to feel during those moments. The supporting cast is just as weird and quirky in all the best ways. Mark Ruffalo especially is almost unrecognizable from his recent roles but is a lovable stand out and is usually the centerpiece of many of the jokes of the movie. This is a must watch for its original story and beautiful world it creates."
"Poor Things","evanston_dad","19 December 2023",NA,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
"Poor Things","MattyLuke-81663","20 November 2023",NA,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
"Poor Things","imseeg","9 December 2023",NA,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
"Poor Things","UniqueParticle","29 December 2023",NA,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
"Poor Things","laurenspierre","19 October 2023",NA,"""She's like nothing you've ever seen""The same can be said for this film, which I saw at Film Fest Gent in a packed theater. It was the 5th film of the day for all of us there, but the audience was lively and exuberant. And it's no wonder, since Poor Things is nothing short of a monumental achievement: it is at once the funniest, smartest, best looking and most entertaining film of 2023. With its radical inventiveness and audacious creativity, this masterpiece may turn out to be viewed as a cinematic milestone by future generations. At the very least, Poor Things is Yorgos Lanthimos' magnum opus and deserving of instant classic status.The plot outline for Poor Things could be described as Frankenstein with a modern, feminist twist, with Godwin 'God' Baxter (William Dafoe) assuming the role of the doctor who brings Bella Baxter (Emma Stone) back from the dead. As an adult woman equipped with the brain of an infant, Bella is blessed with the intense curiosity and sense of wonder that only a newborn can have. She quickly develops a will of her own and it isn't long before she escapes her imposed confinement (shades of Lanthimos' debut film Dogtooth) by running off with smarmy lawyer Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo) on a journey of exploration of both herself and the world.I cannot say enough about the breathtaking cinematography and spectacular production design of this film, which is quite frankly atypical of what I'd had to come expect from a Lanthimos film. Not that his previous films have looked bad, but ""visually striking"" is just not what pops up first when calling to mind his films. The first act, which takes place at Dr. Baxter's mansion, is filmed in gorgeous black and white (a nod to the original Frankenstein adaptation perhaps?) and already displays some bold artistic choices, such as the frequent use of fish-eye lenses to create distorted images. But it is once Bella embarks on her adventure into the outside world that we realize we're not in Kansas anymore. Stunning visuals of luscious sets and amazing costumes in impossibly vivid colors light up the screen, as we discover an exaggeratedly artificial world through Bella's perspective, being one of childlike bewilderment.Emma Stone gives a career-defining performance as Bella Baxter. When we first meet her, Bella is less a person than a stumbling 'creature' equipped with the vocabulary of a child. Stone does an excellent job of portraying Bella's development towards becoming a 'real person', by gradually improving her grasp of language and her manner of walking, to name just a couple of things. She also convincingly sells the incredible character arc that Bella goes through during this film. It's a physically and mentally demanding role, the kind of performance they usually hand out Oscars for.William Dafoe is perfectly cast as mad scientist Godwin Baxter, who looks more like the monster of Frankenstein than the doctor that created him. Dafoe unsurprisingly does a fantastic job here, knowingly leaning into the absurdity of the story with some of his delivery, but still playing his character sincerely.A special mention has to go to Mark Ruffalo as Duncan Wedderburn here, the impossibly suave globetrotter and self-proclaimed ladykiller who brings temptation into Bella's life and takes her into the wide world. Ruffalo chews the scenery, playing Wedderburn almost as a parody of the archetypical smooth womanizer and delivering his lines with visible glee. But his histrionics actually suit the arc of his character perfectly, as he is eventually driven to utter madness by Bella's insatiable taste for sexual and intellectual exploration and the often irrefutable logic she uses to explain her actions and dismiss his complaints.However, Poor Things doesn't only overwhelm with its abundance of style and larger-than-life performances, it has something to say too. As Bella, with the voraciousness a child, develops a taste for both sexual and intellectual gratification, the film cleverly uses her unbiased perspective to ask seemingly logical questions about some of the the established gender roles and class roles she perceives in the world around her. Who would have thought that Yorgos Lanthimos, the Greek director known for his idiosyncratic style, which often expresses a cynical worldview through pitch-black, deadpan comedy, would be the one to deliver not only the most visually dazzling film of 2023, but also the most piercing critique of the patriarchy and established gender roles? (looking at you there, Barbie)Time will tell if Poor Things will be heralded as the game changer that I personally envision it to be, but at the very least we can just be happy that such a defiantly original and wonderfully creative film was made to be consumed by a mainstream audience here in 2023. As long as this kind of uniquely cinematic experience continues to exist, we can look optimistically at the future of the medium. Go see this film!"
"Poor Things","drownsoda90","22 December 2023",NA,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
"Poor Things","Xstal","14 January 2024",NA,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Poor Things","nicko252008","24 January 2024",NA,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film."
"Poor Things","jeff-gibson-835-273379","22 January 2024",NA,"High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
"Poor Things","Sleepin_Dragon","9 January 2024",NA,"Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
"Poor Things","pd-19490","20 January 2024",NA,"My previous attempts at reviewing this were declined possibly due to how I expressed my strong opinions about the movie. I will try again with as much restraint as I can and try not to insert my opinion. So here it goes. The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she still has the mind of a child. These men know she has the mind of a child and yet continue anyway. I will let you interpret that how you will. I won't watch it again. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do."
"Poor Things","rachelnstephens","1 January 2024",NA,"Pregnant woman jumps off bridge to escape her sadistic husband. Instead of dying on impact, she's dragged from the water, barely alive by a crazed doctor.The doctor decides that rather than nurse her back to health, he'll do a cesarean, and remove the mother's brain and replace it with her baby's, as her brain must have been bad if she were suicidal.The entire rest of the film is Emma Stone having sex and going full *Tropic Thunder warning* for the entire film. Full frontal nudity of both sexes throughout.The doctor's assistant agrees to marry Emma Stone (baby brain in mother's body) despite the fact she is so mentally handicapped, she can barely walk or form a complete sentence. Nevermind that's a huge breech of the duty of care between a provider and a patient, nevermind that the patient can't consent due to her disability and doesn't know what marriage even is, nevermind it's a LITERAL INFANT in an adult woman's body. Basically it's a one-sided Freaky Friday, except all Emma Stone's character wants to do is have sex non-stop.The doctor's assistant is considered the goog guy in the film, while the audience is tortured with shots of Emma Stone having predators have sex with her and then tire of her as she becomes less infantile. Emma decides to become a bisexual prostitute who then relaces her original sadistic husband's brain with that of a goat after he tries to drug her and have her clitoris removed.What is the message of this film? That without the chains of society, innocent children would do nothing but masterbate or have sex with adults? Emma Stone's character literally masturbates with an apple (!!!) at the dinner table. Why?On top of the egregious filth of a script, it's STEAMPUNK.Seriously, who wrote this script? Josh Duggar? Jimmy Saville?I don't care how nice the filming is or the costumes when this is the story.

"Poor Things","moviedays1","10 January 2024",NA,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity."
"Poor Things","awagne-29536","28 December 2023",NA,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Poor Things","pedroquintaoo","30 January 2024",NA,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"Poor Things","lbenot","28 December 2023",NA,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
"Poor Things","SwissCheeze","3 January 2024",NA,"I wanted to like this film...but no. This film is just disturbing, and not in a good way. The film is about an INFANT who has her brain put into a woman's (the infant's mom) body. While the character may look like an adult, she is not...she is a CHILD. Let's make that clear.Immediately the child starts masturbating. Okay, uncomfortable, but maybe the director has something to say. So I stick with it. Next thing you know the child's father is offering her up to get married by his adult assistant who KNOWS that he is proposing to a child. A few scenes later Mark Ruffalo's character sneaks into her room, molests her and kidnaps her where he has rampant sex with her for several excruitatingly long scenes that span weeks if not months.It's crass and it's tasteless given that the character is a little girl with an adult woman's body, but again, while I wince, I'm assuming that it's going to all come together with some powerful social commentary that will be poignant and insightful. I'm mean, the reviews are stellar. Surely this will not be for naught...right?What is the characters big revelatory moment? She finds her agency by becoming a prostitute and - voila! - she's a complete human, a feminist at that! So essentially you have this little girl go through some seriously traumatic sexual abuse (replete with director awkwardly shows her insatiable desire for sex with adult men by having her literally beg for it constantly)...and then by ""embracing"" prostitution she is somehow magically ""liberated"" and transforms into a self-actualized being. Okay then.Not only is this some poorly thought out social commentary and character development, but it's quite warped and disturbed if you let it sink in. This just felt like some perverted guy wrapping some sordid child sex abuse fantasy with a flimsy facade of female empowerment, except that empowerment isn't earned or justified given what happens in the story. Actually, I would say quite the opposite.Add in some really heavy handed and poorly construed themes (e.g., she literally refers to her father -like figure God...really now?) and some seriously forced situational comedy and you have just an insufferable film.The only bright side for me was the art direction and costume design. All style, no substance."
"Poor Things","kjproulx","6 January 2024",NA,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever."
"Poor Things","aciessi","24 December 2023",NA,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
"Poor Things","parksiet","31 December 2023",NA,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"Poor Things","Pjtaylor-96-138044","23 January 2024",NA,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naive and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy)."
"Poor Things","nicolasroop","22 December 2023",NA,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."
"Poor Things","reelreviewsandrecommendations","22 January 2024",NA,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"Poor Things","Lepidopterous_","8 December 2023",NA,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Poor Things","Camerenth","15 December 2023",NA,"The story is so bizarre and what occurs can only be explained as a chaos of emotions but the movie translates that into one of the best coming of age stories I have ever seen. Emma Stone is the star of this movie. She carries the movie's bizarre scenes and dives fully into the this chaotic character. The movie does not shy away from its R rating and challenges the audience on what to feel during those moments. The supporting cast is just as weird and quirky in all the best ways. Mark Ruffalo especially is almost unrecognizable from his recent roles but is a lovable stand out and is usually the centerpiece of many of the jokes of the movie. This is a must watch for its original story and beautiful world it creates."
"Poor Things","evanston_dad","19 December 2023",NA,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
"Poor Things","MattyLuke-81663","20 November 2023",NA,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
"Poor Things","imseeg","9 December 2023",NA,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
"Poor Things","UniqueParticle","29 December 2023",NA,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
"Poor Things","laurenspierre","19 October 2023",NA,"""She's like nothing you've ever seen""The same can be said for this film, which I saw at Film Fest Gent in a packed theater. It was the 5th film of the day for all of us there, but the audience was lively and exuberant. And it's no wonder, since Poor Things is nothing short of a monumental achievement: it is at once the funniest, smartest, best looking and most entertaining film of 2023. With its radical inventiveness and audacious creativity, this masterpiece may turn out to be viewed as a cinematic milestone by future generations. At the very least, Poor Things is Yorgos Lanthimos' magnum opus and deserving of instant classic status.The plot outline for Poor Things could be described as Frankenstein with a modern, feminist twist, with Godwin 'God' Baxter (William Dafoe) assuming the role of the doctor who brings Bella Baxter (Emma Stone) back from the dead. As an adult woman equipped with the brain of an infant, Bella is blessed with the intense curiosity and sense of wonder that only a newborn can have. She quickly develops a will of her own and it isn't long before she escapes her imposed confinement (shades of Lanthimos' debut film Dogtooth) by running off with smarmy lawyer Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo) on a journey of exploration of both herself and the world.I cannot say enough about the breathtaking cinematography and spectacular production design of this film, which is quite frankly atypical of what I'd had to come expect from a Lanthimos film. Not that his previous films have looked bad, but ""visually striking"" is just not what pops up first when calling to mind his films. The first act, which takes place at Dr. Baxter's mansion, is filmed in gorgeous black and white (a nod to the original Frankenstein adaptation perhaps?) and already displays some bold artistic choices, such as the frequent use of fish-eye lenses to create distorted images. But it is once Bella embarks on her adventure into the outside world that we realize we're not in Kansas anymore. Stunning visuals of luscious sets and amazing costumes in impossibly vivid colors light up the screen, as we discover an exaggeratedly artificial world through Bella's perspective, being one of childlike bewilderment.Emma Stone gives a career-defining performance as Bella Baxter. When we first meet her, Bella is less a person than a stumbling 'creature' equipped with the vocabulary of a child. Stone does an excellent job of portraying Bella's development towards becoming a 'real person', by gradually improving her grasp of language and her manner of walking, to name just a couple of things. She also convincingly sells the incredible character arc that Bella goes through during this film. It's a physically and mentally demanding role, the kind of performance they usually hand out Oscars for.William Dafoe is perfectly cast as mad scientist Godwin Baxter, who looks more like the monster of Frankenstein than the doctor that created him. Dafoe unsurprisingly does a fantastic job here, knowingly leaning into the absurdity of the story with some of his delivery, but still playing his character sincerely.A special mention has to go to Mark Ruffalo as Duncan Wedderburn here, the impossibly suave globetrotter and self-proclaimed ladykiller who brings temptation into Bella's life and takes her into the wide world. Ruffalo chews the scenery, playing Wedderburn almost as a parody of the archetypical smooth womanizer and delivering his lines with visible glee. But his histrionics actually suit the arc of his character perfectly, as he is eventually driven to utter madness by Bella's insatiable taste for sexual and intellectual exploration and the often irrefutable logic she uses to explain her actions and dismiss his complaints.However, Poor Things doesn't only overwhelm with its abundance of style and larger-than-life performances, it has something to say too. As Bella, with the voraciousness a child, develops a taste for both sexual and intellectual gratification, the film cleverly uses her unbiased perspective to ask seemingly logical questions about some of the the established gender roles and class roles she perceives in the world around her. Who would have thought that Yorgos Lanthimos, the Greek director known for his idiosyncratic style, which often expresses a cynical worldview through pitch-black, deadpan comedy, would be the one to deliver not only the most visually dazzling film of 2023, but also the most piercing critique of the patriarchy and established gender roles? (looking at you there, Barbie)Time will tell if Poor Things will be heralded as the game changer that I personally envision it to be, but at the very least we can just be happy that such a defiantly original and wonderfully creative film was made to be consumed by a mainstream audience here in 2023. As long as this kind of uniquely cinematic experience continues to exist, we can look optimistically at the future of the medium. Go see this film!"
"Poor Things","drownsoda90","22 December 2023",NA,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
"Poor Things","Xstal","14 January 2024",NA,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Poor Things","nicko252008","24 January 2024",NA,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film."
"Poor Things","jeff-gibson-835-273379","22 January 2024",NA,"High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!"
"Poor Things","Sleepin_Dragon","9 January 2024",NA,"Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."
"Poor Things","pd-19490","20 January 2024",NA,"My previous attempts at reviewing this were declined possibly due to how I expressed my strong opinions about the movie. I will try again with as much restraint as I can and try not to insert my opinion. So here it goes. The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she still has the mind of a child. These men know she has the mind of a child and yet continue anyway. I will let you interpret that how you will. I won't watch it again. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do."
"Poor Things","rachelnstephens","1 January 2024",NA,"Pregnant woman jumps off bridge to escape her sadistic husband. Instead of dying on impact, she's dragged from the water, barely alive by a crazed doctor.The doctor decides that rather than nurse her back to health, he'll do a cesarean, and remove the mother's brain and replace it with her baby's, as her brain must have been bad if she were suicidal.The entire rest of the film is Emma Stone having sex and going full *Tropic Thunder warning* for the entire film. Full frontal nudity of both sexes throughout.The doctor's assistant agrees to marry Emma Stone (baby brain in mother's body) despite the fact she is so mentally handicapped, she can barely walk or form a complete sentence. Nevermind that's a huge breech of the duty of care between a provider and a patient, nevermind that the patient can't consent due to her disability and doesn't know what marriage even is, nevermind it's a LITERAL INFANT in an adult woman's body. Basically it's a one-sided Freaky Friday, except all Emma Stone's character wants to do is have sex non-stop.The doctor's assistant is considered the goog guy in the film, while the audience is tortured with shots of Emma Stone having predators have sex with her and then tire of her as she becomes less infantile. Emma decides to become a bisexual prostitute who then relaces her original sadistic husband's brain with that of a goat after he tries to drug her and have her clitoris removed.What is the message of this film? That without the chains of society, innocent children would do nothing but masterbate or have sex with adults? Emma Stone's character literally masturbates with an apple (!!!) at the dinner table. Why?On top of the egregious filth of a script, it's STEAMPUNK.Seriously, who wrote this script? Josh Duggar? Jimmy Saville?I don't care how nice the filming is or the costumes when this is the story. This is the worst film I've ever seen to completion. FILTH!"
"Poor Things","moviedays1","10 January 2024",NA,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity."
"Poor Things","awagne-29536","28 December 2023",NA,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos."
"Poor Things","pedroquintaoo","30 January 2024",NA,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative."
"Poor Things","lbenot","28 December 2023",NA,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash."
"Poor Things","SwissCheeze","3 January 2024",NA,"I wanted to like this film...but no. This film is just disturbing, and not in a good way. The film is about an INFANT who has her brain put into a woman's (the infant's mom) body. While the character may look like an adult, she is not...she is a CHILD. Let's make that clear.Immediately the child starts masturbating. Okay, uncomfortable, but maybe the director has something to say. So I stick with it. Next thing you know the child's father is offering her up to get married by his adult assistant who KNOWS that he is proposing to a child. A few scenes later Mark Ruffalo's character sneaks into her room, molests her and kidnaps her where he has rampant sex with her for several excruitatingly long scenes that span weeks if not months.It's crass and it's tasteless given that the character is a little girl with an adult woman's body, but again, while I wince, I'm assuming that it's going to all come together with some powerful social commentary that will be poignant and insightful. I'm mean, the reviews are stellar. Surely this will not be for naught...right?What is the characters big revelatory moment? She finds her agency by becoming a prostitute and - voila! - she's a complete human, a feminist at that! So essentially you have this little girl go through some seriously traumatic sexual abuse (replete with director awkwardly shows her insatiable desire for sex with adult men by having her literally beg for it constantly)...and then by ""embracing"" prostitution she is somehow magically ""liberated"" and transforms into a self-actualized being. Okay then.Not only is this some poorly thought out social commentary and character development, but it's quite warped and disturbed if you let it sink in. This just felt like some perverted guy wrapping some sordid child sex abuse fantasy with a flimsy facade of female empowerment, except that empowerment isn't earned or justified given what happens in the story. Actually, I would say quite the opposite.Add in some really heavy handed and poorly construed themes (e.g., she literally refers to her father -like figure God...really now?) and some seriously forced situational comedy and you have just an insufferable film.The only bright side for me was the art direction and costume design. All style, no substance."
"Poor Things","kjproulx","6 January 2024",NA,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever."
"Poor Things","aciessi","24 December 2023",NA,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here."
"Poor Things","parksiet","31 December 2023",NA,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!"
"Poor Things","Pjtaylor-96-138044","23 January 2024",NA,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naive and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy)."
"Poor Things","nicolasroop","22 December 2023",NA,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5."

Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment."
"Poor Things","Lepidopterous_","8 December 2023",NA,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one."
"Poor Things","Camerenth","15 December 2023",NA,"The story is so bizarre and what occurs can only be explained as a chaos of emotions but the movie translates that into one of the best coming of age stories I have ever seen. Emma Stone is the star of this movie. She carries the movie's bizarre scenes and dives fully into the this chaotic character. The movie does not shy away from its R rating and challenges the audience on what to feel during those moments. The supporting cast is just as weird and quirky in all the best ways. Mark Ruffalo especially is almost unrecognizable from his recent roles but is a lovable stand out and is usually the centerpiece of many of the jokes of the movie. This is a must watch for its original story and beautiful world it creates."
"Poor Things","evanston_dad","19 December 2023",NA,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-"
"Poor Things","MattyLuke-81663","20 November 2023",NA,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen."
"Poor Things","imseeg","9 December 2023",NA,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well..."
"Poor Things","UniqueParticle","29 December 2023",NA,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating."
"Poor Things","laurenspierre","19 October 2023",NA,"""She's like nothing you've ever seen""The same can be said for this film, which I saw at Film Fest Gent in a packed theater. It was the 5th film of the day for all of us there, but the audience was lively and exuberant. And it's no wonder, since Poor Things is nothing short of a monumental achievement: it is at once the funniest, smartest, best looking and most entertaining film of 2023. With its radical inventiveness and audacious creativity, this masterpiece may turn out to be viewed as a cinematic milestone by future generations. At the very least, Poor Things is Yorgos Lanthimos' magnum opus and deserving of instant classic status.The plot outline for Poor Things could be described as Frankenstein with a modern, feminist twist, with Godwin 'God' Baxter (William Dafoe) assuming the role of the doctor who brings Bella Baxter (Emma Stone) back from the dead. As an adult woman equipped with the brain of an infant, Bella is blessed with the intense curiosity and sense of wonder that only a newborn can have. She quickly develops a will of her own and it isn't long before she escapes her imposed confinement (shades of Lanthimos' debut film Dogtooth) by running off with smarmy lawyer Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo) on a journey of exploration of both herself and the world.I cannot say enough about the breathtaking cinematography and spectacular production design of this film, which is quite frankly atypical of what I'd had to come expect from a Lanthimos film. Not that his previous films have looked bad, but ""visually striking"" is just not what pops up first when calling to mind his films. The first act, which takes place at Dr. Baxter's mansion, is filmed in gorgeous black and white (a nod to the original Frankenstein adaptation perhaps?) and already displays some bold artistic choices, such as the frequent use of fish-eye lenses to create distorted images. But it is once Bella embarks on her adventure into the outside world that we realize we're not in Kansas anymore. Stunning visuals of luscious sets and amazing costumes in impossibly vivid colors light up the screen, as we discover an exaggeratedly artificial world through Bella's perspective, being one of childlike bewilderment.Emma Stone gives a career-defining performance as Bella Baxter. When we first meet her, Bella is less a person than a stumbling 'creature' equipped with the vocabulary of a child. Stone does an excellent job of portraying Bella's development towards becoming a 'real person', by gradually improving her grasp of language and her manner of walking, to name just a couple of things. She also convincingly sells the incredible character arc that Bella goes through during this film. It's a physically and mentally demanding role, the kind of performance they usually hand out Oscars for.William Dafoe is perfectly cast as mad scientist Godwin Baxter, who looks more like the monster of Frankenstein than the doctor that created him. Dafoe unsurprisingly does a fantastic job here, knowingly leaning into the absurdity of the story with some of his delivery, but still playing his character sincerely.A special mention has to go to Mark Ruffalo as Duncan Wedderburn here, the impossibly suave globetrotter and self-proclaimed ladykiller who brings temptation into Bella's life and takes her into the wide world. Ruffalo chews the scenery, playing Wedderburn almost as a parody of the archetypical smooth womanizer and delivering his lines with visible glee. But his histrionics actually suit the arc of his character perfectly, as he is eventually driven to utter madness by Bella's insatiable taste for sexual and intellectual exploration and the often irrefutable logic she uses to explain her actions and dismiss his complaints.However, Poor Things doesn't only overwhelm with its abundance of style and larger-than-life performances, it has something to say too. As Bella, with the voraciousness a child, develops a taste for both sexual and intellectual gratification, the film cleverly uses her unbiased perspective to ask seemingly logical questions about some of the the established gender roles and class roles she perceives in the world around her. Who would have thought that Yorgos Lanthimos, the Greek director known for his idiosyncratic style, which often expresses a cynical worldview through pitch-black, deadpan comedy, would be the one to deliver not only the most visually dazzling film of 2023, but also the most piercing critique of the patriarchy and established gender roles? (looking at you there, Barbie)Time will tell if Poor Things will be heralded as the game changer that I personally envision it to be, but at the very least we can just be happy that such a defiantly original and wonderfully creative film was made to be consumed by a mainstream audience here in 2023. As long as this kind of uniquely cinematic experience continues to exist, we can look optimistically at the future of the medium. Go see this film!"
"Poor Things","drownsoda90","22 December 2023",NA,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10."
"Poor Things","Xstal","14 January 2024",NA,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control."
"Poor Things","nicko252008","24 January 2024",NA,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film."

Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years.

I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10."

I will try again with as much restraint as I can and try not to insert my opinion. So here it goes. The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she still has the mind of a child. These men know she has the mind of a child and yet continue anyway. I will let you interpret that how you will. I won't watch it again. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do."

Full frontal nudity of both sexes throughout.The doctor's assistant agrees to marry Emma Stone (baby brain in mother's body) despite the fact she is so mentally handicapped, she can barely walk or form a complete sentence. Nevermind that's a huge breech of the duty of care between a provider and a patient, nevermind that the patient can't consent due to her disability and doesn't know what marriage even is, nevermind it's a LITERAL INFANT in an adult woman's body. Basically it's a one-sided Freaky Friday, except all Emma Stone's character wants to do is have sex non-stop.The doctor's assistant is considered the goog guy in the film, while the audience is tortured with shots of Emma Stone having predators have sex with her and then tire of her as she becomes less infantile. Emma decides to become a bisexual prostitute who then relaces her original sadistic husband's brain with that of a goat after he tries to drug her and have her clitoris removed.What is the message of this film?

"Poor Things","moviedays1","10 January 2024",NA,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity."

Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out.

"Poor Things","pedroquintaoo","30 January 2024",NA,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated.

Let's make that clear.Immediately the child starts masturbating. Okay, uncomfortable, but maybe the director has something to say. So I stick with it. Next thing you know the child's father is offering her up to get married by his adult assistant who KNOWS that he is proposing to a child. A few scenes later Mark Ruffalo's character sneaks into her room, molests her and kidnaps her where he has rampant sex with her for several excruitatingly long scenes that span weeks if not months.It's crass and it's tasteless given that the character is a little girl with an adult woman's body, but again, while I wince, I'm assuming that it's going to all come together with some powerful social commentary that will be poignant and insightful. I'm mean, the reviews are stellar. Surely this will not be for naught...right?What is the characters big revelatory moment? She finds her agency by becoming a prostitute and - voila! - she's a complete human, a feminist at that! So essentially you have this little girl go through some seriously traumatic sexual abuse (replete with director awkwardly shows her insatiable desire for sex with adult men by having her literally beg for it constantly)...and then by ""embracing"" prostitution she is somehow magically ""liberated"" and transforms into a self-actualized being. Okay then.Not only is this some poorly thought out social commentary and character development, but it's quite warped and disturbed if you let it sink in. This just felt like some perverted guy wrapping some sordid child sex abuse fantasy with a flimsy facade of female empowerment, except that empowerment isn't earned or justified given what happens in the story. Actually, I would say quite the opposite.Add in some really heavy handed and poorly construed themes (e.g., she literally refers to her father -like figure God...really now?) and some seriously forced situational comedy and you have just an insufferable film.The only bright side for me was the art direction and costume design. All style, no substance."
