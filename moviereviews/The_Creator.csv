"The Creator","poseyfan","29 September 2023",710,"This is a lesson to the movie industry on how to use a budget. 80 million dollars was used splendidly. The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects. AND filmmakers everywhere should learn how a budget should be used."
"The Creator","prberg2","30 September 2023",510,"Oh, I really wanted to like this movie. Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important ""weapon/creation""? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way."
"The Creator","BA_Harrison","27 September 2023",510,"The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb."
"The Creator","weraqs","25 November 2023",710,"Walking into the theater, my expectations were a mix of excitement and curiosity, especially given the film's intriguing take on AI.From the get-go, ""The Creator"" impressed me with its use of the $80 million budget. The cinematography was nothing short of remarkable, reminding me of the visual flair seen in ""Blade Runner"" ""Elysium"", ""I, Robot"" and ""A. I."" The world-building was immersive, creating a believable and lived-in environment that drew me in.The performances, particularly the dynamic between Joshua and Alfie, were the highlights of the film for me. Their interactions brought depth to the story, and I found myself genuinely invested in their journey. However, as the plot progressed, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment.The story, which began with promise, started to unravel. The pacing felt rushed, and the plot became increasingly predictable. I noticed glaring plot holes that were hard to overlook, and the narrative lacked the depth I had hoped for. The ambitious theme of AI's humanity, which initially seemed thought-provoking, was undermined by the film's inability to maintain coherence.While I appreciated the technical brilliance of the film, including the special effects and sound design, the script was a letdown. It was as if the movie wanted to say something profound about AI and humanity but ended up glossing over these complex themes, opting instead for a more superficial treatment.The characters, aside from Joshua, felt one-dimensional. I struggled to connect with them emotionally, this emotional disconnect was particularly evident in the portrayal of the AI characters, including Alfie, who, despite being central to the story, lacked the depth to make their plight resonate with me.While ""The Creator"" started off with great potential, it ultimately left me feeling underwhelmed. The film excelled in its visual storytelling but fell short in its narrative execution. It was a visually captivating experience, but the lack of emotional depth and narrative coherence made it a disappointing outing for me. I walked out of the theater feeling that the movie, despite its grand aspirations, missed the mark in delivering a fully engaging and thought-provoking sci-fi experience. It could have been a masterpiece, but a missed opportunity at best."
"The Creator","FeastMode","28 September 2023",410,"Sigh. As a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was looking forward to this new original stand-alone sci-fi movie. And I left fully disappointed. It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie. It could not get me engaged or invested, which is not a difficult task for someone who loves movie as much as I do.(1 viewing, early access screening UltraScreen 9/27/2023)"
"The Creator","kgprophet","29 September 2023",510,"Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick ""The Gray Man"". ""Creator"" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in ""The Manchurian"". Or the chosen kid in ""The Last Airbender"". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in ""Willow"". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In ""Creator"", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of ""Chappie"" with a robot police force. It could also resemble ""Elysium"", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, ""Apocalypse Now""-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish ""assassin turned compassionate"" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go ""Huh?"" ""What?"". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping on the ""A. I."" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words ""Artificial Intelligence"" and ""A. I."" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making ""Rogue One: A Star Wars story"". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10."
"The Creator","Jim_Screechy","17 November 2023",510,"I watched this from start to finish without being drawn into the story at any point.I think John Washington is miscast here, I had the same exact experience when i watched Tenet... found myself very disconnected as I he didn't seem to make a proper connection with the role he was portraying.That is not to say the film isn't without issues. They have been fairly well documented by other reviewers so I'll not labour the points here.My main issue is with the lack of emotional involvment with the characters. The film measures zero on the emtional richter scale, but more, the screenplay just doesn't manage to get you excited or involved with anything that is unfolding. Additionally, the characters seem to have little connection to each other. In fact it is only at the end of the movie that Joshua and Alphie seem to have any tangible emotional cohesion.Contrast this with The Golden Child 1986 where Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell and the connection he makes to The Golden Child played by J. L. Reate. Here you can see what a great connection is established on screen and the massive difference in outcome it produces. Both films have two similar sets of pairings in almost identical scenarios with a stark contrast in outcome.Anyway, for me the film was a big dissapointment, I can't say John David Washington was the cause of this since the Movie has many other problematic aspects, but the ones I've mentioned were particularly significant for me.5/10 sadly."
"The Creator","davemanson","11 October 2023",410,"With stunning visuals reminiscent of Blade Runner and the more recent Rouge One this movie is stunning to look at. Unfortunately the script falls far short of living up to its inspired cinematography. It's full of plot holes and cringe worthy moments from it's extremely one dimensional villains. The plot twist are telegraphed from miles away and there are no real surprises to be had. Everything plays out exactly like you would expect it to. Which is a shame. The look and mood of this film is almost enough to save it. But in the end it falls flat and its potential is wasted. See it for the visuals. Forget it for its script."
"The Creator","kevin_robbins","30 September 2023",610,"My wife and I caught The Creator (2023) in theaters last night. The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once."
"The Creator","Lomax343","28 September 2023",610,"Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity."
"The Creator","alex_with_a_P","1 October 2023",410,"AI is such a rich topic, it can be explored from any kind of angles but this movie decided to use it only as a prop. The AI people are just stand-ins for oppressed people X. None of the AI people are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!), which is one of many advantages machines would have over humans. The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and in a better way.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Awkward change of tones, a weird plot structure with constant flashbacks, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas at play. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the 135min runtime, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to another.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country where the story takes place doesn't have military or a defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers will only be used for a door. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. The last action set piece in particular is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices. Next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. Mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, those have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their task of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing interesting. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. And I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only aesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame."
"The Creator","ethanbresnett","29 September 2023",710,"The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill.It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless.The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film.There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid.Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though."
"The Creator","jon_hsieh","1 October 2023",410,"4.8 ⭐
Absolutely stunning work from director Gareth Edwards and cinematographer Oren Soffer. Shot on a Sony FX3 and on location. Impressive. From color grades, shots and VFX...all top notch. A visual spectacle.Although Gareth Edwards pulls through visually, he fails miserably on the storyline. The amount of times my party sat there and looked at each other saying ""wait, what? Why?"" was too much to count. Things didnt add up and begs the audience to question many things. As if Edwards was just trying to get to an ending rather than build the story. Creating that tension or closeness between ai and humans was lacking.John Washington's mono tone, emotionless acting contributed to that disconnect. The exact ""read off the script"" acting we saw in Tenet. How he got this role is mind blowing and nepotism at its finest. His performance was only saved by child actor Madeleine Voyles, who was great. Few other questionable casting decisions, you'll see if you choose to not wait for the stream (the soccer mom playing a ruthless captain)All in all, this film was entertaining at the very least. Could have been awesome as i love how rogue one was done and im not a star wars fanatic.Worth the ticket? Eh yea not bad but definitely not a rewatch. Oh and ill never watch anything with John Washington again lol."
"The Creator","RussHog","1 January 2024",810,"My friend told me if I saw this in theaters some of the gaping plot holes would stand out more - but as it is I saw it at home and frankly I could care less if there were some plot holes this is a very good film with incredible world building.It tells the story of human v AI and our hero is a former soldier who is sent to track down the AI's ultimate weapon. Turns out the weapon is a child AI - who may or may not have the secret to his seemingly dead wife's location - and now our hero betrays his people to keep the AI safe and try to find his wife.His journey with the AI takes him deep into the heart of this world, and he eventually grows to care for the AI and rebels against his own people. It may sound cliche, but these kinds of stories need to be told again and again.By no stretch of the imagination is this corny like Avatar, this was a very good by the numbers sci-fi movie. Well acted, great special effects, good action scenes, and a big heart with a cool final showdown.Def recommended, too bad I didn't watch this in theaters."
"The Creator","Darksidecrew","28 September 2023",NA,"This new sci-fi film from Gareth Edwards (Rogue One) was made for $80 million but looks like $350 million on screen. It's a global epic on a massive scale. This is how I like films to look, I think it was probably shot on digital but they've made it look like it was shot on film. It does have shades of Terminator, Blade Runner and even Terrence Malick but it also brings some new dimensions to some classic themes. Not only the craftsmanship but the acting is also top notch in this fully immersive tale. It moves very quickly which will help you get past sone story logistics that might crumble on closer examination. A superb effort that leaves the glossy soulless and often brainless blockbusters of recent decades in the dust. A quality film that I recommend supporting in the theaters."
"The Creator","Padreviews","8 November 2023",410,"There are classic sci fi movies like Bladerunner then there's this - don't go expecting Bladerunner .It's not all bad , it just wasn't good .If you add the cgi skill of Neill Blomkampt films like District 9 & Elysium - but think more of the latter than the former you're getting close - all flash but script let it downI'm some ways it had similarities with Starship troopers & Terminator but here the lines were blurred as to who were the good guys & who were the baddies - if anything it was like Avatar where the aliens or AI replicants were actually the underdogs - not unlike what's happening in the Middle East right now or what happened to the native Americans when the Europeans colonised the westSo emotionally it should have done well but you didn't feel connected , the acting of the little child was a standout & you couldn't help but root for that characterAt the end of the day it wasn't a film you wanting to tell everyone to go and see it , it was quite the opposite & there's probably not enough material there for a sequel but perhaps a prequel might have legs although that might actually seem like a pun if you see the movieCGI 1 script 0Pad. A average 4/10."
"The Creator","nscoby93","29 September 2023",310,"That is literally all that comes to mind a disappointment. Going in, I genuinely wanted to like this movie. I mean the director of Rogue One doing a standalone new title sci-fi film. What could go wrong? Well, apparently, everything.Let me get through the positives because that's a short list. Good acting, a great concept, and an interesting world... um, that's it.So what's bad about this film? Well, literally everything else. The story is a mess and told equally as messy. The film is convulted and tries so hard to appear deep, intelligent, and emotional, yet it's all surface and is very plain to see how empty it truly is. Unfortunately, Hans Zimmers score does nothing here as the music just didn't stand out, so I was surprised to see that he composed the music.But I think what bothered me the most about this film is that it felt like a more annoying version of Avatar. Gareth Edward's, in my opinion, like James Cameron, shows absolutely no discretion on whom the audience should side with. It all comes off as manipulation and extremely biased. So humans bad, aliens good, turns into America/Western Culture bad, and New Asia/Eastern Culture good.There is no character on the side of the Americans aside from John David Washington's character who is ""good"" or likeable but on the side of the robots they are all victims and the people of New Asia are victims of the oppressive and evil Americans. Who are basically painted as this worlds version of the Empire. They even have a deadly space station. While the robots are the Rebel Alliance doing what they can to fight this evil.So obviously as a viewer and decent human being I won't side with the Americans but the film does nothing to prove to me these robots are the victims that Gareth Edward's so desperately wants me to believe. In fact, there's a sequence that proves to me the opposite that some of these robots will kill their own people to protect this child who is essentially a Christ like figure to the robots. There is absolutely no unbiased look at both sides in this Vietnam like conflict.Then, at the end of everything, the explanation as to the reason for this war is absolutely moronic, I'd say what it is, but that's touching on spoiler territory.The movie explains nothing in the way of what this AI is or how it became ""sentient,"" etc. Also, if these robots are so peaceful and innocent, then why not make an attempt at peace? But that wouldn't happen because America is evil and dead set on destroying all AI consciousness, so any peacetalks would undoubtedly fail. Edward's here expects the audience to take everything at face value and not question anything. Which is exactly what the liberal mind expects from you, so I shouldn't be surprised. Now, I wouldn't say Gareth Edward's is a liberal as I don't know the man, but he's playing with liberal ideologies.Then, the movie tries to be a social commentary on war, which fails miserable because it conflicts with the notion of the robots being all innocent victims. Essentially, the message being all war is unjust, and the ones who suffer the most are the innocent who get caught in the crossfire.So if this film truly wanted to show that war is the real enemy, then don't paint one side as innocent victims and paint the other as cruel, oppressive aggressors. Instead, put in some effort and show that both sides aren't innocent that both sides have done evil to one another.Finally the film is no where near as beautiful as trailers made it out to look, but I'm going to be honest here and say that's most likely due to the fact we watched this film in a crap auditorium. So, hopefully, upon a second viewing, which I do plan on having, it'll be with a better projector and screen. But also so much of this movie took place at night, which I could not understand why. Perhaps so they didn't have to show so much? I have no clue. The action, I guess, looked good, but I just didn't care for what was happening in it.Anyway, I will close things here and say I'm sure a great many people would disagree with me, but that's fine. These are the issues I had with this film, and they are simply my opinions. If you liked this movie, then great. I'm happy for you, but I am just genuinely disappointed. Though, after seeing the film, I can understand why it has mixed scores.IMDb: 3/10
Letterboxd: 2/5Watched in Theaters."
"The Creator","Xstal","2 October 2023",510,"As the opening kicks off there's expectations, that the film that's being screened has firm foundations, and to be fair it's a good start, rise of machines is at its heart, as well as difference, evolving change and diverse nations. There are hints of lots of things you've seen before, wars of stars and running blades are all top drawer, but once the façade has been cracked, you'll feel as though you're being hacked, as the pace turns to a saunter, and starts to bore. At the end you'll find the steam has all escaped, that the barrel comes so close to being scraped, an apocalypse of ages, just another war that rages, you're disappointed as you leave, and your coats draped."
"The Creator","benjaminskylerhill","28 September 2023",910,"Gareth Edwards proves himself to be an astoundingly brilliant director with The Creator, as he crafts a visual and auditory world rich with layers of detail, and characters that we quickly understand and naturally grow over the course of the story.He made an $80 million movie that looks like it cost at least twice that. This cost less than half of what Thor: Love and Thunder cost. Let that sink in.Edwards shows he's a better director than writer, as the film is far from original, borrowing concepts and themes from plenty of old classic sci-fi stories. And it's also burdened with some clunky dialogue and rushed, convenient crucial plot points.Yeah, it's imperfect. But it's made with a confidence and care that goes beyond the degree of admirable. It's an earnest expression of love, redemption, sacrifice, and forgiveness put out by a filmmaker who really cares for the characters whose story he's telling.It's a work of art that, even with its flaws, deserves to be seen."
"The Creator","FixedYourEnding","17 November 2023",410,"This is going to be an unpopular review, I know. Maybe I was in the wrong mood coming into this movie, but I turned it off after 25 minutes, couldn't stand it anymore. The whole premise of American white males are constant war-mongers and do not understand progress. If you are an African American you *might* be ok, it helps if you are hurt or imperfect in some other way, if you are a minority then you should be protected and saved, etc etc.The story as a whole makes little sense and it is remains incoherent with empty dialogues and mediocre acting. Why bombs, why the war, it is not explained and when those questions are asked they reply is some sort of a joke, such as ""they are here for our jobs"". Also not explained why would someone remove his prosthetic arm before going to the pool but not his leg. Whatever.The only redeemable quality for this movie is the production value and the almost next-gen gaming-like scenario and photography. I guess if you can ignore everything else, and just look at the imagery you might enjoy it. I personally needed a little more, or actually quite a lot more.This is another polarizing creation. I fell on the ""don't like it"" side, two thumbs down for me. Looks like writers were on strike but CGI was on sale. Exact score: 44 / 100."
"The Creator","masonsaul","28 September 2023",810,"The Creator is an all too rare piece of original epic sci-fi that's built on very familiar foundations and uses them to create something that's as visually exciting as it is emotionally investing, completely unafraid to show American military might for the soulless monster it is.John David Washington plays his reluctant father figure in terrific fashion, closed off at first but those barriers are all successfully worn down by the end. In her screen debut Madeleine Yuna Voyles is amazing, adorable and undoubtedly the main reason any of this works on an emotional level.Supporting them is Ken Watanabe being as effortlessly stoic as always and Allison Janney as an antagonist with a solid amount of depth all thanks to just one scene which efficiently explains her viewpoint in a believable fashion but she's also just plain ruthless in her relentless pursuit.Gareth Edwards once again proves he doesn't need established franchises to create epic imagery or fascinating worlds on a blockbuster scale. Between the stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser & Oren Soffer and the ridiculously impressive CG it outdoes the majority of the competition on a fraction of the cost.Uncharacteristically for Gareth Edwards there's a fair few needle drops early on, the choices can be obvious but always effective and the music by Hans Zimmer is solid. It's mostly just fine up until the third act where it really comes to life and avoids feeling wasted."
"The Creator","CANpatbuck3664","20 October 2023",710,"Starting my review of the creator with some comments on the acting, I'm surprised at how meteoric John David Washington's rise to the top has been. He's a good actor for sure but he's not just ascending the staircase, he's jumping a few steps at a time. He's anchoring the Creator as our protagonist Joshua. I think he's good in the movie, he's brooding for what feels like most of the run time but when he's given a chance to either be funny in short bursts or vulnerable near the end, he gets the job done. Madeleine Yuna Voyles is fine as Alphie, she accomplishes what's required in any given scene and by the end of the movie, she does what she can in regards to selling the bond her character has with Joshua. It's hard to deliver a noteworthy performance as a child actor/actress and she's better than passable. I keep waiting for the Gemma Chan's breakout role but this is one of her better performances as Maya. She has chemistry with Washington but she's given little to do on her own. She's appropriately cast and she sticks the landing in her part. My two favourite performances were from the veteran members of the supporting cast in Ken Watanabe and Allison Janney as Harun and Colonel Howell respectively. Janney pushes the envelope just far enough without descending into being a cartoon character, her character's palpable hatred for the Simulants creates tension and the amount of disdain she conveys through just a look is impressive. Watanabe brings strength to Harun when he needs to but there's also a lot of warmth when his character is bonding with Alphie.Despite some solid work from the cast overall, I'd bet what's probably going to draw your attention in the marketing material for The Creator is the design of this dystopian world and how the war between humans and A. I. dazzles on the big screen. Gareth Edwards and his team weren't working with pennies but this is as impressive of a display for a science fiction movie that I've seen in quite a while. The cinematography is fantastic, the character design of the robots evoked Neil Blomkamp's work for me in the best way without ripping it off and the action set pieces are memorable enough to hold your interest. The movie is just as fantastical (or grounded depending on your opinion on the future of artificial intelligence) as any other sci-fi epic, but there's a beautiful mix of real imagination that keeps the movie grounded just enough that you can still take it seriously. I found it disarming that it was so excellently realized and even if you aren't enthralled by the story, The Creator is still a delight from a visual perspective.I would describe The Creator as story driven as opposed to character driven but we spend enough time with Joshua, Alphie and their friends and enemies to get to know them. I liked the work done on the characters but I wasn't emotionally invested in whether Josh and Maya were going to reunite or if Alphie would make it away safely. I don't want to point the finger at the scriptwriters or the creative team, I was left wondering how much of this movie had been cut out and left on the cutting room floor. Scenes normally required to get us to invest in some of these relationships (e.g. Josh & Alfie, Josh & Shipley or Colonel Howell & McBride) felt like they were missing to me. I don't want to complain about the run time because The Creator isn't a short movie but I was left wondering if they cleaved off a little more than they should have.My most prominent problem with The Creator was how easy to guess the overall arc of the plot was. I didn't discern what it was going to do minute by minute but you can get where the story will start, advance to and finish largely from the trailer. There are some surprises here and there but if you zoom out and observe the macro progression of the plot, this ground has been covered before. Cliche seems a little harsh of a description but The Creator still lacks something bold in where it decides to venture and I was a little disappointed by that.The Creator really falls between a 7-8 for me but this is one of the rare situations where I'm going to round down. The film is still a spectacle and if you can get over that the plot is a little recycled in certain respects, there's a lot here to enjoy. Gareth Edwards and his team deserve kudos for making The Creator a worthy theatre experience. But I still wasn't blown-away by this movie and I wanted it to really kick into the next gear to get past the 8/10 mark. The Creator is a solid science fiction adventure that is worth checking out on the biggest screen you can but outside of it's CGI and visual sensibilities, I don't think it will have the staying power to make the huge impact it's clearly swinging for."
"The Creator","Imshortok06","30 September 2023",510,"You know a movie is bad when you take your Asian immigrant dad to go watch it with you and the first thing he says after watching it is ""Okay, which communist wrote this?!"" The movie's message seemed to be America: bad; military: bad; Asia: good. And there didn't seem to be any compelling reason to root for the robots other than the fact that the kid was cute and the other AI were poor villagers. It seems to me that in order for a movie to be good, the message should be complex and universally compelling. I didn't get what the message was, other than what I previously stated. Literally every bad guy was white and American. It's either very biased or very patronizing. On the other hand, I did think the actors did a good job, and the cinematography was outstanding."
"The Creator","DanTheMan2150AD","28 September 2023",710,"7 years on from his last big screen venture with the phenomenal Rogue One, The Creator isn't quite the comeback I had hoped for director Gareth Edwards. Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid ""simulants"", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic."
"The Creator","TheVictoriousV","1 October 2023",510,"When the trailer for The Creator came out, I basically became a Facebook Disney fangirl but, like, the opposite.I was all ""OMGOMG it's a big Hollywood sci-fi movie but, like, it's made by a director with a voice and... Get this... it's based on ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No really, they FINALLY remade/rebooted/did a sequel to NOT A DAMN THING!! OMGOMG, I've waited my whole life for originality! TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!""Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be ""huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot. Some of these images are worthy of the pages of Simon Stålenhag.Here's hoping Edwards someday adapts some of his tales."
"The Creator","poseyfan","29 September 2023",710,"This is a lesson to the movie industry on how to use a budget. 80 million dollars was used splendidly. The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects. AND filmmakers everywhere should learn how a budget should be used."
"The Creator","prberg2","30 September 2023",510,"Oh, I really wanted to like this movie. Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important ""weapon/creation""? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way."
"The Creator","BA_Harrison","27 September 2023",510,"The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb."
"The Creator","weraqs","25 November 2023",710,"Walking into the theater, my expectations were a mix of excitement and curiosity, especially given the film's intriguing take on AI.From the get-go, ""The Creator"" impressed me with its use of the $80 million budget. The cinematography was nothing short of remarkable, reminding me of the visual flair seen in ""Blade Runner"" ""Elysium"", ""I, Robot"" and ""A. I."" The world-building was immersive, creating a believable and lived-in environment that drew me in.The performances, particularly the dynamic between Joshua and Alfie, were the highlights of the film for me. Their interactions brought depth to the story, and I found myself genuinely invested in their journey. However, as the plot progressed, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment.The story, which began with promise, started to unravel. The pacing felt rushed, and the plot became increasingly predictable. I noticed glaring plot holes that were hard to overlook, and the narrative lacked the depth I had hoped for. The ambitious theme of AI's humanity, which initially seemed thought-provoking, was undermined by the film's inability to maintain coherence.While I appreciated the technical brilliance of the film, including the special effects and sound design, the script was a letdown. It was as if the movie wanted to say something profound about AI and humanity but ended up glossing over these complex themes, opting instead for a more superficial treatment.The characters, aside from Joshua, felt one-dimensional. I struggled to connect with them emotionally, this emotional disconnect was particularly evident in the portrayal of the AI characters, including Alfie, who, despite being central to the story, lacked the depth to make their plight resonate with me.While ""The Creator"" started off with great potential, it ultimately left me feeling underwhelmed. The film excelled in its visual storytelling but fell short in its narrative execution. It was a visually captivating experience, but the lack of emotional depth and narrative coherence made it a disappointing outing for me. I walked out of the theater feeling that the movie, despite its grand aspirations, missed the mark in delivering a fully engaging and thought-provoking sci-fi experience. It could have been a masterpiece, but a missed opportunity at best."
"The Creator","FeastMode","28 September 2023",410,"Sigh. As a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was looking forward to this new original stand-alone sci-fi movie. And I left fully disappointed. It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie. It could not get me engaged or invested, which is not a difficult task for someone who loves movie as much as I do.(1 viewing, early access screening UltraScreen 9/27/2023)"
"The Creator","kgprophet","29 September 2023",510,"Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick ""The Gray Man"". ""Creator"" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in ""The Manchurian"". Or the chosen kid in ""The Last Airbender"". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in ""Willow"". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In ""Creator"", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of ""Chappie"" with a robot police force. It could also resemble ""Elysium"", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, ""Apocalypse Now""-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish ""assassin turned compassionate"" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go ""Huh?"" ""What?"". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping on the ""A. I."" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words ""Artificial Intelligence"" and ""A. I."" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making ""Rogue One: A Star Wars story"". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10."
"The Creator","Jim_Screechy","17 November 2023",510,"I watched this from start to finish without being drawn into the story at any point.I think John Washington is miscast here, I had the same exact experience when i watched Tenet... found myself very disconnected as I he didn't seem to make a proper connection with the role he was portraying.That is not to say the film isn't without issues. They have been fairly well documented by other reviewers so I'll not labour the points here.My main issue is with the lack of emotional involvment with the characters. The film measures zero on the emtional richter scale, but more, the screenplay just doesn't manage to get you excited or involved with anything that is unfolding. Additionally, the characters seem to have little connection to each other. In fact it is only at the end of the movie that Joshua and Alphie seem to have any tangible emotional cohesion.Contrast this with The Golden Child 1986 where Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell and the connection he makes to The Golden Child played by J. L. Reate. Here you can see what a great connection is established on screen and the massive difference in outcome it produces. Both films have two similar sets of pairings in almost identical scenarios with a stark contrast in outcome.Anyway, for me the film was a big dissapointment, I can't say John David Washington was the cause of this since the Movie has many other problematic aspects, but the ones I've mentioned were particularly significant for me.5/10 sadly."
"The Creator","davemanson","11 October 2023",410,"With stunning visuals reminiscent of Blade Runner and the more recent Rouge One this movie is stunning to look at. Unfortunately the script falls far short of living up to its inspired cinematography. It's full of plot holes and cringe worthy moments from it's extremely one dimensional villains. The plot twist are telegraphed from miles away and there are no real surprises to be had. Everything plays out exactly like you would expect it to. Which is a shame. The look and mood of this film is almost enough to save it. But in the end it falls flat and its potential is wasted. See it for the visuals. Forget it for its script."
"The Creator","kevin_robbins","30 September 2023",610,"My wife and I caught The Creator (2023) in theaters last night. The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once."
"The Creator","Lomax343","28 September 2023",610,"Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity."
"The Creator","alex_with_a_P","1 October 2023",410,"AI is such a rich topic, it can be explored from any kind of angles but this movie decided to use it only as a prop. The AI people are just stand-ins for oppressed people X. None of the AI people are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!), which is one of many advantages machines would have over humans. The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and in a better way.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Awkward change of tones, a weird plot structure with constant flashbacks, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas at play. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the 135min runtime, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to another.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country where the story takes place doesn't have military or a defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers will only be used for a door. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. The last action set piece in particular is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices. Next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. Mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, those have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their task of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing interesting. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. And I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only aesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame."
"The Creator","ethanbresnett","29 September 2023",710,"The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill.It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless.The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film.There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid.Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though."

Absolutely stunning work from director Gareth Edwards and cinematographer Oren Soffer. Shot on a Sony FX3 and on location. Impressive. From color grades, shots and VFX...all top notch. A visual spectacle.Although Gareth Edwards pulls through visually, he fails miserably on the storyline. The amount of times my party sat there and looked at each other saying ""wait, what? Why?"" was too much to count. Things didnt add up and begs the audience to question many things. As if Edwards was just trying to get to an ending rather than build the story. Creating that tension or closeness between ai and humans was lacking.John Washington's mono tone, emotionless acting contributed to that disconnect. The exact ""read off the script"" acting we saw in Tenet. How he got this role is mind blowing and nepotism at its finest. His performance was only saved by child actor Madeleine Voyles, who was great. Few other questionable casting decisions, you'll see if you choose to not wait for the stream (the soccer mom playing a ruthless captain)All in all, this film was entertaining at the very least. Could have been awesome as i love how rogue one was done and im not a star wars fanatic.Worth the ticket? Eh yea not bad but definitely not a rewatch. Oh and ill never watch anything with John Washington again lol."
"The Creator","RussHog","1 January 2024",810,"My friend told me if I saw this in theaters some of the gaping plot holes would stand out more - but as it is I saw it at home and frankly I could care less if there were some plot holes this is a very good film with incredible world building.It tells the story of human v AI and our hero is a former soldier who is sent to track down the AI's ultimate weapon. Turns out the weapon is a child AI - who may or may not have the secret to his seemingly dead wife's location - and now our hero betrays his people to keep the AI safe and try to find his wife.His journey with the AI takes him deep into the heart of this world, and he eventually grows to care for the AI and rebels against his own people. It may sound cliche, but these kinds of stories need to be told again and again.By no stretch of the imagination is this corny like Avatar, this was a very good by the numbers sci-fi movie. Well acted, great special effects, good action scenes, and a big heart with a cool final showdown.Def recommended, too bad I didn't watch this in theaters."
"The Creator","Darksidecrew","28 September 2023",NA,"This new sci-fi film from Gareth Edwards (Rogue One) was made for $80 million but looks like $350 million on screen. It's a global epic on a massive scale. This is how I like films to look, I think it was probably shot on digital but they've made it look like it was shot on film. It does have shades of Terminator, Blade Runner and even Terrence Malick but it also brings some new dimensions to some classic themes. Not only the craftsmanship but the acting is also top notch in this fully immersive tale. It moves very quickly which will help you get past sone story logistics that might crumble on closer examination. A superb effort that leaves the glossy soulless and often brainless blockbusters of recent decades in the dust. A quality film that I recommend supporting in the theaters."

"The Creator","nscoby93","29 September 2023",310,"That is literally all that comes to mind a disappointment. Going in, I genuinely wanted to like this movie. I mean the director of Rogue One doing a standalone new title sci-fi film. What could go wrong? Well, apparently, everything.Let me get through the positives because that's a short list. Good acting, a great concept, and an interesting world... um, that's it.So what's bad about this film? Well, literally everything else. The story is a mess and told equally as messy. The film is convulted and tries so hard to appear deep, intelligent, and emotional, yet it's all surface and is very plain to see how empty it truly is. Unfortunately, Hans Zimmers score does nothing here as the music just didn't stand out, so I was surprised to see that he composed the music.But I think what bothered me the most about this film is that it felt like a more annoying version of Avatar. Gareth Edward's, in my opinion, like James Cameron, shows absolutely no discretion on whom the audience should side with. It all comes off as manipulation and extremely biased. So humans bad, aliens good, turns into America/Western Culture bad, and New Asia/Eastern Culture good.There is no character on the side of the Americans aside from John David Washington's character who is ""good"" or likeable but on the side of the robots they are all victims and the people of New Asia are victims of the oppressive and evil Americans. Who are basically painted as this worlds version of the Empire. They even have a deadly space station. While the robots are the Rebel Alliance doing what they can to fight this evil.So obviously as a viewer and decent human being I won't side with the Americans but the film does nothing to prove to me these robots are the victims that Gareth Edward's so desperately wants me to believe. In fact, there's a sequence that proves to me the opposite that some of these robots will kill their own people to protect this child who is essentially a Christ like figure to the robots. There is absolutely no unbiased look at both sides in this Vietnam like conflict.Then, at the end of everything, the explanation as to the reason for this war is absolutely moronic, I'd say what it is, but that's touching on spoiler territory.The movie explains nothing in the way of what this AI is or how it became ""sentient,"" etc. Also, if these robots are so peaceful and innocent, then why not make an attempt at peace? But that wouldn't happen because America is evil and dead set on destroying all AI consciousness, so any peacetalks would undoubtedly fail. Edward's here expects the audience to take everything at face value and not question anything. Which is exactly what the liberal mind expects from you, so I shouldn't be surprised. Now, I wouldn't say Gareth Edward's is a liberal as I don't know the man, but he's playing with liberal ideologies.Then, the movie tries to be a social commentary on war, which fails miserable because it conflicts with the notion of the robots being all innocent victims. Essentially, the message being all war is unjust, and the ones who suffer the most are the innocent who get caught in the crossfire.So if this film truly wanted to show that war is the real enemy, then don't paint one side as innocent victims and paint the other as cruel, oppressive aggressors. Instead, put in some effort and show that both sides aren't innocent that both sides have done evil to one another.Finally the film is no where near as beautiful as trailers made it out to look, but I'm going to be honest here and say that's most likely due to the fact we watched this film in a crap auditorium. So, hopefully, upon a second viewing, which I do plan on having, it'll be with a better projector and screen. But also so much of this movie took place at night, which I could not understand why. Perhaps so they didn't have to show so much? I have no clue. The action, I guess, looked good, but I just didn't care for what was happening in it.Anyway, I will close things here and say I'm sure a great many people would disagree with me, but that's fine. These are the issues I had with this film, and they are simply my opinions. If you liked this movie, then great. I'm happy for you, but I am just genuinely disappointed. Though, after seeing the film, I can understand why it has mixed scores.IMDb: 3/10
Letterboxd: 2/5Watched in Theaters."
"The Creator","Xstal","2 October 2023",510,"As the opening kicks off there's expectations, that the film that's being screened has firm foundations, and to be fair it's a good start, rise of machines is at its heart, as well as difference, evolving change and diverse nations. There are hints of lots of things you've seen before, wars of stars and running blades are all top drawer, but once the façade has been cracked, you'll feel as though you're being hacked, as the pace turns to a saunter, and starts to bore. At the end you'll find the steam has all escaped, that the barrel comes so close to being scraped, an apocalypse of ages, just another war that rages, you're disappointed as you leave, and your coats draped."
"The Creator","benjaminskylerhill","28 September 2023",910,"Gareth Edwards proves himself to be an astoundingly brilliant director with The Creator, as he crafts a visual and auditory world rich with layers of detail, and characters that we quickly understand and naturally grow over the course of the story.He made an $80 million movie that looks like it cost at least twice that. This cost less than half of what Thor: Love and Thunder cost. Let that sink in.Edwards shows he's a better director than writer, as the film is far from original, borrowing concepts and themes from plenty of old classic sci-fi stories. And it's also burdened with some clunky dialogue and rushed, convenient crucial plot points.Yeah, it's imperfect. But it's made with a confidence and care that goes beyond the degree of admirable. It's an earnest expression of love, redemption, sacrifice, and forgiveness put out by a filmmaker who really cares for the characters whose story he's telling.It's a work of art that, even with its flaws, deserves to be seen."
"The Creator","FixedYourEnding","17 November 2023",410,"This is going to be an unpopular review, I know. Maybe I was in the wrong mood coming into this movie, but I turned it off after 25 minutes, couldn't stand it anymore. The whole premise of American white males are constant war-mongers and do not understand progress. If you are an African American you *might* be ok, it helps if you are hurt or imperfect in some other way, if you are a minority then you should be protected and saved, etc etc.The story as a whole makes little sense and it is remains incoherent with empty dialogues and mediocre acting. Why bombs, why the war, it is not explained and when those questions are asked they reply is some sort of a joke, such as ""they are here for our jobs"". Also not explained why would someone remove his prosthetic arm before going to the pool but not his leg. Whatever.The only redeemable quality for this movie is the production value and the almost next-gen gaming-like scenario and photography. I guess if you can ignore everything else, and just look at the imagery you might enjoy it. I personally needed a little more, or actually quite a lot more.This is another polarizing creation. I fell on the ""don't like it"" side, two thumbs down for me. Looks like writers were on strike but CGI was on sale. Exact score: 44 / 100."
"The Creator","masonsaul","28 September 2023",810,"The Creator is an all too rare piece of original epic sci-fi that's built on very familiar foundations and uses them to create something that's as visually exciting as it is emotionally investing, completely unafraid to show American military might for the soulless monster it is.John David Washington plays his reluctant father figure in terrific fashion, closed off at first but those barriers are all successfully worn down by the end. In her screen debut Madeleine Yuna Voyles is amazing, adorable and undoubtedly the main reason any of this works on an emotional level.Supporting them is Ken Watanabe being as effortlessly stoic as always and Allison Janney as an antagonist with a solid amount of depth all thanks to just one scene which efficiently explains her viewpoint in a believable fashion but she's also just plain ruthless in her relentless pursuit.Gareth Edwards once again proves he doesn't need established franchises to create epic imagery or fascinating worlds on a blockbuster scale. Between the stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser & Oren Soffer and the ridiculously impressive CG it outdoes the majority of the competition on a fraction of the cost.Uncharacteristically for Gareth Edwards there's a fair few needle drops early on, the choices can be obvious but always effective and the music by Hans Zimmer is solid. It's mostly just fine up until the third act where it really comes to life and avoids feeling wasted."
"The Creator","CANpatbuck3664","20 October 2023",710,"Starting my review of the creator with some comments on the acting, I'm surprised at how meteoric John David Washington's rise to the top has been. He's a good actor for sure but he's not just ascending the staircase, he's jumping a few steps at a time. He's anchoring the Creator as our protagonist Joshua. I think he's good in the movie, he's brooding for what feels like most of the run time but when he's given a chance to either be funny in short bursts or vulnerable near the end, he gets the job done. Madeleine Yuna Voyles is fine as Alphie, she accomplishes what's required in any given scene and by the end of the movie, she does what she can in regards to selling the bond her character has with Joshua. It's hard to deliver a noteworthy performance as a child actor/actress and she's better than passable. I keep waiting for the Gemma Chan's breakout role but this is one of her better performances as Maya. She has chemistry with Washington but she's given little to do on her own. She's appropriately cast and she sticks the landing in her part. My two favourite performances were from the veteran members of the supporting cast in Ken Watanabe and Allison Janney as Harun and Colonel Howell respectively. Janney pushes the envelope just far enough without descending into being a cartoon character, her character's palpable hatred for the Simulants creates tension and the amount of disdain she conveys through just a look is impressive. Watanabe brings strength to Harun when he needs to but there's also a lot of warmth when his character is bonding with Alphie.Despite some solid work from the cast overall, I'd bet what's probably going to draw your attention in the marketing material for The Creator is the design of this dystopian world and how the war between humans and A. I. dazzles on the big screen. Gareth Edwards and his team weren't working with pennies but this is as impressive of a display for a science fiction movie that I've seen in quite a while. The cinematography is fantastic, the character design of the robots evoked Neil Blomkamp's work for me in the best way without ripping it off and the action set pieces are memorable enough to hold your interest. The movie is just as fantastical (or grounded depending on your opinion on the future of artificial intelligence) as any other sci-fi epic, but there's a beautiful mix of real imagination that keeps the movie grounded just enough that you can still take it seriously. I found it disarming that it was so excellently realized and even if you aren't enthralled by the story, The Creator is still a delight from a visual perspective.I would describe The Creator as story driven as opposed to character driven but we spend enough time with Joshua, Alphie and their friends and enemies to get to know them. I liked the work done on the characters but I wasn't emotionally invested in whether Josh and Maya were going to reunite or if Alphie would make it away safely. I don't want to point the finger at the scriptwriters or the creative team, I was left wondering how much of this movie had been cut out and left on the cutting room floor. Scenes normally required to get us to invest in some of these relationships (e.g. Josh & Alfie, Josh & Shipley or Colonel Howell & McBride) felt like they were missing to me. I don't want to complain about the run time because The Creator isn't a short movie but I was left wondering if they cleaved off a little more than they should have.My most prominent problem with The Creator was how easy to guess the overall arc of the plot was. I didn't discern what it was going to do minute by minute but you can get where the story will start, advance to and finish largely from the trailer. There are some surprises here and there but if you zoom out and observe the macro progression of the plot, this ground has been covered before. Cliche seems a little harsh of a description but The Creator still lacks something bold in where it decides to venture and I was a little disappointed by that.The Creator really falls between a 7-8 for me but this is one of the rare situations where I'm going to round down. The film is still a spectacle and if you can get over that the plot is a little recycled in certain respects, there's a lot here to enjoy. Gareth Edwards and his team deserve kudos for making The Creator a worthy theatre experience. But I still wasn't blown-away by this movie and I wanted it to really kick into the next gear to get past the 8/10 mark. The Creator is a solid science fiction adventure that is worth checking out on the biggest screen you can but outside of it's CGI and visual sensibilities, I don't think it will have the staying power to make the huge impact it's clearly swinging for."
"The Creator","Imshortok06","30 September 2023",510,"You know a movie is bad when you take your Asian immigrant dad to go watch it with you and the first thing he says after watching it is ""Okay, which communist wrote this?!"" The movie's message seemed to be America: bad; military: bad; Asia: good. And there didn't seem to be any compelling reason to root for the robots other than the fact that the kid was cute and the other AI were poor villagers. It seems to me that in order for a movie to be good, the message should be complex and universally compelling. I didn't get what the message was, other than what I previously stated. Literally every bad guy was white and American. It's either very biased or very patronizing. On the other hand, I did think the actors did a good job, and the cinematography was outstanding."
"The Creator","DanTheMan2150AD","28 September 2023",710,"7 years on from his last big screen venture with the phenomenal Rogue One, The Creator isn't quite the comeback I had hoped for director Gareth Edwards. Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid ""simulants"", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic."
"The Creator","TheVictoriousV","1 October 2023",510,"When the trailer for The Creator came out, I basically became a Facebook Disney fangirl but, like, the opposite.I was all ""OMGOMG it's a big Hollywood sci-fi movie but, like, it's made by a director with a voice and... Get this... it's based on ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No really, they FINALLY remade/rebooted/did a sequel to NOT A DAMN THING!! OMGOMG, I've waited my whole life for originality! TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!""Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be ""huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot. Some of these images are worthy of the pages of Simon Stålenhag.Here's hoping Edwards someday adapts some of his tales."
"The Creator","poseyfan","29 September 2023",710,"This is a lesson to the movie industry on how to use a budget. 80 million dollars was used splendidly. The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects. AND filmmakers everywhere should learn how a budget should be used."
"The Creator","prberg2","30 September 2023",510,"Oh, I really wanted to like this movie. Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important ""weapon/creation""? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way."
"The Creator","BA_Harrison","27 September 2023",510,"The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb."
"The Creator","weraqs","25 November 2023",710,"Walking into the theater, my expectations were a mix of excitement and curiosity, especially given the film's intriguing take on AI.From the get-go, ""The Creator"" impressed me with its use of the $80 million budget. The cinematography was nothing short of remarkable, reminding me of the visual flair seen in ""Blade Runner"" ""Elysium"", ""I, Robot"" and ""A. I."" The world-building was immersive, creating a believable and lived-in environment that drew me in.The performances, particularly the dynamic between Joshua and Alfie, were the highlights of the film for me. Their interactions brought depth to the story, and I found myself genuinely invested in their journey. However, as the plot progressed, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment.The story, which began with promise, started to unravel. The pacing felt rushed, and the plot became increasingly predictable. I noticed glaring plot holes that were hard to overlook, and the narrative lacked the depth I had hoped for. The ambitious theme of AI's humanity, which initially seemed thought-provoking, was undermined by the film's inability to maintain coherence.While I appreciated the technical brilliance of the film, including the special effects and sound design, the script was a letdown. It was as if the movie wanted to say something profound about AI and humanity but ended up glossing over these complex themes, opting instead for a more superficial treatment.The characters, aside from Joshua, felt one-dimensional. I struggled to connect with them emotionally, this emotional disconnect was particularly evident in the portrayal of the AI characters, including Alfie, who, despite being central to the story, lacked the depth to make their plight resonate with me.While ""The Creator"" started off with great potential, it ultimately left me feeling underwhelmed. The film excelled in its visual storytelling but fell short in its narrative execution. It was a visually captivating experience, but the lack of emotional depth and narrative coherence made it a disappointing outing for me. I walked out of the theater feeling that the movie, despite its grand aspirations, missed the mark in delivering a fully engaging and thought-provoking sci-fi experience. It could have been a masterpiece, but a missed opportunity at best."
"The Creator","FeastMode","28 September 2023",410,"Sigh. As a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was looking forward to this new original stand-alone sci-fi movie. And I left fully disappointed. It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie. It could not get me engaged or invested, which is not a difficult task for someone who loves movie as much as I do.(1 viewing, early access screening UltraScreen 9/27/2023)"
"The Creator","kgprophet","29 September 2023",510,"Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick ""The Gray Man"". ""Creator"" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in ""The Manchurian"". Or the chosen kid in ""The Last Airbender"". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in ""Willow"". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In ""Creator"", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of ""Chappie"" with a robot police force. It could also resemble ""Elysium"", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, ""Apocalypse Now""-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish ""assassin turned compassionate"" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go ""Huh?"" ""What?"". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping on the ""A. I."" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words ""Artificial Intelligence"" and ""A. I."" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making ""Rogue One: A Star Wars story"". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10."
"The Creator","Jim_Screechy","17 November 2023",510,"I watched this from start to finish without being drawn into the story at any point.I think John Washington is miscast here, I had the same exact experience when i watched Tenet... found myself very disconnected as I he didn't seem to make a proper connection with the role he was portraying.That is not to say the film isn't without issues. They have been fairly well documented by other reviewers so I'll not labour the points here.My main issue is with the lack of emotional involvment with the characters. The film measures zero on the emtional richter scale, but more, the screenplay just doesn't manage to get you excited or involved with anything that is unfolding. Additionally, the characters seem to have little connection to each other. In fact it is only at the end of the movie that Joshua and Alphie seem to have any tangible emotional cohesion.Contrast this with The Golden Child 1986 where Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell and the connection he makes to The Golden Child played by J. L. Reate. Here you can see what a great connection is established on screen and the massive difference in outcome it produces. Both films have two similar sets of pairings in almost identical scenarios with a stark contrast in outcome.Anyway, for me the film was a big dissapointment, I can't say John David Washington was the cause of this since the Movie has many other problematic aspects, but the ones I've mentioned were particularly significant for me.5/10 sadly."
"The Creator","davemanson","11 October 2023",410,"With stunning visuals reminiscent of Blade Runner and the more recent Rouge One this movie is stunning to look at. Unfortunately the script falls far short of living up to its inspired cinematography. It's full of plot holes and cringe worthy moments from it's extremely one dimensional villains. The plot twist are telegraphed from miles away and there are no real surprises to be had. Everything plays out exactly like you would expect it to. Which is a shame. The look and mood of this film is almost enough to save it. But in the end it falls flat and its potential is wasted. See it for the visuals. Forget it for its script."
"The Creator","kevin_robbins","30 September 2023",610,"My wife and I caught The Creator (2023) in theaters last night. The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once."
"The Creator","Lomax343","28 September 2023",610,"Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity."
"The Creator","alex_with_a_P","1 October 2023",410,"AI is such a rich topic, it can be explored from any kind of angles but this movie decided to use it only as a prop. The AI people are just stand-ins for oppressed people X. None of the AI people are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!), which is one of many advantages machines would have over humans. The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and in a better way.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Awkward change of tones, a weird plot structure with constant flashbacks, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas at play. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the 135min runtime, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to another.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country where the story takes place doesn't have military or a defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers will only be used for a door. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. The last action set piece in particular is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices. Next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. Mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, those have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their task of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing interesting. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. And I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only aesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame."
"The Creator","ethanbresnett","29 September 2023",710,"The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill.It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless.The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film.There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid.Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though."

Absolutely stunning work from director Gareth Edwards and cinematographer Oren Soffer. Shot on a Sony FX3 and on location. Impressive. From color grades, shots and VFX...all top notch. A visual spectacle.Although Gareth Edwards pulls through visually, he fails miserably on the storyline. The amount of times my party sat there and looked at each other saying ""wait, what? Why?"" was too much to count. Things didnt add up and begs the audience to question many things. As if Edwards was just trying to get to an ending rather than build the story. Creating that tension or closeness between ai and humans was lacking.John Washington's mono tone, emotionless acting contributed to that disconnect. The exact ""read off the script"" acting we saw in Tenet. How he got this role is mind blowing and nepotism at its finest. His performance was only saved by child actor Madeleine Voyles, who was great. Few other questionable casting decisions, you'll see if you choose to not wait for the stream (the soccer mom playing a ruthless captain)All in all, this film was entertaining at the very least. Could have been awesome as i love how rogue one was done and im not a star wars fanatic.Worth the ticket? Eh yea not bad but definitely not a rewatch. Oh and ill never watch anything with John Washington again lol."
"The Creator","RussHog","1 January 2024",810,"My friend told me if I saw this in theaters some of the gaping plot holes would stand out more - but as it is I saw it at home and frankly I could care less if there were some plot holes this is a very good film with incredible world building.It tells the story of human v AI and our hero is a former soldier who is sent to track down the AI's ultimate weapon. Turns out the weapon is a child AI - who may or may not have the secret to his seemingly dead wife's location - and now our hero betrays his people to keep the AI safe and try to find his wife.His journey with the AI takes him deep into the heart of this world, and he eventually grows to care for the AI and rebels against his own people. It may sound cliche, but these kinds of stories need to be told again and again.By no stretch of the imagination is this corny like Avatar, this was a very good by the numbers sci-fi movie. Well acted, great special effects, good action scenes, and a big heart with a cool final showdown.Def recommended, too bad I didn't watch this in theaters."
"The Creator","Darksidecrew","28 September 2023",NA,"This new sci-fi film from Gareth Edwards (Rogue One) was made for $80 million but looks like $350 million on screen. It's a global epic on a massive scale. This is how I like films to look, I think it was probably shot on digital but they've made it look like it was shot on film. It does have shades of Terminator, Blade Runner and even Terrence Malick but it also brings some new dimensions to some classic themes. Not only the craftsmanship but the acting is also top notch in this fully immersive tale. It moves very quickly which will help you get past sone story logistics that might crumble on closer examination. A superb effort that leaves the glossy soulless and often brainless blockbusters of recent decades in the dust. A quality film that I recommend supporting in the theaters."

"The Creator","nscoby93","29 September 2023",310,"That is literally all that comes to mind a disappointment. Going in, I genuinely wanted to like this movie. I mean the director of Rogue One doing a standalone new title sci-fi film. What could go wrong? Well, apparently, everything.Let me get through the positives because that's a short list. Good acting, a great concept, and an interesting world... um, that's it.So what's bad about this film? Well, literally everything else. The story is a mess and told equally as messy. The film is convulted and tries so hard to appear deep, intelligent, and emotional, yet it's all surface and is very plain to see how empty it truly is. Unfortunately, Hans Zimmers score does nothing here as the music just didn't stand out, so I was surprised to see that he composed the music.But I think what bothered me the most about this film is that it felt like a more annoying version of Avatar. Gareth Edward's, in my opinion, like James Cameron, shows absolutely no discretion on whom the audience should side with. It all comes off as manipulation and extremely biased. So humans bad, aliens good, turns into America/Western Culture bad, and New Asia/Eastern Culture good.There is no character on the side of the Americans aside from John David Washington's character who is ""good"" or likeable but on the side of the robots they are all victims and the people of New Asia are victims of the oppressive and evil Americans. Who are basically painted as this worlds version of the Empire. They even have a deadly space station. While the robots are the Rebel Alliance doing what they can to fight this evil.So obviously as a viewer and decent human being I won't side with the Americans but the film does nothing to prove to me these robots are the victims that Gareth Edward's so desperately wants me to believe. In fact, there's a sequence that proves to me the opposite that some of these robots will kill their own people to protect this child who is essentially a Christ like figure to the robots. There is absolutely no unbiased look at both sides in this Vietnam like conflict.Then, at the end of everything, the explanation as to the reason for this war is absolutely moronic, I'd say what it is, but that's touching on spoiler territory.The movie explains nothing in the way of what this AI is or how it became ""sentient,"" etc. Also, if these robots are so peaceful and innocent, then why not make an attempt at peace? But that wouldn't happen because America is evil and dead set on destroying all AI consciousness, so any peacetalks would undoubtedly fail. Edward's here expects the audience to take everything at face value and not question anything. Which is exactly what the liberal mind expects from you, so I shouldn't be surprised. Now, I wouldn't say Gareth Edward's is a liberal as I don't know the man, but he's playing with liberal ideologies.Then, the movie tries to be a social commentary on war, which fails miserable because it conflicts with the notion of the robots being all innocent victims. Essentially, the message being all war is unjust, and the ones who suffer the most are the innocent who get caught in the crossfire.So if this film truly wanted to show that war is the real enemy, then don't paint one side as innocent victims and paint the other as cruel, oppressive aggressors. Instead, put in some effort and show that both sides aren't innocent that both sides have done evil to one another.Finally the film is no where near as beautiful as trailers made it out to look, but I'm going to be honest here and say that's most likely due to the fact we watched this film in a crap auditorium. So, hopefully, upon a second viewing, which I do plan on having, it'll be with a better projector and screen. But also so much of this movie took place at night, which I could not understand why. Perhaps so they didn't have to show so much? I have no clue. The action, I guess, looked good, but I just didn't care for what was happening in it.Anyway, I will close things here and say I'm sure a great many people would disagree with me, but that's fine. These are the issues I had with this film, and they are simply my opinions. If you liked this movie, then great. I'm happy for you, but I am just genuinely disappointed. Though, after seeing the film, I can understand why it has mixed scores.IMDb: 3/10
Letterboxd: 2/5Watched in Theaters."
"The Creator","Xstal","2 October 2023",510,"As the opening kicks off there's expectations, that the film that's being screened has firm foundations, and to be fair it's a good start, rise of machines is at its heart, as well as difference, evolving change and diverse nations. There are hints of lots of things you've seen before, wars of stars and running blades are all top drawer, but once the façade has been cracked, you'll feel as though you're being hacked, as the pace turns to a saunter, and starts to bore. At the end you'll find the steam has all escaped, that the barrel comes so close to being scraped, an apocalypse of ages, just another war that rages, you're disappointed as you leave, and your coats draped."
"The Creator","benjaminskylerhill","28 September 2023",910,"Gareth Edwards proves himself to be an astoundingly brilliant director with The Creator, as he crafts a visual and auditory world rich with layers of detail, and characters that we quickly understand and naturally grow over the course of the story.He made an $80 million movie that looks like it cost at least twice that. This cost less than half of what Thor: Love and Thunder cost. Let that sink in.Edwards shows he's a better director than writer, as the film is far from original, borrowing concepts and themes from plenty of old classic sci-fi stories. And it's also burdened with some clunky dialogue and rushed, convenient crucial plot points.Yeah, it's imperfect. But it's made with a confidence and care that goes beyond the degree of admirable. It's an earnest expression of love, redemption, sacrifice, and forgiveness put out by a filmmaker who really cares for the characters whose story he's telling.It's a work of art that, even with its flaws, deserves to be seen."
"The Creator","FixedYourEnding","17 November 2023",410,"This is going to be an unpopular review, I know. Maybe I was in the wrong mood coming into this movie, but I turned it off after 25 minutes, couldn't stand it anymore. The whole premise of American white males are constant war-mongers and do not understand progress. If you are an African American you *might* be ok, it helps if you are hurt or imperfect in some other way, if you are a minority then you should be protected and saved, etc etc.The story as a whole makes little sense and it is remains incoherent with empty dialogues and mediocre acting. Why bombs, why the war, it is not explained and when those questions are asked they reply is some sort of a joke, such as ""they are here for our jobs"". Also not explained why would someone remove his prosthetic arm before going to the pool but not his leg. Whatever.The only redeemable quality for this movie is the production value and the almost next-gen gaming-like scenario and photography. I guess if you can ignore everything else, and just look at the imagery you might enjoy it. I personally needed a little more, or actually quite a lot more.This is another polarizing creation. I fell on the ""don't like it"" side, two thumbs down for me. Looks like writers were on strike but CGI was on sale. Exact score: 44 / 100."
"The Creator","masonsaul","28 September 2023",810,"The Creator is an all too rare piece of original epic sci-fi that's built on very familiar foundations and uses them to create something that's as visually exciting as it is emotionally investing, completely unafraid to show American military might for the soulless monster it is.John David Washington plays his reluctant father figure in terrific fashion, closed off at first but those barriers are all successfully worn down by the end. In her screen debut Madeleine Yuna Voyles is amazing, adorable and undoubtedly the main reason any of this works on an emotional level.Supporting them is Ken Watanabe being as effortlessly stoic as always and Allison Janney as an antagonist with a solid amount of depth all thanks to just one scene which efficiently explains her viewpoint in a believable fashion but she's also just plain ruthless in her relentless pursuit.Gareth Edwards once again proves he doesn't need established franchises to create epic imagery or fascinating worlds on a blockbuster scale. Between the stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser & Oren Soffer and the ridiculously impressive CG it outdoes the majority of the competition on a fraction of the cost.Uncharacteristically for Gareth Edwards there's a fair few needle drops early on, the choices can be obvious but always effective and the music by Hans Zimmer is solid. It's mostly just fine up until the third act where it really comes to life and avoids feeling wasted."
"The Creator","CANpatbuck3664","20 October 2023",710,"Starting my review of the creator with some comments on the acting, I'm surprised at how meteoric John David Washington's rise to the top has been. He's a good actor for sure but he's not just ascending the staircase, he's jumping a few steps at a time. He's anchoring the Creator as our protagonist Joshua. I think he's good in the movie, he's brooding for what feels like most of the run time but when he's given a chance to either be funny in short bursts or vulnerable near the end, he gets the job done. Madeleine Yuna Voyles is fine as Alphie, she accomplishes what's required in any given scene and by the end of the movie, she does what she can in regards to selling the bond her character has with Joshua. It's hard to deliver a noteworthy performance as a child actor/actress and she's better than passable. I keep waiting for the Gemma Chan's breakout role but this is one of her better performances as Maya. She has chemistry with Washington but she's given little to do on her own. She's appropriately cast and she sticks the landing in her part. My two favourite performances were from the veteran members of the supporting cast in Ken Watanabe and Allison Janney as Harun and Colonel Howell respectively. Janney pushes the envelope just far enough without descending into being a cartoon character, her character's palpable hatred for the Simulants creates tension and the amount of disdain she conveys through just a look is impressive. Watanabe brings strength to Harun when he needs to but there's also a lot of warmth when his character is bonding with Alphie.Despite some solid work from the cast overall, I'd bet what's probably going to draw your attention in the marketing material for The Creator is the design of this dystopian world and how the war between humans and A. I. dazzles on the big screen. Gareth Edwards and his team weren't working with pennies but this is as impressive of a display for a science fiction movie that I've seen in quite a while. The cinematography is fantastic, the character design of the robots evoked Neil Blomkamp's work for me in the best way without ripping it off and the action set pieces are memorable enough to hold your interest. The movie is just as fantastical (or grounded depending on your opinion on the future of artificial intelligence) as any other sci-fi epic, but there's a beautiful mix of real imagination that keeps the movie grounded just enough that you can still take it seriously. I found it disarming that it was so excellently realized and even if you aren't enthralled by the story, The Creator is still a delight from a visual perspective.I would describe The Creator as story driven as opposed to character driven but we spend enough time with Joshua, Alphie and their friends and enemies to get to know them. I liked the work done on the characters but I wasn't emotionally invested in whether Josh and Maya were going to reunite or if Alphie would make it away safely. I don't want to point the finger at the scriptwriters or the creative team, I was left wondering how much of this movie had been cut out and left on the cutting room floor. Scenes normally required to get us to invest in some of these relationships (e.g. Josh & Alfie, Josh & Shipley or Colonel Howell & McBride) felt like they were missing to me. I don't want to complain about the run time because The Creator isn't a short movie but I was left wondering if they cleaved off a little more than they should have.My most prominent problem with The Creator was how easy to guess the overall arc of the plot was. I didn't discern what it was going to do minute by minute but you can get where the story will start, advance to and finish largely from the trailer. There are some surprises here and there but if you zoom out and observe the macro progression of the plot, this ground has been covered before. Cliche seems a little harsh of a description but The Creator still lacks something bold in where it decides to venture and I was a little disappointed by that.The Creator really falls between a 7-8 for me but this is one of the rare situations where I'm going to round down. The film is still a spectacle and if you can get over that the plot is a little recycled in certain respects, there's a lot here to enjoy. Gareth Edwards and his team deserve kudos for making The Creator a worthy theatre experience. But I still wasn't blown-away by this movie and I wanted it to really kick into the next gear to get past the 8/10 mark. The Creator is a solid science fiction adventure that is worth checking out on the biggest screen you can but outside of it's CGI and visual sensibilities, I don't think it will have the staying power to make the huge impact it's clearly swinging for."

The movie's message seemed to be America: bad; military: bad; Asia: good. And there didn't seem to be any compelling reason to root for the robots other than the fact that the kid was cute and the other AI were poor villagers. It seems to me that in order for a movie to be good, the message should be complex and universally compelling. I didn't get what the message was, other than what I previously stated. Literally every bad guy was white and American. It's either very biased or very patronizing. On the other hand, I did think the actors did a good job, and the cinematography was outstanding."
"The Creator","DanTheMan2150AD","28 September 2023",710,"7 years on from his last big screen venture with the phenomenal Rogue One, The Creator isn't quite the comeback I had hoped for director Gareth Edwards. Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid ""simulants"", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic."

Get this... it's based on ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No really, they FINALLY remade/rebooted/did a sequel to NOT A DAMN THING!! OMGOMG, I've waited my whole life for originality! TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!""Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be ""huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot. Some of these images are worthy of the pages of Simon Stålenhag.Here's hoping Edwards someday adapts some of his tales."

The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects. AND filmmakers everywhere should learn how a budget should be used."
"The Creator","prberg2","30 September 2023",510,"Oh, I really wanted to like this movie. Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important ""weapon/creation""? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way."
"The Creator","BA_Harrison","27 September 2023",510,"The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb."
"The Creator","weraqs","25 November 2023",710,"Walking into the theater, my expectations were a mix of excitement and curiosity, especially given the film's intriguing take on AI.From the get-go, ""The Creator"" impressed me with its use of the $80 million budget. The cinematography was nothing short of remarkable, reminding me of the visual flair seen in ""Blade Runner"" ""Elysium"", ""I, Robot"" and ""A. I."" The world-building was immersive, creating a believable and lived-in environment that drew me in.The performances, particularly the dynamic between Joshua and Alfie, were the highlights of the film for me. Their interactions brought depth to the story, and I found myself genuinely invested in their journey. However, as the plot progressed, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment.The story, which began with promise, started to unravel. The pacing felt rushed, and the plot became increasingly predictable. I noticed glaring plot holes that were hard to overlook, and the narrative lacked the depth I had hoped for. The ambitious theme of AI's humanity, which initially seemed thought-provoking, was undermined by the film's inability to maintain coherence.While I appreciated the technical brilliance of the film, including the special effects and sound design, the script was a letdown. It was as if the movie wanted to say something profound about AI and humanity but ended up glossing over these complex themes, opting instead for a more superficial treatment.The characters, aside from Joshua, felt one-dimensional. I struggled to connect with them emotionally, this emotional disconnect was particularly evident in the portrayal of the AI characters, including Alfie, who, despite being central to the story, lacked the depth to make their plight resonate with me.While ""The Creator"" started off with great potential, it ultimately left me feeling underwhelmed. The film excelled in its visual storytelling but fell short in its narrative execution. It was a visually captivating experience, but the lack of emotional depth and narrative coherence made it a disappointing outing for me. I walked out of the theater feeling that the movie, despite its grand aspirations, missed the mark in delivering a fully engaging and thought-provoking sci-fi experience. It could have been a masterpiece, but a missed opportunity at best."
"The Creator","FeastMode","28 September 2023",410,"Sigh. As a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was looking forward to this new original stand-alone sci-fi movie. And I left fully disappointed. It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie. It could not get me engaged or invested, which is not a difficult task for someone who loves movie as much as I do.(1 viewing, early access screening UltraScreen 9/27/2023)"
"The Creator","kgprophet","29 September 2023",510,"Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick ""The Gray Man"". ""Creator"" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in ""The Manchurian"". Or the chosen kid in ""The Last Airbender"". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in ""Willow"". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In ""Creator"", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of ""Chappie"" with a robot police force. It could also resemble ""Elysium"", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, ""Apocalypse Now""-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish ""assassin turned compassionate"" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go ""Huh?"" ""What?"". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping on the ""A. I."" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words ""Artificial Intelligence"" and ""A. I."" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making ""Rogue One: A Star Wars story"". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10."
"The Creator","Jim_Screechy","17 November 2023",510,"I watched this from start to finish without being drawn into the story at any point.I think John Washington is miscast here, I had the same exact experience when i watched Tenet... found myself very disconnected as I he didn't seem to make a proper connection with the role he was portraying.That is not to say the film isn't without issues. They have been fairly well documented by other reviewers so I'll not labour the points here.My main issue is with the lack of emotional involvment with the characters. The film measures zero on the emtional richter scale, but more, the screenplay just doesn't manage to get you excited or involved with anything that is unfolding. Additionally, the characters seem to have little connection to each other. In fact it is only at the end of the movie that Joshua and Alphie seem to have any tangible emotional cohesion.Contrast this with The Golden Child 1986 where Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell and the connection he makes to The Golden Child played by J. L. Reate. Here you can see what a great connection is established on screen and the massive difference in outcome it produces. Both films have two similar sets of pairings in almost identical scenarios with a stark contrast in outcome.Anyway, for me the film was a big dissapointment, I can't say John David Washington was the cause of this since the Movie has many other problematic aspects, but the ones I've mentioned were particularly significant for me.5/10 sadly."
"The Creator","davemanson","11 October 2023",410,"With stunning visuals reminiscent of Blade Runner and the more recent Rouge One this movie is stunning to look at. Unfortunately the script falls far short of living up to its inspired cinematography. It's full of plot holes and cringe worthy moments from it's extremely one dimensional villains. The plot twist are telegraphed from miles away and there are no real surprises to be had. Everything plays out exactly like you would expect it to. Which is a shame. The look and mood of this film is almost enough to save it. But in the end it falls flat and its potential is wasted. See it for the visuals. Forget it for its script."
"The Creator","kevin_robbins","30 September 2023",610,"My wife and I caught The Creator (2023) in theaters last night. The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once."
"The Creator","Lomax343","28 September 2023",610,"Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity."
"The Creator","alex_with_a_P","1 October 2023",410,"AI is such a rich topic, it can be explored from any kind of angles but this movie decided to use it only as a prop. The AI people are just stand-ins for oppressed people X. None of the AI people are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!), which is one of many advantages machines would have over humans. The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and in a better way.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Awkward change of tones, a weird plot structure with constant flashbacks, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas at play. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the 135min runtime, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to another.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country where the story takes place doesn't have military or a defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers will only be used for a door. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. The last action set piece in particular is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices. Next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. Mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, those have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their task of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing interesting. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. And I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only aesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame."
"The Creator","ethanbresnett","29 September 2023",710,"The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill.It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless.The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film.There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid.Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though."

Absolutely stunning work from director Gareth Edwards and cinematographer Oren Soffer. Shot on a Sony FX3 and on location. Impressive. From color grades, shots and VFX...all top notch. A visual spectacle.Although Gareth Edwards pulls through visually, he fails miserably on the storyline. The amount of times my party sat there and looked at each other saying ""wait, what? Why?"" was too much to count. Things didnt add up and begs the audience to question many things. As if Edwards was just trying to get to an ending rather than build the story. Creating that tension or closeness between ai and humans was lacking.John Washington's mono tone, emotionless acting contributed to that disconnect. The exact ""read off the script"" acting we saw in Tenet. How he got this role is mind blowing and nepotism at its finest. His performance was only saved by child actor Madeleine Voyles, who was great. Few other questionable casting decisions, you'll see if you choose to not wait for the stream (the soccer mom playing a ruthless captain)All in all, this film was entertaining at the very least. Could have been awesome as i love how rogue one was done and im not a star wars fanatic.Worth the ticket? Eh yea not bad but definitely not a rewatch. Oh and ill never watch anything with John Washington again lol."
"The Creator","RussHog","1 January 2024",810,"My friend told me if I saw this in theaters some of the gaping plot holes would stand out more - but as it is I saw it at home and frankly I could care less if there were some plot holes this is a very good film with incredible world building.It tells the story of human v AI and our hero is a former soldier who is sent to track down the AI's ultimate weapon. Turns out the weapon is a child AI - who may or may not have the secret to his seemingly dead wife's location - and now our hero betrays his people to keep the AI safe and try to find his wife.His journey with the AI takes him deep into the heart of this world, and he eventually grows to care for the AI and rebels against his own people. It may sound cliche, but these kinds of stories need to be told again and again.By no stretch of the imagination is this corny like Avatar, this was a very good by the numbers sci-fi movie. Well acted, great special effects, good action scenes, and a big heart with a cool final showdown.Def recommended, too bad I didn't watch this in theaters."
"The Creator","Darksidecrew","28 September 2023",NA,"This new sci-fi film from Gareth Edwards (Rogue One) was made for $80 million but looks like $350 million on screen. It's a global epic on a massive scale. This is how I like films to look, I think it was probably shot on digital but they've made it look like it was shot on film. It does have shades of Terminator, Blade Runner and even Terrence Malick but it also brings some new dimensions to some classic themes. Not only the craftsmanship but the acting is also top notch in this fully immersive tale. It moves very quickly which will help you get past sone story logistics that might crumble on closer examination. A superb effort that leaves the glossy soulless and often brainless blockbusters of recent decades in the dust. A quality film that I recommend supporting in the theaters."

"The Creator","nscoby93","29 September 2023",310,"That is literally all that comes to mind a disappointment. Going in, I genuinely wanted to like this movie. I mean the director of Rogue One doing a standalone new title sci-fi film. What could go wrong? Well, apparently, everything.Let me get through the positives because that's a short list. Good acting, a great concept, and an interesting world... um, that's it.So what's bad about this film? Well, literally everything else. The story is a mess and told equally as messy. The film is convulted and tries so hard to appear deep, intelligent, and emotional, yet it's all surface and is very plain to see how empty it truly is. Unfortunately, Hans Zimmers score does nothing here as the music just didn't stand out, so I was surprised to see that he composed the music.But I think what bothered me the most about this film is that it felt like a more annoying version of Avatar. Gareth Edward's, in my opinion, like James Cameron, shows absolutely no discretion on whom the audience should side with. It all comes off as manipulation and extremely biased. So humans bad, aliens good, turns into America/Western Culture bad, and New Asia/Eastern Culture good.There is no character on the side of the Americans aside from John David Washington's character who is ""good"" or likeable but on the side of the robots they are all victims and the people of New Asia are victims of the oppressive and evil Americans. Who are basically painted as this worlds version of the Empire. They even have a deadly space station. While the robots are the Rebel Alliance doing what they can to fight this evil.So obviously as a viewer and decent human being I won't side with the Americans but the film does nothing to prove to me these robots are the victims that Gareth Edward's so desperately wants me to believe. In fact, there's a sequence that proves to me the opposite that some of these robots will kill their own people to protect this child who is essentially a Christ like figure to the robots. There is absolutely no unbiased look at both sides in this Vietnam like conflict.Then, at the end of everything, the explanation as to the reason for this war is absolutely moronic, I'd say what it is, but that's touching on spoiler territory.The movie explains nothing in the way of what this AI is or how it became ""sentient,"" etc. Also, if these robots are so peaceful and innocent, then why not make an attempt at peace? But that wouldn't happen because America is evil and dead set on destroying all AI consciousness, so any peacetalks would undoubtedly fail. Edward's here expects the audience to take everything at face value and not question anything. Which is exactly what the liberal mind expects from you, so I shouldn't be surprised. Now, I wouldn't say Gareth Edward's is a liberal as I don't know the man, but he's playing with liberal ideologies.Then, the movie tries to be a social commentary on war, which fails miserable because it conflicts with the notion of the robots being all innocent victims. Essentially, the message being all war is unjust, and the ones who suffer the most are the innocent who get caught in the crossfire.So if this film truly wanted to show that war is the real enemy, then don't paint one side as innocent victims and paint the other as cruel, oppressive aggressors. Instead, put in some effort and show that both sides aren't innocent that both sides have done evil to one another.Finally the film is no where near as beautiful as trailers made it out to look, but I'm going to be honest here and say that's most likely due to the fact we watched this film in a crap auditorium. So, hopefully, upon a second viewing, which I do plan on having, it'll be with a better projector and screen. But also so much of this movie took place at night, which I could not understand why. Perhaps so they didn't have to show so much? I have no clue. The action, I guess, looked good, but I just didn't care for what was happening in it.Anyway, I will close things here and say I'm sure a great many people would disagree with me, but that's fine. These are the issues I had with this film, and they are simply my opinions. If you liked this movie, then great. I'm happy for you, but I am just genuinely disappointed. Though, after seeing the film, I can understand why it has mixed scores.IMDb: 3/10

"The Creator","Xstal","2 October 2023",510,"As the opening kicks off there's expectations, that the film that's being screened has firm foundations, and to be fair it's a good start, rise of machines is at its heart, as well as difference, evolving change and diverse nations. There are hints of lots of things you've seen before, wars of stars and running blades are all top drawer, but once the façade has been cracked, you'll feel as though you're being hacked, as the pace turns to a saunter, and starts to bore. At the end you'll find the steam has all escaped, that the barrel comes so close to being scraped, an apocalypse of ages, just another war that rages, you're disappointed as you leave, and your coats draped."
"The Creator","benjaminskylerhill","28 September 2023",910,"Gareth Edwards proves himself to be an astoundingly brilliant director with The Creator, as he crafts a visual and auditory world rich with layers of detail, and characters that we quickly understand and naturally grow over the course of the story.He made an $80 million movie that looks like it cost at least twice that. This cost less than half of what Thor: Love and Thunder cost. Let that sink in.Edwards shows he's a better director than writer, as the film is far from original, borrowing concepts and themes from plenty of old classic sci-fi stories. And it's also burdened with some clunky dialogue and rushed, convenient crucial plot points.Yeah, it's imperfect. But it's made with a confidence and care that goes beyond the degree of admirable. It's an earnest expression of love, redemption, sacrifice, and forgiveness put out by a filmmaker who really cares for the characters whose story he's telling.It's a work of art that, even with its flaws, deserves to be seen."
"The Creator","FixedYourEnding","17 November 2023",410,"This is going to be an unpopular review, I know. Maybe I was in the wrong mood coming into this movie, but I turned it off after 25 minutes, couldn't stand it anymore. The whole premise of American white males are constant war-mongers and do not understand progress. If you are an African American you *might* be ok, it helps if you are hurt or imperfect in some other way, if you are a minority then you should be protected and saved, etc etc.The story as a whole makes little sense and it is remains incoherent with empty dialogues and mediocre acting. Why bombs, why the war, it is not explained and when those questions are asked they reply is some sort of a joke, such as ""they are here for our jobs"". Also not explained why would someone remove his prosthetic arm before going to the pool but not his leg. Whatever.The only redeemable quality for this movie is the production value and the almost next-gen gaming-like scenario and photography. I guess if you can ignore everything else, and just look at the imagery you might enjoy it. I personally needed a little more, or actually quite a lot more.This is another polarizing creation. I fell on the ""don't like it"" side, two thumbs down for me. Looks like writers were on strike but CGI was on sale. Exact score: 44 / 100."
"The Creator","masonsaul","28 September 2023",810,"The Creator is an all too rare piece of original epic sci-fi that's built on very familiar foundations and uses them to create something that's as visually exciting as it is emotionally investing, completely unafraid to show American military might for the soulless monster it is.John David Washington plays his reluctant father figure in terrific fashion, closed off at first but those barriers are all successfully worn down by the end. In her screen debut Madeleine Yuna Voyles is amazing, adorable and undoubtedly the main reason any of this works on an emotional level.Supporting them is Ken Watanabe being as effortlessly stoic as always and Allison Janney as an antagonist with a solid amount of depth all thanks to just one scene which efficiently explains her viewpoint in a believable fashion but she's also just plain ruthless in her relentless pursuit.Gareth Edwards once again proves he doesn't need established franchises to create epic imagery or fascinating worlds on a blockbuster scale. Between the stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser & Oren Soffer and the ridiculously impressive CG it outdoes the majority of the competition on a fraction of the cost.Uncharacteristically for Gareth Edwards there's a fair few needle drops early on, the choices can be obvious but always effective and the music by Hans Zimmer is solid. It's mostly just fine up until the third act where it really comes to life and avoids feeling wasted."
"The Creator","CANpatbuck3664","20 October 2023",710,"Starting my review of the creator with some comments on the acting, I'm surprised at how meteoric John David Washington's rise to the top has been. He's a good actor for sure but he's not just ascending the staircase, he's jumping a few steps at a time. He's anchoring the Creator as our protagonist Joshua. I think he's good in the movie, he's brooding for what feels like most of the run time but when he's given a chance to either be funny in short bursts or vulnerable near the end, he gets the job done. Madeleine Yuna Voyles is fine as Alphie, she accomplishes what's required in any given scene and by the end of the movie, she does what she can in regards to selling the bond her character has with Joshua. It's hard to deliver a noteworthy performance as a child actor/actress and she's better than passable. I keep waiting for the Gemma Chan's breakout role but this is one of her better performances as Maya. She has chemistry with Washington but she's given little to do on her own. She's appropriately cast and she sticks the landing in her part. My two favourite performances were from the veteran members of the supporting cast in Ken Watanabe and Allison Janney as Harun and Colonel Howell respectively. Janney pushes the envelope just far enough without descending into being a cartoon character, her character's palpable hatred for the Simulants creates tension and the amount of disdain she conveys through just a look is impressive. Watanabe brings strength to Harun when he needs to but there's also a lot of warmth when his character is bonding with Alphie.Despite some solid work from the cast overall, I'd bet what's probably going to draw your attention in the marketing material for The Creator is the design of this dystopian world and how the war between humans and A. I. dazzles on the big screen. Gareth Edwards and his team weren't working with pennies but this is as impressive of a display for a science fiction movie that I've seen in quite a while. The cinematography is fantastic, the character design of the robots evoked Neil Blomkamp's work for me in the best way without ripping it off and the action set pieces are memorable enough to hold your interest. The movie is just as fantastical (or grounded depending on your opinion on the future of artificial intelligence) as any other sci-fi epic, but there's a beautiful mix of real imagination that keeps the movie grounded just enough that you can still take it seriously. I found it disarming that it was so excellently realized and even if you aren't enthralled by the story, The Creator is still a delight from a visual perspective.I would describe The Creator as story driven as opposed to character driven but we spend enough time with Joshua, Alphie and their friends and enemies to get to know them. I liked the work done on the characters but I wasn't emotionally invested in whether Josh and Maya were going to reunite or if Alphie would make it away safely. I don't want to point the finger at the scriptwriters or the creative team, I was left wondering how much of this movie had been cut out and left on the cutting room floor. Scenes normally required to get us to invest in some of these relationships (e.g. Josh & Alfie, Josh & Shipley or Colonel Howell & McBride) felt like they were missing to me. I don't want to complain about the run time because The Creator isn't a short movie but I was left wondering if they cleaved off a little more than they should have.My most prominent problem with The Creator was how easy to guess the overall arc of the plot was. I didn't discern what it was going to do minute by minute but you can get where the story will start, advance to and finish largely from the trailer. There are some surprises here and there but if you zoom out and observe the macro progression of the plot, this ground has been covered before. Cliche seems a little harsh of a description but The Creator still lacks something bold in where it decides to venture and I was a little disappointed by that.The Creator really falls between a 7-8 for me but this is one of the rare situations where I'm going to round down. The film is still a spectacle and if you can get over that the plot is a little recycled in certain respects, there's a lot here to enjoy. Gareth Edwards and his team deserve kudos for making The Creator a worthy theatre experience. But I still wasn't blown-away by this movie and I wanted it to really kick into the next gear to get past the 8/10 mark. The Creator is a solid science fiction adventure that is worth checking out on the biggest screen you can but outside of it's CGI and visual sensibilities, I don't think it will have the staying power to make the huge impact it's clearly swinging for."
"The Creator","Imshortok06","30 September 2023",510,"You know a movie is bad when you take your Asian immigrant dad to go watch it with you and the first thing he says after watching it is ""Okay, which communist wrote this?!"" The movie's message seemed to be America: bad; military: bad; Asia: good. And there didn't seem to be any compelling reason to root for the robots other than the fact that the kid was cute and the other AI were poor villagers. It seems to me that in order for a movie to be good, the message should be complex and universally compelling. I didn't get what the message was, other than what I previously stated. Literally every bad guy was white and American. It's either very biased or very patronizing. On the other hand, I did think the actors did a good job, and the cinematography was outstanding."
"The Creator","DanTheMan2150AD","28 September 2023",710,"7 years on from his last big screen venture with the phenomenal Rogue One, The Creator isn't quite the comeback I had hoped for director Gareth Edwards. Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid ""simulants"", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic."
"The Creator","TheVictoriousV","1 October 2023",510,"When the trailer for The Creator came out, I basically became a Facebook Disney fangirl but, like, the opposite.I was all ""OMGOMG it's a big Hollywood sci-fi movie but, like, it's made by a director with a voice and... Get this... it's based on ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No really, they FINALLY remade/rebooted/did a sequel to NOT A DAMN THING!! OMGOMG, I've waited my whole life for originality! TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!""Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be ""huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot. Some of these images are worthy of the pages of Simon Stålenhag.Here's hoping Edwards someday adapts some of his tales."
"The Creator","poseyfan","29 September 2023",710,"This is a lesson to the movie industry on how to use a budget. 80 million dollars was used splendidly. The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects. AND filmmakers everywhere should learn how a budget should be used."
"The Creator","prberg2","30 September 2023",510,"Oh, I really wanted to like this movie. Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important ""weapon/creation""? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way."
"The Creator","BA_Harrison","27 September 2023",510,"The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb."
"The Creator","weraqs","25 November 2023",710,"Walking into the theater, my expectations were a mix of excitement and curiosity, especially given the film's intriguing take on AI.From the get-go, ""The Creator"" impressed me with its use of the $80 million budget. The cinematography was nothing short of remarkable, reminding me of the visual flair seen in ""Blade Runner"" ""Elysium"", ""I, Robot"" and ""A. I."" The world-building was immersive, creating a believable and lived-in environment that drew me in.The performances, particularly the dynamic between Joshua and Alfie, were the highlights of the film for me. Their interactions brought depth to the story, and I found myself genuinely invested in their journey. However, as the plot progressed, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment.The story, which began with promise, started to unravel. The pacing felt rushed, and the plot became increasingly predictable. I noticed glaring plot holes that were hard to overlook, and the narrative lacked the depth I had hoped for. The ambitious theme of AI's humanity, which initially seemed thought-provoking, was undermined by the film's inability to maintain coherence.While I appreciated the technical brilliance of the film, including the special effects and sound design, the script was a letdown. It was as if the movie wanted to say something profound about AI and humanity but ended up glossing over these complex themes, opting instead for a more superficial treatment.The characters, aside from Joshua, felt one-dimensional. I struggled to connect with them emotionally, this emotional disconnect was particularly evident in the portrayal of the AI characters, including Alfie, who, despite being central to the story, lacked the depth to make their plight resonate with me.While ""The Creator"" started off with great potential, it ultimately left me feeling underwhelmed. The film excelled in its visual storytelling but fell short in its narrative execution. It was a visually captivating experience, but the lack of emotional depth and narrative coherence made it a disappointing outing for me. I walked out of the theater feeling that the movie, despite its grand aspirations, missed the mark in delivering a fully engaging and thought-provoking sci-fi experience. It could have been a masterpiece, but a missed opportunity at best."
"The Creator","FeastMode","28 September 2023",410,"Sigh. As a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was looking forward to this new original stand-alone sci-fi movie. And I left fully disappointed. It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie. It could not get me engaged or invested, which is not a difficult task for someone who loves movie as much as I do.(1 viewing, early access screening UltraScreen 9/27/2023)"
"The Creator","kgprophet","29 September 2023",510,"Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick ""The Gray Man"". ""Creator"" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in ""The Manchurian"". Or the chosen kid in ""The Last Airbender"". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in ""Willow"". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In ""Creator"", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of ""Chappie"" with a robot police force. It could also resemble ""Elysium"", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, ""Apocalypse Now""-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish ""assassin turned compassionate"" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go ""Huh?"" ""What?"". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping on the ""A. I."" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words ""Artificial Intelligence"" and ""A. I."" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making ""Rogue One: A Star Wars story"". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10."
"The Creator","Jim_Screechy","17 November 2023",510,"I watched this from start to finish without being drawn into the story at any point.I think John Washington is miscast here, I had the same exact experience when i watched Tenet... found myself very disconnected as I he didn't seem to make a proper connection with the role he was portraying.That is not to say the film isn't without issues. They have been fairly well documented by other reviewers so I'll not labour the points here.My main issue is with the lack of emotional involvment with the characters. The film measures zero on the emtional richter scale, but more, the screenplay just doesn't manage to get you excited or involved with anything that is unfolding. Additionally, the characters seem to have little connection to each other. In fact it is only at the end of the movie that Joshua and Alphie seem to have any tangible emotional cohesion.Contrast this with The Golden Child 1986 where Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell and the connection he makes to The Golden Child played by J. L. Reate. Here you can see what a great connection is established on screen and the massive difference in outcome it produces. Both films have two similar sets of pairings in almost identical scenarios with a stark contrast in outcome.Anyway, for me the film was a big dissapointment, I can't say John David Washington was the cause of this since the Movie has many other problematic aspects, but the ones I've mentioned were particularly significant for me.5/10 sadly."
"The Creator","davemanson","11 October 2023",410,"With stunning visuals reminiscent of Blade Runner and the more recent Rouge One this movie is stunning to look at. Unfortunately the script falls far short of living up to its inspired cinematography. It's full of plot holes and cringe worthy moments from it's extremely one dimensional villains. The plot twist are telegraphed from miles away and there are no real surprises to be had. Everything plays out exactly like you would expect it to. Which is a shame. The look and mood of this film is almost enough to save it. But in the end it falls flat and its potential is wasted. See it for the visuals. Forget it for its script."
"The Creator","kevin_robbins","30 September 2023",610,"My wife and I caught The Creator (2023) in theaters last night. The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once."
"The Creator","Lomax343","28 September 2023",610,"Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity."
"The Creator","alex_with_a_P","1 October 2023",410,"AI is such a rich topic, it can be explored from any kind of angles but this movie decided to use it only as a prop. The AI people are just stand-ins for oppressed people X. None of the AI people are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!), which is one of many advantages machines would have over humans. The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and in a better way.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Awkward change of tones, a weird plot structure with constant flashbacks, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas at play. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the 135min runtime, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to another.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country where the story takes place doesn't have military or a defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers will only be used for a door. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. The last action set piece in particular is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices. Next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. Mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, those have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their task of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing interesting. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. And I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only aesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame."
"The Creator","ethanbresnett","29 September 2023",710,"The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill.It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless.The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film.There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid.Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though."

Absolutely stunning work from director Gareth Edwards and cinematographer Oren Soffer. Shot on a Sony FX3 and on location. Impressive. From color grades, shots and VFX...all top notch. A visual spectacle.Although Gareth Edwards pulls through visually, he fails miserably on the storyline. The amount of times my party sat there and looked at each other saying ""wait, what? Why?"" was too much to count. Things didnt add up and begs the audience to question many things. As if Edwards was just trying to get to an ending rather than build the story. Creating that tension or closeness between ai and humans was lacking.John Washington's mono tone, emotionless acting contributed to that disconnect. The exact ""read off the script"" acting we saw in Tenet. How he got this role is mind blowing and nepotism at its finest. His performance was only saved by child actor Madeleine Voyles, who was great. Few other questionable casting decisions, you'll see if you choose to not wait for the stream (the soccer mom playing a ruthless captain)All in all, this film was entertaining at the very least. Could have been awesome as i love how rogue one was done and im not a star wars fanatic.Worth the ticket? Eh yea not bad but definitely not a rewatch. Oh and ill never watch anything with John Washington again lol."
"The Creator","RussHog","1 January 2024",810,"My friend told me if I saw this in theaters some of the gaping plot holes would stand out more - but as it is I saw it at home and frankly I could care less if there were some plot holes this is a very good film with incredible world building.It tells the story of human v AI and our hero is a former soldier who is sent to track down the AI's ultimate weapon. Turns out the weapon is a child AI - who may or may not have the secret to his seemingly dead wife's location - and now our hero betrays his people to keep the AI safe and try to find his wife.His journey with the AI takes him deep into the heart of this world, and he eventually grows to care for the AI and rebels against his own people. It may sound cliche, but these kinds of stories need to be told again and again.By no stretch of the imagination is this corny like Avatar, this was a very good by the numbers sci-fi movie. Well acted, great special effects, good action scenes, and a big heart with a cool final showdown.Def recommended, too bad I didn't watch this in theaters."
"The Creator","Darksidecrew","28 September 2023",NA,"This new sci-fi film from Gareth Edwards (Rogue One) was made for $80 million but looks like $350 million on screen. It's a global epic on a massive scale. This is how I like films to look, I think it was probably shot on digital but they've made it look like it was shot on film. It does have shades of Terminator, Blade Runner and even Terrence Malick but it also brings some new dimensions to some classic themes. Not only the craftsmanship but the acting is also top notch in this fully immersive tale. It moves very quickly which will help you get past sone story logistics that might crumble on closer examination. A superb effort that leaves the glossy soulless and often brainless blockbusters of recent decades in the dust. A quality film that I recommend supporting in the theaters."

"The Creator","nscoby93","29 September 2023",310,"That is literally all that comes to mind a disappointment. Going in, I genuinely wanted to like this movie. I mean the director of Rogue One doing a standalone new title sci-fi film. What could go wrong? Well, apparently, everything.Let me get through the positives because that's a short list. Good acting, a great concept, and an interesting world... um, that's it.So what's bad about this film? Well, literally everything else. The story is a mess and told equally as messy. The film is convulted and tries so hard to appear deep, intelligent, and emotional, yet it's all surface and is very plain to see how empty it truly is. Unfortunately, Hans Zimmers score does nothing here as the music just didn't stand out, so I was surprised to see that he composed the music.But I think what bothered me the most about this film is that it felt like a more annoying version of Avatar. Gareth Edward's, in my opinion, like James Cameron, shows absolutely no discretion on whom the audience should side with. It all comes off as manipulation and extremely biased. So humans bad, aliens good, turns into America/Western Culture bad, and New Asia/Eastern Culture good.There is no character on the side of the Americans aside from John David Washington's character who is ""good"" or likeable but on the side of the robots they are all victims and the people of New Asia are victims of the oppressive and evil Americans. Who are basically painted as this worlds version of the Empire. They even have a deadly space station. While the robots are the Rebel Alliance doing what they can to fight this evil.So obviously as a viewer and decent human being I won't side with the Americans but the film does nothing to prove to me these robots are the victims that Gareth Edward's so desperately wants me to believe. In fact, there's a sequence that proves to me the opposite that some of these robots will kill their own people to protect this child who is essentially a Christ like figure to the robots. There is absolutely no unbiased look at both sides in this Vietnam like conflict.Then, at the end of everything, the explanation as to the reason for this war is absolutely moronic, I'd say what it is, but that's touching on spoiler territory.The movie explains nothing in the way of what this AI is or how it became ""sentient,"" etc. Also, if these robots are so peaceful and innocent, then why not make an attempt at peace? But that wouldn't happen because America is evil and dead set on destroying all AI consciousness, so any peacetalks would undoubtedly fail. Edward's here expects the audience to take everything at face value and not question anything. Which is exactly what the liberal mind expects from you, so I shouldn't be surprised. Now, I wouldn't say Gareth Edward's is a liberal as I don't know the man, but he's playing with liberal ideologies.Then, the movie tries to be a social commentary on war, which fails miserable because it conflicts with the notion of the robots being all innocent victims. Essentially, the message being all war is unjust, and the ones who suffer the most are the innocent who get caught in the crossfire.So if this film truly wanted to show that war is the real enemy, then don't paint one side as innocent victims and paint the other as cruel, oppressive aggressors. Instead, put in some effort and show that both sides aren't innocent that both sides have done evil to one another.Finally the film is no where near as beautiful as trailers made it out to look, but I'm going to be honest here and say that's most likely due to the fact we watched this film in a crap auditorium. So, hopefully, upon a second viewing, which I do plan on having, it'll be with a better projector and screen. But also so much of this movie took place at night, which I could not understand why. Perhaps so they didn't have to show so much? I have no clue. The action, I guess, looked good, but I just didn't care for what was happening in it.Anyway, I will close things here and say I'm sure a great many people would disagree with me, but that's fine. These are the issues I had with this film, and they are simply my opinions. If you liked this movie, then great. I'm happy for you, but I am just genuinely disappointed. Though, after seeing the film, I can understand why it has mixed scores.IMDb: 3/10
Letterboxd: 2/5Watched in Theaters."
"The Creator","Xstal","2 October 2023",510,"As the opening kicks off there's expectations, that the film that's being screened has firm foundations, and to be fair it's a good start, rise of machines is at its heart, as well as difference, evolving change and diverse nations. There are hints of lots of things you've seen before, wars of stars and running blades are all top drawer, but once the façade has been cracked, you'll feel as though you're being hacked, as the pace turns to a saunter, and starts to bore. At the end you'll find the steam has all escaped, that the barrel comes so close to being scraped, an apocalypse of ages, just another war that rages, you're disappointed as you leave, and your coats draped."
"The Creator","benjaminskylerhill","28 September 2023",910,"Gareth Edwards proves himself to be an astoundingly brilliant director with The Creator, as he crafts a visual and auditory world rich with layers of detail, and characters that we quickly understand and naturally grow over the course of the story.He made an $80 million movie that looks like it cost at least twice that. This cost less than half of what Thor: Love and Thunder cost. Let that sink in.Edwards shows he's a better director than writer, as the film is far from original, borrowing concepts and themes from plenty of old classic sci-fi stories. And it's also burdened with some clunky dialogue and rushed, convenient crucial plot points.Yeah, it's imperfect. But it's made with a confidence and care that goes beyond the degree of admirable. It's an earnest expression of love, redemption, sacrifice, and forgiveness put out by a filmmaker who really cares for the characters whose story he's telling.It's a work of art that, even with its flaws, deserves to be seen."
"The Creator","FixedYourEnding","17 November 2023",410,"This is going to be an unpopular review, I know. Maybe I was in the wrong mood coming into this movie, but I turned it off after 25 minutes, couldn't stand it anymore. The whole premise of American white males are constant war-mongers and do not understand progress. If you are an African American you *might* be ok, it helps if you are hurt or imperfect in some other way, if you are a minority then you should be protected and saved, etc etc.The story as a whole makes little sense and it is remains incoherent with empty dialogues and mediocre acting. Why bombs, why the war, it is not explained and when those questions are asked they reply is some sort of a joke, such as ""they are here for our jobs"". Also not explained why would someone remove his prosthetic arm before going to the pool but not his leg. Whatever.The only redeemable quality for this movie is the production value and the almost next-gen gaming-like scenario and photography. I guess if you can ignore everything else, and just look at the imagery you might enjoy it. I personally needed a little more, or actually quite a lot more.This is another polarizing creation. I fell on the ""don't like it"" side, two thumbs down for me. Looks like writers were on strike but CGI was on sale. Exact score: 44 / 100."
"The Creator","masonsaul","28 September 2023",810,"The Creator is an all too rare piece of original epic sci-fi that's built on very familiar foundations and uses them to create something that's as visually exciting as it is emotionally investing, completely unafraid to show American military might for the soulless monster it is.John David Washington plays his reluctant father figure in terrific fashion, closed off at first but those barriers are all successfully worn down by the end. In her screen debut Madeleine Yuna Voyles is amazing, adorable and undoubtedly the main reason any of this works on an emotional level.Supporting them is Ken Watanabe being as effortlessly stoic as always and Allison Janney as an antagonist with a solid amount of depth all thanks to just one scene which efficiently explains her viewpoint in a believable fashion but she's also just plain ruthless in her relentless pursuit.Gareth Edwards once again proves he doesn't need established franchises to create epic imagery or fascinating worlds on a blockbuster scale. Between the stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser & Oren Soffer and the ridiculously impressive CG it outdoes the majority of the competition on a fraction of the cost.Uncharacteristically for Gareth Edwards there's a fair few needle drops early on, the choices can be obvious but always effective and the music by Hans Zimmer is solid. It's mostly just fine up until the third act where it really comes to life and avoids feeling wasted."
"The Creator","CANpatbuck3664","20 October 2023",710,"Starting my review of the creator with some comments on the acting, I'm surprised at how meteoric John David Washington's rise to the top has been. He's a good actor for sure but he's not just ascending the staircase, he's jumping a few steps at a time. He's anchoring the Creator as our protagonist Joshua. I think he's good in the movie, he's brooding for what feels like most of the run time but when he's given a chance to either be funny in short bursts or vulnerable near the end, he gets the job done. Madeleine Yuna Voyles is fine as Alphie, she accomplishes what's required in any given scene and by the end of the movie, she does what she can in regards to selling the bond her character has with Joshua. It's hard to deliver a noteworthy performance as a child actor/actress and she's better than passable. I keep waiting for the Gemma Chan's breakout role but this is one of her better performances as Maya. She has chemistry with Washington but she's given little to do on her own. She's appropriately cast and she sticks the landing in her part. My two favourite performances were from the veteran members of the supporting cast in Ken Watanabe and Allison Janney as Harun and Colonel Howell respectively. Janney pushes the envelope just far enough without descending into being a cartoon character, her character's palpable hatred for the Simulants creates tension and the amount of disdain she conveys through just a look is impressive. Watanabe brings strength to Harun when he needs to but there's also a lot of warmth when his character is bonding with Alphie.Despite some solid work from the cast overall, I'd bet what's probably going to draw your attention in the marketing material for The Creator is the design of this dystopian world and how the war between humans and A. I. dazzles on the big screen. Gareth Edwards and his team weren't working with pennies but this is as impressive of a display for a science fiction movie that I've seen in quite a while. The cinematography is fantastic, the character design of the robots evoked Neil Blomkamp's work for me in the best way without ripping it off and the action set pieces are memorable enough to hold your interest. The movie is just as fantastical (or grounded depending on your opinion on the future of artificial intelligence) as any other sci-fi epic, but there's a beautiful mix of real imagination that keeps the movie grounded just enough that you can still take it seriously. I found it disarming that it was so excellently realized and even if you aren't enthralled by the story, The Creator is still a delight from a visual perspective.I would describe The Creator as story driven as opposed to character driven but we spend enough time with Joshua, Alphie and their friends and enemies to get to know them. I liked the work done on the characters but I wasn't emotionally invested in whether Josh and Maya were going to reunite or if Alphie would make it away safely. I don't want to point the finger at the scriptwriters or the creative team, I was left wondering how much of this movie had been cut out and left on the cutting room floor. Scenes normally required to get us to invest in some of these relationships (e.g. Josh & Alfie, Josh & Shipley or Colonel Howell & McBride) felt like they were missing to me. I don't want to complain about the run time because The Creator isn't a short movie but I was left wondering if they cleaved off a little more than they should have.My most prominent problem with The Creator was how easy to guess the overall arc of the plot was. I didn't discern what it was going to do minute by minute but you can get where the story will start, advance to and finish largely from the trailer. There are some surprises here and there but if you zoom out and observe the macro progression of the plot, this ground has been covered before. Cliche seems a little harsh of a description but The Creator still lacks something bold in where it decides to venture and I was a little disappointed by that.The Creator really falls between a 7-8 for me but this is one of the rare situations where I'm going to round down. The film is still a spectacle and if you can get over that the plot is a little recycled in certain respects, there's a lot here to enjoy. Gareth Edwards and his team deserve kudos for making The Creator a worthy theatre experience. But I still wasn't blown-away by this movie and I wanted it to really kick into the next gear to get past the 8/10 mark. The Creator is a solid science fiction adventure that is worth checking out on the biggest screen you can but outside of it's CGI and visual sensibilities, I don't think it will have the staying power to make the huge impact it's clearly swinging for."
"The Creator","Imshortok06","30 September 2023",510,"You know a movie is bad when you take your Asian immigrant dad to go watch it with you and the first thing he says after watching it is ""Okay, which communist wrote this?!"" The movie's message seemed to be America: bad; military: bad; Asia: good. And there didn't seem to be any compelling reason to root for the robots other than the fact that the kid was cute and the other AI were poor villagers. It seems to me that in order for a movie to be good, the message should be complex and universally compelling. I didn't get what the message was, other than what I previously stated. Literally every bad guy was white and American. It's either very biased or very patronizing. On the other hand, I did think the actors did a good job, and the cinematography was outstanding."
"The Creator","DanTheMan2150AD","28 September 2023",710,"7 years on from his last big screen venture with the phenomenal Rogue One, The Creator isn't quite the comeback I had hoped for director Gareth Edwards. Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid ""simulants"", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic."
"The Creator","TheVictoriousV","1 October 2023",510,"When the trailer for The Creator came out, I basically became a Facebook Disney fangirl but, like, the opposite.I was all ""OMGOMG it's a big Hollywood sci-fi movie but, like, it's made by a director with a voice and... Get this... it's based on ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No really, they FINALLY remade/rebooted/did a sequel to NOT A DAMN THING!! OMGOMG, I've waited my whole life for originality! TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!""Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be ""huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot. Some of these images are worthy of the pages of Simon Stålenhag.Here's hoping Edwards someday adapts some of his tales."
"The Creator","poseyfan","29 September 2023",710,"This is a lesson to the movie industry on how to use a budget. 80 million dollars was used splendidly. The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects. AND filmmakers everywhere should learn how a budget should be used."
"The Creator","prberg2","30 September 2023",510,"Oh, I really wanted to like this movie. Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important ""weapon/creation""? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way."
"The Creator","BA_Harrison","27 September 2023",510,"The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb."
"The Creator","weraqs","25 November 2023",710,"Walking into the theater, my expectations were a mix of excitement and curiosity, especially given the film's intriguing take on AI.From the get-go, ""The Creator"" impressed me with its use of the $80 million budget. The cinematography was nothing short of remarkable, reminding me of the visual flair seen in ""Blade Runner"" ""Elysium"", ""I, Robot"" and ""A. I."" The world-building was immersive, creating a believable and lived-in environment that drew me in.The performances, particularly the dynamic between Joshua and Alfie, were the highlights of the film for me. Their interactions brought depth to the story, and I found myself genuinely invested in their journey. However, as the plot progressed, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment.The story, which began with promise, started to unravel. The pacing felt rushed, and the plot became increasingly predictable. I noticed glaring plot holes that were hard to overlook, and the narrative lacked the depth I had hoped for. The ambitious theme of AI's humanity, which initially seemed thought-provoking, was undermined by the film's inability to maintain coherence.While I appreciated the technical brilliance of the film, including the special effects and sound design, the script was a letdown. It was as if the movie wanted to say something profound about AI and humanity but ended up glossing over these complex themes, opting instead for a more superficial treatment.The characters, aside from Joshua, felt one-dimensional. I struggled to connect with them emotionally, this emotional disconnect was particularly evident in the portrayal of the AI characters, including Alfie, who, despite being central to the story, lacked the depth to make their plight resonate with me.While ""The Creator"" started off with great potential, it ultimately left me feeling underwhelmed. The film excelled in its visual storytelling but fell short in its narrative execution. It was a visually captivating experience, but the lack of emotional depth and narrative coherence made it a disappointing outing for me. I walked out of the theater feeling that the movie, despite its grand aspirations, missed the mark in delivering a fully engaging and thought-provoking sci-fi experience. It could have been a masterpiece, but a missed opportunity at best."
"The Creator","FeastMode","28 September 2023",410,"Sigh. As a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was looking forward to this new original stand-alone sci-fi movie. And I left fully disappointed. It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie. It could not get me engaged or invested, which is not a difficult task for someone who loves movie as much as I do.(1 viewing, early access screening UltraScreen 9/27/2023)"
"The Creator","kgprophet","29 September 2023",510,"Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick ""The Gray Man"". ""Creator"" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in ""The Manchurian"". Or the chosen kid in ""The Last Airbender"". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in ""Willow"". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In ""Creator"", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of ""Chappie"" with a robot police force. It could also resemble ""Elysium"", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, ""Apocalypse Now""-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish ""assassin turned compassionate"" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go ""Huh?"" ""What?"". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping on the ""A. I."" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words ""Artificial Intelligence"" and ""A. I."" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making ""Rogue One: A Star Wars story"". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10."
"The Creator","Jim_Screechy","17 November 2023",510,"I watched this from start to finish without being drawn into the story at any point.I think John Washington is miscast here, I had the same exact experience when i watched Tenet... found myself very disconnected as I he didn't seem to make a proper connection with the role he was portraying.That is not to say the film isn't without issues. They have been fairly well documented by other reviewers so I'll not labour the points here.My main issue is with the lack of emotional involvment with the characters. The film measures zero on the emtional richter scale, but more, the screenplay just doesn't manage to get you excited or involved with anything that is unfolding. Additionally, the characters seem to have little connection to each other. In fact it is only at the end of the movie that Joshua and Alphie seem to have any tangible emotional cohesion.Contrast this with The Golden Child 1986 where Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell and the connection he makes to The Golden Child played by J. L. Reate. Here you can see what a great connection is established on screen and the massive difference in outcome it produces. Both films have two similar sets of pairings in almost identical scenarios with a stark contrast in outcome.Anyway, for me the film was a big dissapointment, I can't say John David Washington was the cause of this since the Movie has many other problematic aspects, but the ones I've mentioned were particularly significant for me.5/10 sadly."
"The Creator","davemanson","11 October 2023",410,"With stunning visuals reminiscent of Blade Runner and the more recent Rouge One this movie is stunning to look at. Unfortunately the script falls far short of living up to its inspired cinematography. It's full of plot holes and cringe worthy moments from it's extremely one dimensional villains. The plot twist are telegraphed from miles away and there are no real surprises to be had. Everything plays out exactly like you would expect it to. Which is a shame. The look and mood of this film is almost enough to save it. But in the end it falls flat and its potential is wasted. See it for the visuals. Forget it for its script."
"The Creator","kevin_robbins","30 September 2023",610,"My wife and I caught The Creator (2023) in theaters last night. The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once."
"The Creator","Lomax343","28 September 2023",610,"Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity."
"The Creator","alex_with_a_P","1 October 2023",410,"AI is such a rich topic, it can be explored from any kind of angles but this movie decided to use it only as a prop. The AI people are just stand-ins for oppressed people X. None of the AI people are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!), which is one of many advantages machines would have over humans. The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and in a better way.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Awkward change of tones, a weird plot structure with constant flashbacks, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas at play. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the 135min runtime, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to another.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country where the story takes place doesn't have military or a defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers will only be used for a door. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. The last action set piece in particular is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices. Next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. Mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, those have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their task of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing interesting. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. And I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only aesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame."
"The Creator","ethanbresnett","29 September 2023",710,"The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill.It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless.The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film.There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid.Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though."

Absolutely stunning work from director Gareth Edwards and cinematographer Oren Soffer. Shot on a Sony FX3 and on location. Impressive. From color grades, shots and VFX...all top notch. A visual spectacle.Although Gareth Edwards pulls through visually, he fails miserably on the storyline. The amount of times my party sat there and looked at each other saying ""wait, what? Why?"" was too much to count. Things didnt add up and begs the audience to question many things. As if Edwards was just trying to get to an ending rather than build the story. Creating that tension or closeness between ai and humans was lacking.John Washington's mono tone, emotionless acting contributed to that disconnect. The exact ""read off the script"" acting we saw in Tenet. How he got this role is mind blowing and nepotism at its finest. His performance was only saved by child actor Madeleine Voyles, who was great. Few other questionable casting decisions, you'll see if you choose to not wait for the stream (the soccer mom playing a ruthless captain)All in all, this film was entertaining at the very least. Could have been awesome as i love how rogue one was done and im not a star wars fanatic.Worth the ticket? Eh yea not bad but definitely not a rewatch. Oh and ill never watch anything with John Washington again lol."
"The Creator","RussHog","1 January 2024",810,"My friend told me if I saw this in theaters some of the gaping plot holes would stand out more - but as it is I saw it at home and frankly I could care less if there were some plot holes this is a very good film with incredible world building.It tells the story of human v AI and our hero is a former soldier who is sent to track down the AI's ultimate weapon. Turns out the weapon is a child AI - who may or may not have the secret to his seemingly dead wife's location - and now our hero betrays his people to keep the AI safe and try to find his wife.His journey with the AI takes him deep into the heart of this world, and he eventually grows to care for the AI and rebels against his own people. It may sound cliche, but these kinds of stories need to be told again and again.By no stretch of the imagination is this corny like Avatar, this was a very good by the numbers sci-fi movie. Well acted, great special effects, good action scenes, and a big heart with a cool final showdown.Def recommended, too bad I didn't watch this in theaters."
"The Creator","Darksidecrew","28 September 2023",NA,"This new sci-fi film from Gareth Edwards (Rogue One) was made for $80 million but looks like $350 million on screen. It's a global epic on a massive scale. This is how I like films to look, I think it was probably shot on digital but they've made it look like it was shot on film. It does have shades of Terminator, Blade Runner and even Terrence Malick but it also brings some new dimensions to some classic themes. Not only the craftsmanship but the acting is also top notch in this fully immersive tale. It moves very quickly which will help you get past sone story logistics that might crumble on closer examination. A superb effort that leaves the glossy soulless and often brainless blockbusters of recent decades in the dust. A quality film that I recommend supporting in the theaters."

"The Creator","nscoby93","29 September 2023",310,"That is literally all that comes to mind a disappointment. Going in, I genuinely wanted to like this movie. I mean the director of Rogue One doing a standalone new title sci-fi film. What could go wrong? Well, apparently, everything.Let me get through the positives because that's a short list. Good acting, a great concept, and an interesting world... um, that's it.So what's bad about this film? Well, literally everything else. The story is a mess and told equally as messy. The film is convulted and tries so hard to appear deep, intelligent, and emotional, yet it's all surface and is very plain to see how empty it truly is. Unfortunately, Hans Zimmers score does nothing here as the music just didn't stand out, so I was surprised to see that he composed the music.But I think what bothered me the most about this film is that it felt like a more annoying version of Avatar. Gareth Edward's, in my opinion, like James Cameron, shows absolutely no discretion on whom the audience should side with. It all comes off as manipulation and extremely biased. So humans bad, aliens good, turns into America/Western Culture bad, and New Asia/Eastern Culture good.There is no character on the side of the Americans aside from John David Washington's character who is ""good"" or likeable but on the side of the robots they are all victims and the people of New Asia are victims of the oppressive and evil Americans. Who are basically painted as this worlds version of the Empire. They even have a deadly space station. While the robots are the Rebel Alliance doing what they can to fight this evil.So obviously as a viewer and decent human being I won't side with the Americans but the film does nothing to prove to me these robots are the victims that Gareth Edward's so desperately wants me to believe. In fact, there's a sequence that proves to me the opposite that some of these robots will kill their own people to protect this child who is essentially a Christ like figure to the robots. There is absolutely no unbiased look at both sides in this Vietnam like conflict.Then, at the end of everything, the explanation as to the reason for this war is absolutely moronic, I'd say what it is, but that's touching on spoiler territory.The movie explains nothing in the way of what this AI is or how it became ""sentient,"" etc. Also, if these robots are so peaceful and innocent, then why not make an attempt at peace? But that wouldn't happen because America is evil and dead set on destroying all AI consciousness, so any peacetalks would undoubtedly fail. Edward's here expects the audience to take everything at face value and not question anything. Which is exactly what the liberal mind expects from you, so I shouldn't be surprised. Now, I wouldn't say Gareth Edward's is a liberal as I don't know the man, but he's playing with liberal ideologies.Then, the movie tries to be a social commentary on war, which fails miserable because it conflicts with the notion of the robots being all innocent victims. Essentially, the message being all war is unjust, and the ones who suffer the most are the innocent who get caught in the crossfire.So if this film truly wanted to show that war is the real enemy, then don't paint one side as innocent victims and paint the other as cruel, oppressive aggressors. Instead, put in some effort and show that both sides aren't innocent that both sides have done evil to one another.Finally the film is no where near as beautiful as trailers made it out to look, but I'm going to be honest here and say that's most likely due to the fact we watched this film in a crap auditorium. So, hopefully, upon a second viewing, which I do plan on having, it'll be with a better projector and screen. But also so much of this movie took place at night, which I could not understand why. Perhaps so they didn't have to show so much? I have no clue. The action, I guess, looked good, but I just didn't care for what was happening in it.Anyway, I will close things here and say I'm sure a great many people would disagree with me, but that's fine. These are the issues I had with this film, and they are simply my opinions. If you liked this movie, then great. I'm happy for you, but I am just genuinely disappointed. Though, after seeing the film, I can understand why it has mixed scores.IMDb: 3/10
Letterboxd: 2/5Watched in Theaters."
"The Creator","Xstal","2 October 2023",510,"As the opening kicks off there's expectations, that the film that's being screened has firm foundations, and to be fair it's a good start, rise of machines is at its heart, as well as difference, evolving change and diverse nations. There are hints of lots of things you've seen before, wars of stars and running blades are all top drawer, but once the façade has been cracked, you'll feel as though you're being hacked, as the pace turns to a saunter, and starts to bore. At the end you'll find the steam has all escaped, that the barrel comes so close to being scraped, an apocalypse of ages, just another war that rages, you're disappointed as you leave, and your coats draped."
"The Creator","benjaminskylerhill","28 September 2023",910,"Gareth Edwards proves himself to be an astoundingly brilliant director with The Creator, as he crafts a visual and auditory world rich with layers of detail, and characters that we quickly understand and naturally grow over the course of the story.He made an $80 million movie that looks like it cost at least twice that. This cost less than half of what Thor: Love and Thunder cost. Let that sink in.Edwards shows he's a better director than writer, as the film is far from original, borrowing concepts and themes from plenty of old classic sci-fi stories. And it's also burdened with some clunky dialogue and rushed, convenient crucial plot points.Yeah, it's imperfect. But it's made with a confidence and care that goes beyond the degree of admirable. It's an earnest expression of love, redemption, sacrifice, and forgiveness put out by a filmmaker who really cares for the characters whose story he's telling.It's a work of art that, even with its flaws, deserves to be seen."
"The Creator","FixedYourEnding","17 November 2023",410,"This is going to be an unpopular review, I know. Maybe I was in the wrong mood coming into this movie, but I turned it off after 25 minutes, couldn't stand it anymore. The whole premise of American white males are constant war-mongers and do not understand progress. If you are an African American you *might* be ok, it helps if you are hurt or imperfect in some other way, if you are a minority then you should be protected and saved, etc etc.The story as a whole makes little sense and it is remains incoherent with empty dialogues and mediocre acting. Why bombs, why the war, it is not explained and when those questions are asked they reply is some sort of a joke, such as ""they are here for our jobs"". Also not explained why would someone remove his prosthetic arm before going to the pool but not his leg. Whatever.The only redeemable quality for this movie is the production value and the almost next-gen gaming-like scenario and photography. I guess if you can ignore everything else, and just look at the imagery you might enjoy it. I personally needed a little more, or actually quite a lot more.This is another polarizing creation. I fell on the ""don't like it"" side, two thumbs down for me. Looks like writers were on strike but CGI was on sale. Exact score: 44 / 100."
"The Creator","masonsaul","28 September 2023",810,"The Creator is an all too rare piece of original epic sci-fi that's built on very familiar foundations and uses them to create something that's as visually exciting as it is emotionally investing, completely unafraid to show American military might for the soulless monster it is.John David Washington plays his reluctant father figure in terrific fashion, closed off at first but those barriers are all successfully worn down by the end. In her screen debut Madeleine Yuna Voyles is amazing, adorable and undoubtedly the main reason any of this works on an emotional level.Supporting them is Ken Watanabe being as effortlessly stoic as always and Allison Janney as an antagonist with a solid amount of depth all thanks to just one scene which efficiently explains her viewpoint in a believable fashion but she's also just plain ruthless in her relentless pursuit.Gareth Edwards once again proves he doesn't need established franchises to create epic imagery or fascinating worlds on a blockbuster scale. Between the stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser & Oren Soffer and the ridiculously impressive CG it outdoes the majority of the competition on a fraction of the cost.Uncharacteristically for Gareth Edwards there's a fair few needle drops early on, the choices can be obvious but always effective and the music by Hans Zimmer is solid. It's mostly just fine up until the third act where it really comes to life and avoids feeling wasted."
"The Creator","CANpatbuck3664","20 October 2023",710,"Starting my review of the creator with some comments on the acting, I'm surprised at how meteoric John David Washington's rise to the top has been. He's a good actor for sure but he's not just ascending the staircase, he's jumping a few steps at a time. He's anchoring the Creator as our protagonist Joshua. I think he's good in the movie, he's brooding for what feels like most of the run time but when he's given a chance to either be funny in short bursts or vulnerable near the end, he gets the job done. Madeleine Yuna Voyles is fine as Alphie, she accomplishes what's required in any given scene and by the end of the movie, she does what she can in regards to selling the bond her character has with Joshua. It's hard to deliver a noteworthy performance as a child actor/actress and she's better than passable. I keep waiting for the Gemma Chan's breakout role but this is one of her better performances as Maya. She has chemistry with Washington but she's given little to do on her own. She's appropriately cast and she sticks the landing in her part. My two favourite performances were from the veteran members of the supporting cast in Ken Watanabe and Allison Janney as Harun and Colonel Howell respectively. Janney pushes the envelope just far enough without descending into being a cartoon character, her character's palpable hatred for the Simulants creates tension and the amount of disdain she conveys through just a look is impressive. Watanabe brings strength to Harun when he needs to but there's also a lot of warmth when his character is bonding with Alphie.Despite some solid work from the cast overall, I'd bet what's probably going to draw your attention in the marketing material for The Creator is the design of this dystopian world and how the war between humans and A. I. dazzles on the big screen. Gareth Edwards and his team weren't working with pennies but this is as impressive of a display for a science fiction movie that I've seen in quite a while. The cinematography is fantastic, the character design of the robots evoked Neil Blomkamp's work for me in the best way without ripping it off and the action set pieces are memorable enough to hold your interest. The movie is just as fantastical (or grounded depending on your opinion on the future of artificial intelligence) as any other sci-fi epic, but there's a beautiful mix of real imagination that keeps the movie grounded just enough that you can still take it seriously. I found it disarming that it was so excellently realized and even if you aren't enthralled by the story, The Creator is still a delight from a visual perspective.I would describe The Creator as story driven as opposed to character driven but we spend enough time with Joshua, Alphie and their friends and enemies to get to know them. I liked the work done on the characters but I wasn't emotionally invested in whether Josh and Maya were going to reunite or if Alphie would make it away safely. I don't want to point the finger at the scriptwriters or the creative team, I was left wondering how much of this movie had been cut out and left on the cutting room floor. Scenes normally required to get us to invest in some of these relationships (e.g. Josh & Alfie, Josh & Shipley or Colonel Howell & McBride) felt like they were missing to me. I don't want to complain about the run time because The Creator isn't a short movie but I was left wondering if they cleaved off a little more than they should have.My most prominent problem with The Creator was how easy to guess the overall arc of the plot was. I didn't discern what it was going to do minute by minute but you can get where the story will start, advance to and finish largely from the trailer. There are some surprises here and there but if you zoom out and observe the macro progression of the plot, this ground has been covered before. Cliche seems a little harsh of a description but The Creator still lacks something bold in where it decides to venture and I was a little disappointed by that.The Creator really falls between a 7-8 for me but this is one of the rare situations where I'm going to round down. The film is still a spectacle and if you can get over that the plot is a little recycled in certain respects, there's a lot here to enjoy. Gareth Edwards and his team deserve kudos for making The Creator a worthy theatre experience. But I still wasn't blown-away by this movie and I wanted it to really kick into the next gear to get past the 8/10 mark. The Creator is a solid science fiction adventure that is worth checking out on the biggest screen you can but outside of it's CGI and visual sensibilities, I don't think it will have the staying power to make the huge impact it's clearly swinging for."

The movie's message seemed to be America: bad; military: bad; Asia: good. And there didn't seem to be any compelling reason to root for the robots other than the fact that the kid was cute and the other AI were poor villagers. It seems to me that in order for a movie to be good, the message should be complex and universally compelling. I didn't get what the message was, other than what I previously stated. Literally every bad guy was white and American. It's either very biased or very patronizing. On the other hand, I did think the actors did a good job, and the cinematography was outstanding."
"The Creator","DanTheMan2150AD","28 September 2023",710,"7 years on from his last big screen venture with the phenomenal Rogue One, The Creator isn't quite the comeback I had hoped for director Gareth Edwards. Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid ""simulants"", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic."

Get this... it's based on ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No really, they FINALLY remade/rebooted/did a sequel to NOT A DAMN THING!! OMGOMG, I've waited my whole life for originality! TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!""Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be ""huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot. Some of these images are worthy of the pages of Simon Stålenhag.Here's hoping Edwards someday adapts some of his tales."

The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects. AND filmmakers everywhere should learn how a budget should be used."
"The Creator","prberg2","30 September 2023",510,"Oh, I really wanted to like this movie. Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important ""weapon/creation""? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way."
"The Creator","BA_Harrison","27 September 2023",510,"The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb."
"The Creator","weraqs","25 November 2023",710,"Walking into the theater, my expectations were a mix of excitement and curiosity, especially given the film's intriguing take on AI.From the get-go, ""The Creator"" impressed me with its use of the $80 million budget. The cinematography was nothing short of remarkable, reminding me of the visual flair seen in ""Blade Runner"" ""Elysium"", ""I, Robot"" and ""A. I."" The world-building was immersive, creating a believable and lived-in environment that drew me in.The performances, particularly the dynamic between Joshua and Alfie, were the highlights of the film for me. Their interactions brought depth to the story, and I found myself genuinely invested in their journey. However, as the plot progressed, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment.The story, which began with promise, started to unravel. The pacing felt rushed, and the plot became increasingly predictable. I noticed glaring plot holes that were hard to overlook, and the narrative lacked the depth I had hoped for. The ambitious theme of AI's humanity, which initially seemed thought-provoking, was undermined by the film's inability to maintain coherence.While I appreciated the technical brilliance of the film, including the special effects and sound design, the script was a letdown. It was as if the movie wanted to say something profound about AI and humanity but ended up glossing over these complex themes, opting instead for a more superficial treatment.The characters, aside from Joshua, felt one-dimensional. I struggled to connect with them emotionally, this emotional disconnect was particularly evident in the portrayal of the AI characters, including Alfie, who, despite being central to the story, lacked the depth to make their plight resonate with me.While ""The Creator"" started off with great potential, it ultimately left me feeling underwhelmed. The film excelled in its visual storytelling but fell short in its narrative execution. It was a visually captivating experience, but the lack of emotional depth and narrative coherence made it a disappointing outing for me. I walked out of the theater feeling that the movie, despite its grand aspirations, missed the mark in delivering a fully engaging and thought-provoking sci-fi experience. It could have been a masterpiece, but a missed opportunity at best."
"The Creator","FeastMode","28 September 2023",410,"Sigh. As a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was looking forward to this new original stand-alone sci-fi movie. And I left fully disappointed. It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie. It could not get me engaged or invested, which is not a difficult task for someone who loves movie as much as I do.(1 viewing, early access screening UltraScreen 9/27/2023)"
"The Creator","kgprophet","29 September 2023",510,"Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick ""The Gray Man"". ""Creator"" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in ""The Manchurian"". Or the chosen kid in ""The Last Airbender"". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in ""Willow"". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In ""Creator"", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of ""Chappie"" with a robot police force. It could also resemble ""Elysium"", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, ""Apocalypse Now""-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish ""assassin turned compassionate"" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go ""Huh?"" ""What?"". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping on the ""A. I."" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words ""Artificial Intelligence"" and ""A. I."" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making ""Rogue One: A Star Wars story"". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10."
"The Creator","Jim_Screechy","17 November 2023",510,"I watched this from start to finish without being drawn into the story at any point.I think John Washington is miscast here, I had the same exact experience when i watched Tenet... found myself very disconnected as I he didn't seem to make a proper connection with the role he was portraying.That is not to say the film isn't without issues. They have been fairly well documented by other reviewers so I'll not labour the points here.My main issue is with the lack of emotional involvment with the characters. The film measures zero on the emtional richter scale, but more, the screenplay just doesn't manage to get you excited or involved with anything that is unfolding. Additionally, the characters seem to have little connection to each other. In fact it is only at the end of the movie that Joshua and Alphie seem to have any tangible emotional cohesion.Contrast this with The Golden Child 1986 where Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell and the connection he makes to The Golden Child played by J. L. Reate. Here you can see what a great connection is established on screen and the massive difference in outcome it produces. Both films have two similar sets of pairings in almost identical scenarios with a stark contrast in outcome.Anyway, for me the film was a big dissapointment, I can't say John David Washington was the cause of this since the Movie has many other problematic aspects, but the ones I've mentioned were particularly significant for me.5/10 sadly."
"The Creator","davemanson","11 October 2023",410,"With stunning visuals reminiscent of Blade Runner and the more recent Rouge One this movie is stunning to look at. Unfortunately the script falls far short of living up to its inspired cinematography. It's full of plot holes and cringe worthy moments from it's extremely one dimensional villains. The plot twist are telegraphed from miles away and there are no real surprises to be had. Everything plays out exactly like you would expect it to. Which is a shame. The look and mood of this film is almost enough to save it. But in the end it falls flat and its potential is wasted. See it for the visuals. Forget it for its script."
"The Creator","kevin_robbins","30 September 2023",610,"My wife and I caught The Creator (2023) in theaters last night. The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once."
"The Creator","Lomax343","28 September 2023",610,"Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity."
"The Creator","alex_with_a_P","1 October 2023",410,"AI is such a rich topic, it can be explored from any kind of angles but this movie decided to use it only as a prop. The AI people are just stand-ins for oppressed people X. None of the AI people are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!), which is one of many advantages machines would have over humans. The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and in a better way.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Awkward change of tones, a weird plot structure with constant flashbacks, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas at play. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the 135min runtime, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to another.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country where the story takes place doesn't have military or a defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers will only be used for a door. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. The last action set piece in particular is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices. Next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. Mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, those have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their task of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing interesting. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. And I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only aesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame."
"The Creator","ethanbresnett","29 September 2023",710,"The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill.It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless.The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film.There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid.Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though."

Absolutely stunning work from director Gareth Edwards and cinematographer Oren Soffer. Shot on a Sony FX3 and on location. Impressive. From color grades, shots and VFX...all top notch. A visual spectacle.Although Gareth Edwards pulls through visually, he fails miserably on the storyline. The amount of times my party sat there and looked at each other saying ""wait, what? Why?"" was too much to count. Things didnt add up and begs the audience to question many things. As if Edwards was just trying to get to an ending rather than build the story. Creating that tension or closeness between ai and humans was lacking.John Washington's mono tone, emotionless acting contributed to that disconnect. The exact ""read off the script"" acting we saw in Tenet. How he got this role is mind blowing and nepotism at its finest. His performance was only saved by child actor Madeleine Voyles, who was great. Few other questionable casting decisions, you'll see if you choose to not wait for the stream (the soccer mom playing a ruthless captain)All in all, this film was entertaining at the very least. Could have been awesome as i love how rogue one was done and im not a star wars fanatic.Worth the ticket? Eh yea not bad but definitely not a rewatch. Oh and ill never watch anything with John Washington again lol."
"The Creator","RussHog","1 January 2024",810,"My friend told me if I saw this in theaters some of the gaping plot holes would stand out more - but as it is I saw it at home and frankly I could care less if there were some plot holes this is a very good film with incredible world building.It tells the story of human v AI and our hero is a former soldier who is sent to track down the AI's ultimate weapon. Turns out the weapon is a child AI - who may or may not have the secret to his seemingly dead wife's location - and now our hero betrays his people to keep the AI safe and try to find his wife.His journey with the AI takes him deep into the heart of this world, and he eventually grows to care for the AI and rebels against his own people. It may sound cliche, but these kinds of stories need to be told again and again.By no stretch of the imagination is this corny like Avatar, this was a very good by the numbers sci-fi movie. Well acted, great special effects, good action scenes, and a big heart with a cool final showdown.Def recommended, too bad I didn't watch this in theaters."
"The Creator","Darksidecrew","28 September 2023",NA,"This new sci-fi film from Gareth Edwards (Rogue One) was made for $80 million but looks like $350 million on screen. It's a global epic on a massive scale. This is how I like films to look, I think it was probably shot on digital but they've made it look like it was shot on film. It does have shades of Terminator, Blade Runner and even Terrence Malick but it also brings some new dimensions to some classic themes. Not only the craftsmanship but the acting is also top notch in this fully immersive tale. It moves very quickly which will help you get past sone story logistics that might crumble on closer examination. A superb effort that leaves the glossy soulless and often brainless blockbusters of recent decades in the dust. A quality film that I recommend supporting in the theaters."

"The Creator","nscoby93","29 September 2023",310,"That is literally all that comes to mind a disappointment. Going in, I genuinely wanted to like this movie. I mean the director of Rogue One doing a standalone new title sci-fi film. What could go wrong? Well, apparently, everything.Let me get through the positives because that's a short list. Good acting, a great concept, and an interesting world... um, that's it.So what's bad about this film? Well, literally everything else. The story is a mess and told equally as messy. The film is convulted and tries so hard to appear deep, intelligent, and emotional, yet it's all surface and is very plain to see how empty it truly is. Unfortunately, Hans Zimmers score does nothing here as the music just didn't stand out, so I was surprised to see that he composed the music.But I think what bothered me the most about this film is that it felt like a more annoying version of Avatar. Gareth Edward's, in my opinion, like James Cameron, shows absolutely no discretion on whom the audience should side with. It all comes off as manipulation and extremely biased. So humans bad, aliens good, turns into America/Western Culture bad, and New Asia/Eastern Culture good.There is no character on the side of the Americans aside from John David Washington's character who is ""good"" or likeable but on the side of the robots they are all victims and the people of New Asia are victims of the oppressive and evil Americans. Who are basically painted as this worlds version of the Empire. They even have a deadly space station. While the robots are the Rebel Alliance doing what they can to fight this evil.So obviously as a viewer and decent human being I won't side with the Americans but the film does nothing to prove to me these robots are the victims that Gareth Edward's so desperately wants me to believe. In fact, there's a sequence that proves to me the opposite that some of these robots will kill their own people to protect this child who is essentially a Christ like figure to the robots. There is absolutely no unbiased look at both sides in this Vietnam like conflict.Then, at the end of everything, the explanation as to the reason for this war is absolutely moronic, I'd say what it is, but that's touching on spoiler territory.The movie explains nothing in the way of what this AI is or how it became ""sentient,"" etc. Also, if these robots are so peaceful and innocent, then why not make an attempt at peace? But that wouldn't happen because America is evil and dead set on destroying all AI consciousness, so any peacetalks would undoubtedly fail. Edward's here expects the audience to take everything at face value and not question anything. Which is exactly what the liberal mind expects from you, so I shouldn't be surprised. Now, I wouldn't say Gareth Edward's is a liberal as I don't know the man, but he's playing with liberal ideologies.Then, the movie tries to be a social commentary on war, which fails miserable because it conflicts with the notion of the robots being all innocent victims. Essentially, the message being all war is unjust, and the ones who suffer the most are the innocent who get caught in the crossfire.So if this film truly wanted to show that war is the real enemy, then don't paint one side as innocent victims and paint the other as cruel, oppressive aggressors. Instead, put in some effort and show that both sides aren't innocent that both sides have done evil to one another.Finally the film is no where near as beautiful as trailers made it out to look, but I'm going to be honest here and say that's most likely due to the fact we watched this film in a crap auditorium. So, hopefully, upon a second viewing, which I do plan on having, it'll be with a better projector and screen. But also so much of this movie took place at night, which I could not understand why. Perhaps so they didn't have to show so much? I have no clue. The action, I guess, looked good, but I just didn't care for what was happening in it.Anyway, I will close things here and say I'm sure a great many people would disagree with me, but that's fine. These are the issues I had with this film, and they are simply my opinions. If you liked this movie, then great. I'm happy for you, but I am just genuinely disappointed. Though, after seeing the film, I can understand why it has mixed scores.IMDb: 3/10

"The Creator","Xstal","2 October 2023",510,"As the opening kicks off there's expectations, that the film that's being screened has firm foundations, and to be fair it's a good start, rise of machines is at its heart, as well as difference, evolving change and diverse nations. There are hints of lots of things you've seen before, wars of stars and running blades are all top drawer, but once the façade has been cracked, you'll feel as though you're being hacked, as the pace turns to a saunter, and starts to bore. At the end you'll find the steam has all escaped, that the barrel comes so close to being scraped, an apocalypse of ages, just another war that rages, you're disappointed as you leave, and your coats draped."
"The Creator","benjaminskylerhill","28 September 2023",910,"Gareth Edwards proves himself to be an astoundingly brilliant director with The Creator, as he crafts a visual and auditory world rich with layers of detail, and characters that we quickly understand and naturally grow over the course of the story.He made an $80 million movie that looks like it cost at least twice that. This cost less than half of what Thor: Love and Thunder cost. Let that sink in.Edwards shows he's a better director than writer, as the film is far from original, borrowing concepts and themes from plenty of old classic sci-fi stories. And it's also burdened with some clunky dialogue and rushed, convenient crucial plot points.Yeah, it's imperfect. But it's made with a confidence and care that goes beyond the degree of admirable. It's an earnest expression of love, redemption, sacrifice, and forgiveness put out by a filmmaker who really cares for the characters whose story he's telling.It's a work of art that, even with its flaws, deserves to be seen."
"The Creator","FixedYourEnding","17 November 2023",410,"This is going to be an unpopular review, I know. Maybe I was in the wrong mood coming into this movie, but I turned it off after 25 minutes, couldn't stand it anymore. The whole premise of American white males are constant war-mongers and do not understand progress. If you are an African American you *might* be ok, it helps if you are hurt or imperfect in some other way, if you are a minority then you should be protected and saved, etc etc.The story as a whole makes little sense and it is remains incoherent with empty dialogues and mediocre acting. Why bombs, why the war, it is not explained and when those questions are asked they reply is some sort of a joke, such as ""they are here for our jobs"". Also not explained why would someone remove his prosthetic arm before going to the pool but not his leg. Whatever.The only redeemable quality for this movie is the production value and the almost next-gen gaming-like scenario and photography. I guess if you can ignore everything else, and just look at the imagery you might enjoy it. I personally needed a little more, or actually quite a lot more.This is another polarizing creation. I fell on the ""don't like it"" side, two thumbs down for me. Looks like writers were on strike but CGI was on sale. Exact score: 44 / 100."
"The Creator","masonsaul","28 September 2023",810,"The Creator is an all too rare piece of original epic sci-fi that's built on very familiar foundations and uses them to create something that's as visually exciting as it is emotionally investing, completely unafraid to show American military might for the soulless monster it is.John David Washington plays his reluctant father figure in terrific fashion, closed off at first but those barriers are all successfully worn down by the end. In her screen debut Madeleine Yuna Voyles is amazing, adorable and undoubtedly the main reason any of this works on an emotional level.Supporting them is Ken Watanabe being as effortlessly stoic as always and Allison Janney as an antagonist with a solid amount of depth all thanks to just one scene which efficiently explains her viewpoint in a believable fashion but she's also just plain ruthless in her relentless pursuit.Gareth Edwards once again proves he doesn't need established franchises to create epic imagery or fascinating worlds on a blockbuster scale. Between the stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser & Oren Soffer and the ridiculously impressive CG it outdoes the majority of the competition on a fraction of the cost.Uncharacteristically for Gareth Edwards there's a fair few needle drops early on, the choices can be obvious but always effective and the music by Hans Zimmer is solid. It's mostly just fine up until the third act where it really comes to life and avoids feeling wasted."
"The Creator","CANpatbuck3664","20 October 2023",710,"Starting my review of the creator with some comments on the acting, I'm surprised at how meteoric John David Washington's rise to the top has been. He's a good actor for sure but he's not just ascending the staircase, he's jumping a few steps at a time. He's anchoring the Creator as our protagonist Joshua. I think he's good in the movie, he's brooding for what feels like most of the run time but when he's given a chance to either be funny in short bursts or vulnerable near the end, he gets the job done. Madeleine Yuna Voyles is fine as Alphie, she accomplishes what's required in any given scene and by the end of the movie, she does what she can in regards to selling the bond her character has with Joshua. It's hard to deliver a noteworthy performance as a child actor/actress and she's better than passable. I keep waiting for the Gemma Chan's breakout role but this is one of her better performances as Maya. She has chemistry with Washington but she's given little to do on her own. She's appropriately cast and she sticks the landing in her part. My two favourite performances were from the veteran members of the supporting cast in Ken Watanabe and Allison Janney as Harun and Colonel Howell respectively. Janney pushes the envelope just far enough without descending into being a cartoon character, her character's palpable hatred for the Simulants creates tension and the amount of disdain she conveys through just a look is impressive. Watanabe brings strength to Harun when he needs to but there's also a lot of warmth when his character is bonding with Alphie.Despite some solid work from the cast overall, I'd bet what's probably going to draw your attention in the marketing material for The Creator is the design of this dystopian world and how the war between humans and A. I. dazzles on the big screen. Gareth Edwards and his team weren't working with pennies but this is as impressive of a display for a science fiction movie that I've seen in quite a while. The cinematography is fantastic, the character design of the robots evoked Neil Blomkamp's work for me in the best way without ripping it off and the action set pieces are memorable enough to hold your interest. The movie is just as fantastical (or grounded depending on your opinion on the future of artificial intelligence) as any other sci-fi epic, but there's a beautiful mix of real imagination that keeps the movie grounded just enough that you can still take it seriously. I found it disarming that it was so excellently realized and even if you aren't enthralled by the story, The Creator is still a delight from a visual perspective.I would describe The Creator as story driven as opposed to character driven but we spend enough time with Joshua, Alphie and their friends and enemies to get to know them. I liked the work done on the characters but I wasn't emotionally invested in whether Josh and Maya were going to reunite or if Alphie would make it away safely. I don't want to point the finger at the scriptwriters or the creative team, I was left wondering how much of this movie had been cut out and left on the cutting room floor. Scenes normally required to get us to invest in some of these relationships (e.g. Josh & Alfie, Josh & Shipley or Colonel Howell & McBride) felt like they were missing to me. I don't want to complain about the run time because The Creator isn't a short movie but I was left wondering if they cleaved off a little more than they should have.My most prominent problem with The Creator was how easy to guess the overall arc of the plot was. I didn't discern what it was going to do minute by minute but you can get where the story will start, advance to and finish largely from the trailer. There are some surprises here and there but if you zoom out and observe the macro progression of the plot, this ground has been covered before. Cliche seems a little harsh of a description but The Creator still lacks something bold in where it decides to venture and I was a little disappointed by that.The Creator really falls between a 7-8 for me but this is one of the rare situations where I'm going to round down. The film is still a spectacle and if you can get over that the plot is a little recycled in certain respects, there's a lot here to enjoy. Gareth Edwards and his team deserve kudos for making The Creator a worthy theatre experience. But I still wasn't blown-away by this movie and I wanted it to really kick into the next gear to get past the 8/10 mark. The Creator is a solid science fiction adventure that is worth checking out on the biggest screen you can but outside of it's CGI and visual sensibilities, I don't think it will have the staying power to make the huge impact it's clearly swinging for."
"The Creator","Imshortok06","30 September 2023",510,"You know a movie is bad when you take your Asian immigrant dad to go watch it with you and the first thing he says after watching it is ""Okay, which communist wrote this?!"" The movie's message seemed to be America: bad; military: bad; Asia: good. And there didn't seem to be any compelling reason to root for the robots other than the fact that the kid was cute and the other AI were poor villagers. It seems to me that in order for a movie to be good, the message should be complex and universally compelling. I didn't get what the message was, other than what I previously stated. Literally every bad guy was white and American. It's either very biased or very patronizing. On the other hand, I did think the actors did a good job, and the cinematography was outstanding."
"The Creator","DanTheMan2150AD","28 September 2023",710,"7 years on from his last big screen venture with the phenomenal Rogue One, The Creator isn't quite the comeback I had hoped for director Gareth Edwards. Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid ""simulants"", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic."
"The Creator","TheVictoriousV","1 October 2023",510,"When the trailer for The Creator came out, I basically became a Facebook Disney fangirl but, like, the opposite.I was all ""OMGOMG it's a big Hollywood sci-fi movie but, like, it's made by a director with a voice and... Get this... it's based on ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No really, they FINALLY remade/rebooted/did a sequel to NOT A DAMN THING!! OMGOMG, I've waited my whole life for originality! TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!""Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be ""huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot. Some of these images are worthy of the pages of Simon Stålenhag.Here's hoping Edwards someday adapts some of his tales."
"The Creator","poseyfan","29 September 2023",710,"This is a lesson to the movie industry on how to use a budget. 80 million dollars was used splendidly. The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects. AND filmmakers everywhere should learn how a budget should be used."
"The Creator","prberg2","30 September 2023",510,"Oh, I really wanted to like this movie. Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important ""weapon/creation""? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way."
"The Creator","BA_Harrison","27 September 2023",510,"The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb."
"The Creator","weraqs","25 November 2023",710,"Walking into the theater, my expectations were a mix of excitement and curiosity, especially given the film's intriguing take on AI.From the get-go, ""The Creator"" impressed me with its use of the $80 million budget. The cinematography was nothing short of remarkable, reminding me of the visual flair seen in ""Blade Runner"" ""Elysium"", ""I, Robot"" and ""A. I."" The world-building was immersive, creating a believable and lived-in environment that drew me in.The performances, particularly the dynamic between Joshua and Alfie, were the highlights of the film for me. Their interactions brought depth to the story, and I found myself genuinely invested in their journey. However, as the plot progressed, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment.The story, which began with promise, started to unravel. The pacing felt rushed, and the plot became increasingly predictable. I noticed glaring plot holes that were hard to overlook, and the narrative lacked the depth I had hoped for. The ambitious theme of AI's humanity, which initially seemed thought-provoking, was undermined by the film's inability to maintain coherence.While I appreciated the technical brilliance of the film, including the special effects and sound design, the script was a letdown. It was as if the movie wanted to say something profound about AI and humanity but ended up glossing over these complex themes, opting instead for a more superficial treatment.The characters, aside from Joshua, felt one-dimensional. I struggled to connect with them emotionally, this emotional disconnect was particularly evident in the portrayal of the AI characters, including Alfie, who, despite being central to the story, lacked the depth to make their plight resonate with me.While ""The Creator"" started off with great potential, it ultimately left me feeling underwhelmed. The film excelled in its visual storytelling but fell short in its narrative execution. It was a visually captivating experience, but the lack of emotional depth and narrative coherence made it a disappointing outing for me. I walked out of the theater feeling that the movie, despite its grand aspirations, missed the mark in delivering a fully engaging and thought-provoking sci-fi experience. It could have been a masterpiece, but a missed opportunity at best."
"The Creator","FeastMode","28 September 2023",410,"Sigh. As a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was looking forward to this new original stand-alone sci-fi movie. And I left fully disappointed. It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie. It could not get me engaged or invested, which is not a difficult task for someone who loves movie as much as I do.(1 viewing, early access screening UltraScreen 9/27/2023)"
"The Creator","kgprophet","29 September 2023",510,"Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick ""The Gray Man"". ""Creator"" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in ""The Manchurian"". Or the chosen kid in ""The Last Airbender"". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in ""Willow"". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In ""Creator"", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of ""Chappie"" with a robot police force. It could also resemble ""Elysium"", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, ""Apocalypse Now""-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish ""assassin turned compassionate"" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go ""Huh?"" ""What?"". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping on the ""A. I."" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words ""Artificial Intelligence"" and ""A. I."" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making ""Rogue One: A Star Wars story"". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10."
"The Creator","Jim_Screechy","17 November 2023",510,"I watched this from start to finish without being drawn into the story at any point.I think John Washington is miscast here, I had the same exact experience when i watched Tenet... found myself very disconnected as I he didn't seem to make a proper connection with the role he was portraying.That is not to say the film isn't without issues. They have been fairly well documented by other reviewers so I'll not labour the points here.My main issue is with the lack of emotional involvment with the characters. The film measures zero on the emtional richter scale, but more, the screenplay just doesn't manage to get you excited or involved with anything that is unfolding. Additionally, the characters seem to have little connection to each other. In fact it is only at the end of the movie that Joshua and Alphie seem to have any tangible emotional cohesion.Contrast this with The Golden Child 1986 where Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell and the connection he makes to The Golden Child played by J. L. Reate. Here you can see what a great connection is established on screen and the massive difference in outcome it produces. Both films have two similar sets of pairings in almost identical scenarios with a stark contrast in outcome.Anyway, for me the film was a big dissapointment, I can't say John David Washington was the cause of this since the Movie has many other problematic aspects, but the ones I've mentioned were particularly significant for me.5/10 sadly."
"The Creator","davemanson","11 October 2023",410,"With stunning visuals reminiscent of Blade Runner and the more recent Rouge One this movie is stunning to look at. Unfortunately the script falls far short of living up to its inspired cinematography. It's full of plot holes and cringe worthy moments from it's extremely one dimensional villains. The plot twist are telegraphed from miles away and there are no real surprises to be had. Everything plays out exactly like you would expect it to. Which is a shame. The look and mood of this film is almost enough to save it. But in the end it falls flat and its potential is wasted. See it for the visuals. Forget it for its script."
"The Creator","kevin_robbins","30 September 2023",610,"My wife and I caught The Creator (2023) in theaters last night. The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once."
"The Creator","Lomax343","28 September 2023",610,"Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity."
"The Creator","alex_with_a_P","1 October 2023",410,"AI is such a rich topic, it can be explored from any kind of angles but this movie decided to use it only as a prop. The AI people are just stand-ins for oppressed people X. None of the AI people are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!), which is one of many advantages machines would have over humans. The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and in a better way.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Awkward change of tones, a weird plot structure with constant flashbacks, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas at play. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the 135min runtime, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to another.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country where the story takes place doesn't have military or a defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers will only be used for a door. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. The last action set piece in particular is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices. Next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. Mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, those have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their task of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing interesting. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. And I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only aesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame."
"The Creator","ethanbresnett","29 September 2023",710,"The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill.It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless.The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film.There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid.Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though."

Absolutely stunning work from director Gareth Edwards and cinematographer Oren Soffer. Shot on a Sony FX3 and on location. Impressive. From color grades, shots and VFX...all top notch. A visual spectacle.Although Gareth Edwards pulls through visually, he fails miserably on the storyline. The amount of times my party sat there and looked at each other saying ""wait, what? Why?"" was too much to count. Things didnt add up and begs the audience to question many things. As if Edwards was just trying to get to an ending rather than build the story. Creating that tension or closeness between ai and humans was lacking.John Washington's mono tone, emotionless acting contributed to that disconnect. The exact ""read off the script"" acting we saw in Tenet. How he got this role is mind blowing and nepotism at its finest. His performance was only saved by child actor Madeleine Voyles, who was great. Few other questionable casting decisions, you'll see if you choose to not wait for the stream (the soccer mom playing a ruthless captain)All in all, this film was entertaining at the very least. Could have been awesome as i love how rogue one was done and im not a star wars fanatic.Worth the ticket? Eh yea not bad but definitely not a rewatch. Oh and ill never watch anything with John Washington again lol."
"The Creator","RussHog","1 January 2024",810,"My friend told me if I saw this in theaters some of the gaping plot holes would stand out more - but as it is I saw it at home and frankly I could care less if there were some plot holes this is a very good film with incredible world building.It tells the story of human v AI and our hero is a former soldier who is sent to track down the AI's ultimate weapon. Turns out the weapon is a child AI - who may or may not have the secret to his seemingly dead wife's location - and now our hero betrays his people to keep the AI safe and try to find his wife.His journey with the AI takes him deep into the heart of this world, and he eventually grows to care for the AI and rebels against his own people. It may sound cliche, but these kinds of stories need to be told again and again.By no stretch of the imagination is this corny like Avatar, this was a very good by the numbers sci-fi movie. Well acted, great special effects, good action scenes, and a big heart with a cool final showdown.Def recommended, too bad I didn't watch this in theaters."
"The Creator","Darksidecrew","28 September 2023",NA,"This new sci-fi film from Gareth Edwards (Rogue One) was made for $80 million but looks like $350 million on screen. It's a global epic on a massive scale. This is how I like films to look, I think it was probably shot on digital but they've made it look like it was shot on film. It does have shades of Terminator, Blade Runner and even Terrence Malick but it also brings some new dimensions to some classic themes. Not only the craftsmanship but the acting is also top notch in this fully immersive tale. It moves very quickly which will help you get past sone story logistics that might crumble on closer examination. A superb effort that leaves the glossy soulless and often brainless blockbusters of recent decades in the dust. A quality film that I recommend supporting in the theaters."

"The Creator","nscoby93","29 September 2023",310,"That is literally all that comes to mind a disappointment. Going in, I genuinely wanted to like this movie. I mean the director of Rogue One doing a standalone new title sci-fi film. What could go wrong? Well, apparently, everything.Let me get through the positives because that's a short list. Good acting, a great concept, and an interesting world... um, that's it.So what's bad about this film? Well, literally everything else. The story is a mess and told equally as messy. The film is convulted and tries so hard to appear deep, intelligent, and emotional, yet it's all surface and is very plain to see how empty it truly is. Unfortunately, Hans Zimmers score does nothing here as the music just didn't stand out, so I was surprised to see that he composed the music.But I think what bothered me the most about this film is that it felt like a more annoying version of Avatar. Gareth Edward's, in my opinion, like James Cameron, shows absolutely no discretion on whom the audience should side with. It all comes off as manipulation and extremely biased. So humans bad, aliens good, turns into America/Western Culture bad, and New Asia/Eastern Culture good.There is no character on the side of the Americans aside from John David Washington's character who is ""good"" or likeable but on the side of the robots they are all victims and the people of New Asia are victims of the oppressive and evil Americans. Who are basically painted as this worlds version of the Empire. They even have a deadly space station. While the robots are the Rebel Alliance doing what they can to fight this evil.So obviously as a viewer and decent human being I won't side with the Americans but the film does nothing to prove to me these robots are the victims that Gareth Edward's so desperately wants me to believe. In fact, there's a sequence that proves to me the opposite that some of these robots will kill their own people to protect this child who is essentially a Christ like figure to the robots. There is absolutely no unbiased look at both sides in this Vietnam like conflict.Then, at the end of everything, the explanation as to the reason for this war is absolutely moronic, I'd say what it is, but that's touching on spoiler territory.The movie explains nothing in the way of what this AI is or how it became ""sentient,"" etc. Also, if these robots are so peaceful and innocent, then why not make an attempt at peace? But that wouldn't happen because America is evil and dead set on destroying all AI consciousness, so any peacetalks would undoubtedly fail. Edward's here expects the audience to take everything at face value and not question anything. Which is exactly what the liberal mind expects from you, so I shouldn't be surprised. Now, I wouldn't say Gareth Edward's is a liberal as I don't know the man, but he's playing with liberal ideologies.Then, the movie tries to be a social commentary on war, which fails miserable because it conflicts with the notion of the robots being all innocent victims. Essentially, the message being all war is unjust, and the ones who suffer the most are the innocent who get caught in the crossfire.So if this film truly wanted to show that war is the real enemy, then don't paint one side as innocent victims and paint the other as cruel, oppressive aggressors. Instead, put in some effort and show that both sides aren't innocent that both sides have done evil to one another.Finally the film is no where near as beautiful as trailers made it out to look, but I'm going to be honest here and say that's most likely due to the fact we watched this film in a crap auditorium. So, hopefully, upon a second viewing, which I do plan on having, it'll be with a better projector and screen. But also so much of this movie took place at night, which I could not understand why. Perhaps so they didn't have to show so much? I have no clue. The action, I guess, looked good, but I just didn't care for what was happening in it.Anyway, I will close things here and say I'm sure a great many people would disagree with me, but that's fine. These are the issues I had with this film, and they are simply my opinions. If you liked this movie, then great. I'm happy for you, but I am just genuinely disappointed. Though, after seeing the film, I can understand why it has mixed scores.IMDb: 3/10
Letterboxd: 2/5Watched in Theaters."
"The Creator","Xstal","2 October 2023",510,"As the opening kicks off there's expectations, that the film that's being screened has firm foundations, and to be fair it's a good start, rise of machines is at its heart, as well as difference, evolving change and diverse nations. There are hints of lots of things you've seen before, wars of stars and running blades are all top drawer, but once the façade has been cracked, you'll feel as though you're being hacked, as the pace turns to a saunter, and starts to bore. At the end you'll find the steam has all escaped, that the barrel comes so close to being scraped, an apocalypse of ages, just another war that rages, you're disappointed as you leave, and your coats draped."
"The Creator","benjaminskylerhill","28 September 2023",910,"Gareth Edwards proves himself to be an astoundingly brilliant director with The Creator, as he crafts a visual and auditory world rich with layers of detail, and characters that we quickly understand and naturally grow over the course of the story.He made an $80 million movie that looks like it cost at least twice that. This cost less than half of what Thor: Love and Thunder cost. Let that sink in.Edwards shows he's a better director than writer, as the film is far from original, borrowing concepts and themes from plenty of old classic sci-fi stories. And it's also burdened with some clunky dialogue and rushed, convenient crucial plot points.Yeah, it's imperfect. But it's made with a confidence and care that goes beyond the degree of admirable. It's an earnest expression of love, redemption, sacrifice, and forgiveness put out by a filmmaker who really cares for the characters whose story he's telling.It's a work of art that, even with its flaws, deserves to be seen."
"The Creator","FixedYourEnding","17 November 2023",410,"This is going to be an unpopular review, I know. Maybe I was in the wrong mood coming into this movie, but I turned it off after 25 minutes, couldn't stand it anymore. The whole premise of American white males are constant war-mongers and do not understand progress. If you are an African American you *might* be ok, it helps if you are hurt or imperfect in some other way, if you are a minority then you should be protected and saved, etc etc.The story as a whole makes little sense and it is remains incoherent with empty dialogues and mediocre acting. Why bombs, why the war, it is not explained and when those questions are asked they reply is some sort of a joke, such as ""they are here for our jobs"". Also not explained why would someone remove his prosthetic arm before going to the pool but not his leg. Whatever.The only redeemable quality for this movie is the production value and the almost next-gen gaming-like scenario and photography. I guess if you can ignore everything else, and just look at the imagery you might enjoy it. I personally needed a little more, or actually quite a lot more.This is another polarizing creation. I fell on the ""don't like it"" side, two thumbs down for me. Looks like writers were on strike but CGI was on sale. Exact score: 44 / 100."
"The Creator","masonsaul","28 September 2023",810,"The Creator is an all too rare piece of original epic sci-fi that's built on very familiar foundations and uses them to create something that's as visually exciting as it is emotionally investing, completely unafraid to show American military might for the soulless monster it is.John David Washington plays his reluctant father figure in terrific fashion, closed off at first but those barriers are all successfully worn down by the end. In her screen debut Madeleine Yuna Voyles is amazing, adorable and undoubtedly the main reason any of this works on an emotional level.Supporting them is Ken Watanabe being as effortlessly stoic as always and Allison Janney as an antagonist with a solid amount of depth all thanks to just one scene which efficiently explains her viewpoint in a believable fashion but she's also just plain ruthless in her relentless pursuit.Gareth Edwards once again proves he doesn't need established franchises to create epic imagery or fascinating worlds on a blockbuster scale. Between the stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser & Oren Soffer and the ridiculously impressive CG it outdoes the majority of the competition on a fraction of the cost.Uncharacteristically for Gareth Edwards there's a fair few needle drops early on, the choices can be obvious but always effective and the music by Hans Zimmer is solid. It's mostly just fine up until the third act where it really comes to life and avoids feeling wasted."
"The Creator","CANpatbuck3664","20 October 2023",710,"Starting my review of the creator with some comments on the acting, I'm surprised at how meteoric John David Washington's rise to the top has been. He's a good actor for sure but he's not just ascending the staircase, he's jumping a few steps at a time. He's anchoring the Creator as our protagonist Joshua. I think he's good in the movie, he's brooding for what feels like most of the run time but when he's given a chance to either be funny in short bursts or vulnerable near the end, he gets the job done. Madeleine Yuna Voyles is fine as Alphie, she accomplishes what's required in any given scene and by the end of the movie, she does what she can in regards to selling the bond her character has with Joshua. It's hard to deliver a noteworthy performance as a child actor/actress and she's better than passable. I keep waiting for the Gemma Chan's breakout role but this is one of her better performances as Maya. She has chemistry with Washington but she's given little to do on her own. She's appropriately cast and she sticks the landing in her part. My two favourite performances were from the veteran members of the supporting cast in Ken Watanabe and Allison Janney as Harun and Colonel Howell respectively. Janney pushes the envelope just far enough without descending into being a cartoon character, her character's palpable hatred for the Simulants creates tension and the amount of disdain she conveys through just a look is impressive. Watanabe brings strength to Harun when he needs to but there's also a lot of warmth when his character is bonding with Alphie.Despite some solid work from the cast overall, I'd bet what's probably going to draw your attention in the marketing material for The Creator is the design of this dystopian world and how the war between humans and A. I. dazzles on the big screen. Gareth Edwards and his team weren't working with pennies but this is as impressive of a display for a science fiction movie that I've seen in quite a while. The cinematography is fantastic, the character design of the robots evoked Neil Blomkamp's work for me in the best way without ripping it off and the action set pieces are memorable enough to hold your interest. The movie is just as fantastical (or grounded depending on your opinion on the future of artificial intelligence) as any other sci-fi epic, but there's a beautiful mix of real imagination that keeps the movie grounded just enough that you can still take it seriously. I found it disarming that it was so excellently realized and even if you aren't enthralled by the story, The Creator is still a delight from a visual perspective.I would describe The Creator as story driven as opposed to character driven but we spend enough time with Joshua, Alphie and their friends and enemies to get to know them. I liked the work done on the characters but I wasn't emotionally invested in whether Josh and Maya were going to reunite or if Alphie would make it away safely. I don't want to point the finger at the scriptwriters or the creative team, I was left wondering how much of this movie had been cut out and left on the cutting room floor. Scenes normally required to get us to invest in some of these relationships (e.g. Josh & Alfie, Josh & Shipley or Colonel Howell & McBride) felt like they were missing to me. I don't want to complain about the run time because The Creator isn't a short movie but I was left wondering if they cleaved off a little more than they should have.My most prominent problem with The Creator was how easy to guess the overall arc of the plot was. I didn't discern what it was going to do minute by minute but you can get where the story will start, advance to and finish largely from the trailer. There are some surprises here and there but if you zoom out and observe the macro progression of the plot, this ground has been covered before. Cliche seems a little harsh of a description but The Creator still lacks something bold in where it decides to venture and I was a little disappointed by that.The Creator really falls between a 7-8 for me but this is one of the rare situations where I'm going to round down. The film is still a spectacle and if you can get over that the plot is a little recycled in certain respects, there's a lot here to enjoy. Gareth Edwards and his team deserve kudos for making The Creator a worthy theatre experience. But I still wasn't blown-away by this movie and I wanted it to really kick into the next gear to get past the 8/10 mark. The Creator is a solid science fiction adventure that is worth checking out on the biggest screen you can but outside of it's CGI and visual sensibilities, I don't think it will have the staying power to make the huge impact it's clearly swinging for."
"The Creator","Imshortok06","30 September 2023",510,"You know a movie is bad when you take your Asian immigrant dad to go watch it with you and the first thing he says after watching it is ""Okay, which communist wrote this?!"" The movie's message seemed to be America: bad; military: bad; Asia: good. And there didn't seem to be any compelling reason to root for the robots other than the fact that the kid was cute and the other AI were poor villagers. It seems to me that in order for a movie to be good, the message should be complex and universally compelling. I didn't get what the message was, other than what I previously stated. Literally every bad guy was white and American. It's either very biased or very patronizing. On the other hand, I did think the actors did a good job, and the cinematography was outstanding."
"The Creator","DanTheMan2150AD","28 September 2023",710,"7 years on from his last big screen venture with the phenomenal Rogue One, The Creator isn't quite the comeback I had hoped for director Gareth Edwards. Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid ""simulants"", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic."
"The Creator","TheVictoriousV","1 October 2023",510,"When the trailer for The Creator came out, I basically became a Facebook Disney fangirl but, like, the opposite.I was all ""OMGOMG it's a big Hollywood sci-fi movie but, like, it's made by a director with a voice and... Get this... it's based on ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No really, they FINALLY remade/rebooted/did a sequel to NOT A DAMN THING!! OMGOMG, I've waited my whole life for originality! TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!""Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be ""huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot. Some of these images are worthy of the pages of Simon Stålenhag.Here's hoping Edwards someday adapts some of his tales."
"The Creator","poseyfan","29 September 2023",710,"This is a lesson to the movie industry on how to use a budget. 80 million dollars was used splendidly. The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects. AND filmmakers everywhere should learn how a budget should be used."
"The Creator","prberg2","30 September 2023",510,"Oh, I really wanted to like this movie. Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important ""weapon/creation""? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way."
"The Creator","BA_Harrison","27 September 2023",510,"The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb."
"The Creator","weraqs","25 November 2023",710,"Walking into the theater, my expectations were a mix of excitement and curiosity, especially given the film's intriguing take on AI.From the get-go, ""The Creator"" impressed me with its use of the $80 million budget. The cinematography was nothing short of remarkable, reminding me of the visual flair seen in ""Blade Runner"" ""Elysium"", ""I, Robot"" and ""A. I."" The world-building was immersive, creating a believable and lived-in environment that drew me in.The performances, particularly the dynamic between Joshua and Alfie, were the highlights of the film for me. Their interactions brought depth to the story, and I found myself genuinely invested in their journey. However, as the plot progressed, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment.The story, which began with promise, started to unravel. The pacing felt rushed, and the plot became increasingly predictable. I noticed glaring plot holes that were hard to overlook, and the narrative lacked the depth I had hoped for. The ambitious theme of AI's humanity, which initially seemed thought-provoking, was undermined by the film's inability to maintain coherence.While I appreciated the technical brilliance of the film, including the special effects and sound design, the script was a letdown. It was as if the movie wanted to say something profound about AI and humanity but ended up glossing over these complex themes, opting instead for a more superficial treatment.The characters, aside from Joshua, felt one-dimensional. I struggled to connect with them emotionally, this emotional disconnect was particularly evident in the portrayal of the AI characters, including Alfie, who, despite being central to the story, lacked the depth to make their plight resonate with me.While ""The Creator"" started off with great potential, it ultimately left me feeling underwhelmed. The film excelled in its visual storytelling but fell short in its narrative execution. It was a visually captivating experience, but the lack of emotional depth and narrative coherence made it a disappointing outing for me. I walked out of the theater feeling that the movie, despite its grand aspirations, missed the mark in delivering a fully engaging and thought-provoking sci-fi experience. It could have been a masterpiece, but a missed opportunity at best."
"The Creator","FeastMode","28 September 2023",410,"Sigh. As a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was looking forward to this new original stand-alone sci-fi movie. And I left fully disappointed. It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie. It could not get me engaged or invested, which is not a difficult task for someone who loves movie as much as I do.(1 viewing, early access screening UltraScreen 9/27/2023)"
"The Creator","kgprophet","29 September 2023",510,"Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick ""The Gray Man"". ""Creator"" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in ""The Manchurian"". Or the chosen kid in ""The Last Airbender"". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in ""Willow"". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In ""Creator"", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of ""Chappie"" with a robot police force. It could also resemble ""Elysium"", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, ""Apocalypse Now""-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish ""assassin turned compassionate"" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go ""Huh?"" ""What?"". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping on the ""A. I."" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words ""Artificial Intelligence"" and ""A. I."" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making ""Rogue One: A Star Wars story"". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10."
"The Creator","Jim_Screechy","17 November 2023",510,"I watched this from start to finish without being drawn into the story at any point.I think John Washington is miscast here, I had the same exact experience when i watched Tenet... found myself very disconnected as I he didn't seem to make a proper connection with the role he was portraying.That is not to say the film isn't without issues. They have been fairly well documented by other reviewers so I'll not labour the points here.My main issue is with the lack of emotional involvment with the characters. The film measures zero on the emtional richter scale, but more, the screenplay just doesn't manage to get you excited or involved with anything that is unfolding. Additionally, the characters seem to have little connection to each other. In fact it is only at the end of the movie that Joshua and Alphie seem to have any tangible emotional cohesion.Contrast this with The Golden Child 1986 where Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell and the connection he makes to The Golden Child played by J. L. Reate. Here you can see what a great connection is established on screen and the massive difference in outcome it produces. Both films have two similar sets of pairings in almost identical scenarios with a stark contrast in outcome.Anyway, for me the film was a big dissapointment, I can't say John David Washington was the cause of this since the Movie has many other problematic aspects, but the ones I've mentioned were particularly significant for me.5/10 sadly."
"The Creator","davemanson","11 October 2023",410,"With stunning visuals reminiscent of Blade Runner and the more recent Rouge One this movie is stunning to look at. Unfortunately the script falls far short of living up to its inspired cinematography. It's full of plot holes and cringe worthy moments from it's extremely one dimensional villains. The plot twist are telegraphed from miles away and there are no real surprises to be had. Everything plays out exactly like you would expect it to. Which is a shame. The look and mood of this film is almost enough to save it. But in the end it falls flat and its potential is wasted. See it for the visuals. Forget it for its script."
"The Creator","kevin_robbins","30 September 2023",610,"My wife and I caught The Creator (2023) in theaters last night. The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once."
"The Creator","Lomax343","28 September 2023",610,"Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity."
"The Creator","alex_with_a_P","1 October 2023",410,"AI is such a rich topic, it can be explored from any kind of angles but this movie decided to use it only as a prop. The AI people are just stand-ins for oppressed people X. None of the AI people are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!), which is one of many advantages machines would have over humans. The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and in a better way.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Awkward change of tones, a weird plot structure with constant flashbacks, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas at play. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the 135min runtime, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to another.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country where the story takes place doesn't have military or a defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers will only be used for a door. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. The last action set piece in particular is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices. Next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. Mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, those have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their task of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing interesting. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. And I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only aesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame."
"The Creator","ethanbresnett","29 September 2023",710,"The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill.It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless.The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film.There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid.Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though."

Absolutely stunning work from director Gareth Edwards and cinematographer Oren Soffer. Shot on a Sony FX3 and on location. Impressive. From color grades, shots and VFX...all top notch. A visual spectacle.Although Gareth Edwards pulls through visually, he fails miserably on the storyline. The amount of times my party sat there and looked at each other saying ""wait, what? Why?"" was too much to count. Things didnt add up and begs the audience to question many things. As if Edwards was just trying to get to an ending rather than build the story. Creating that tension or closeness between ai and humans was lacking.John Washington's mono tone, emotionless acting contributed to that disconnect. The exact ""read off the script"" acting we saw in Tenet. How he got this role is mind blowing and nepotism at its finest. His performance was only saved by child actor Madeleine Voyles, who was great. Few other questionable casting decisions, you'll see if you choose to not wait for the stream (the soccer mom playing a ruthless captain)All in all, this film was entertaining at the very least. Could have been awesome as i love how rogue one was done and im not a star wars fanatic.Worth the ticket? Eh yea not bad but definitely not a rewatch. Oh and ill never watch anything with John Washington again lol."
"The Creator","RussHog","1 January 2024",810,"My friend told me if I saw this in theaters some of the gaping plot holes would stand out more - but as it is I saw it at home and frankly I could care less if there were some plot holes this is a very good film with incredible world building.It tells the story of human v AI and our hero is a former soldier who is sent to track down the AI's ultimate weapon. Turns out the weapon is a child AI - who may or may not have the secret to his seemingly dead wife's location - and now our hero betrays his people to keep the AI safe and try to find his wife.His journey with the AI takes him deep into the heart of this world, and he eventually grows to care for the AI and rebels against his own people. It may sound cliche, but these kinds of stories need to be told again and again.By no stretch of the imagination is this corny like Avatar, this was a very good by the numbers sci-fi movie. Well acted, great special effects, good action scenes, and a big heart with a cool final showdown.Def recommended, too bad I didn't watch this in theaters."
"The Creator","Darksidecrew","28 September 2023",NA,"This new sci-fi film from Gareth Edwards (Rogue One) was made for $80 million but looks like $350 million on screen. It's a global epic on a massive scale. This is how I like films to look, I think it was probably shot on digital but they've made it look like it was shot on film. It does have shades of Terminator, Blade Runner and even Terrence Malick but it also brings some new dimensions to some classic themes. Not only the craftsmanship but the acting is also top notch in this fully immersive tale. It moves very quickly which will help you get past sone story logistics that might crumble on closer examination. A superb effort that leaves the glossy soulless and often brainless blockbusters of recent decades in the dust. A quality film that I recommend supporting in the theaters."

"The Creator","nscoby93","29 September 2023",310,"That is literally all that comes to mind a disappointment. Going in, I genuinely wanted to like this movie. I mean the director of Rogue One doing a standalone new title sci-fi film. What could go wrong? Well, apparently, everything.Let me get through the positives because that's a short list. Good acting, a great concept, and an interesting world... um, that's it.So what's bad about this film? Well, literally everything else. The story is a mess and told equally as messy. The film is convulted and tries so hard to appear deep, intelligent, and emotional, yet it's all surface and is very plain to see how empty it truly is. Unfortunately, Hans Zimmers score does nothing here as the music just didn't stand out, so I was surprised to see that he composed the music.But I think what bothered me the most about this film is that it felt like a more annoying version of Avatar. Gareth Edward's, in my opinion, like James Cameron, shows absolutely no discretion on whom the audience should side with. It all comes off as manipulation and extremely biased. So humans bad, aliens good, turns into America/Western Culture bad, and New Asia/Eastern Culture good.There is no character on the side of the Americans aside from John David Washington's character who is ""good"" or likeable but on the side of the robots they are all victims and the people of New Asia are victims of the oppressive and evil Americans. Who are basically painted as this worlds version of the Empire. They even have a deadly space station. While the robots are the Rebel Alliance doing what they can to fight this evil.So obviously as a viewer and decent human being I won't side with the Americans but the film does nothing to prove to me these robots are the victims that Gareth Edward's so desperately wants me to believe. In fact, there's a sequence that proves to me the opposite that some of these robots will kill their own people to protect this child who is essentially a Christ like figure to the robots. There is absolutely no unbiased look at both sides in this Vietnam like conflict.Then, at the end of everything, the explanation as to the reason for this war is absolutely moronic, I'd say what it is, but that's touching on spoiler territory.The movie explains nothing in the way of what this AI is or how it became ""sentient,"" etc. Also, if these robots are so peaceful and innocent, then why not make an attempt at peace? But that wouldn't happen because America is evil and dead set on destroying all AI consciousness, so any peacetalks would undoubtedly fail. Edward's here expects the audience to take everything at face value and not question anything. Which is exactly what the liberal mind expects from you, so I shouldn't be surprised. Now, I wouldn't say Gareth Edward's is a liberal as I don't know the man, but he's playing with liberal ideologies.Then, the movie tries to be a social commentary on war, which fails miserable because it conflicts with the notion of the robots being all innocent victims. Essentially, the message being all war is unjust, and the ones who suffer the most are the innocent who get caught in the crossfire.So if this film truly wanted to show that war is the real enemy, then don't paint one side as innocent victims and paint the other as cruel, oppressive aggressors. Instead, put in some effort and show that both sides aren't innocent that both sides have done evil to one another.Finally the film is no where near as beautiful as trailers made it out to look, but I'm going to be honest here and say that's most likely due to the fact we watched this film in a crap auditorium. So, hopefully, upon a second viewing, which I do plan on having, it'll be with a better projector and screen. But also so much of this movie took place at night, which I could not understand why. Perhaps so they didn't have to show so much? I have no clue. The action, I guess, looked good, but I just didn't care for what was happening in it.Anyway, I will close things here and say I'm sure a great many people would disagree with me, but that's fine. These are the issues I had with this film, and they are simply my opinions. If you liked this movie, then great. I'm happy for you, but I am just genuinely disappointed. Though, after seeing the film, I can understand why it has mixed scores.IMDb: 3/10
Letterboxd: 2/5Watched in Theaters."
"The Creator","Xstal","2 October 2023",510,"As the opening kicks off there's expectations, that the film that's being screened has firm foundations, and to be fair it's a good start, rise of machines is at its heart, as well as difference, evolving change and diverse nations. There are hints of lots of things you've seen before, wars of stars and running blades are all top drawer, but once the façade has been cracked, you'll feel as though you're being hacked, as the pace turns to a saunter, and starts to bore. At the end you'll find the steam has all escaped, that the barrel comes so close to being scraped, an apocalypse of ages, just another war that rages, you're disappointed as you leave, and your coats draped."
"The Creator","benjaminskylerhill","28 September 2023",910,"Gareth Edwards proves himself to be an astoundingly brilliant director with The Creator, as he crafts a visual and auditory world rich with layers of detail, and characters that we quickly understand and naturally grow over the course of the story.He made an $80 million movie that looks like it cost at least twice that. This cost less than half of what Thor: Love and Thunder cost. Let that sink in.Edwards shows he's a better director than writer, as the film is far from original, borrowing concepts and themes from plenty of old classic sci-fi stories. And it's also burdened with some clunky dialogue and rushed, convenient crucial plot points.Yeah, it's imperfect. But it's made with a confidence and care that goes beyond the degree of admirable. It's an earnest expression of love, redemption, sacrifice, and forgiveness put out by a filmmaker who really cares for the characters whose story he's telling.It's a work of art that, even with its flaws, deserves to be seen."
"The Creator","FixedYourEnding","17 November 2023",410,"This is going to be an unpopular review, I know. Maybe I was in the wrong mood coming into this movie, but I turned it off after 25 minutes, couldn't stand it anymore. The whole premise of American white males are constant war-mongers and do not understand progress. If you are an African American you *might* be ok, it helps if you are hurt or imperfect in some other way, if you are a minority then you should be protected and saved, etc etc.The story as a whole makes little sense and it is remains incoherent with empty dialogues and mediocre acting. Why bombs, why the war, it is not explained and when those questions are asked they reply is some sort of a joke, such as ""they are here for our jobs"". Also not explained why would someone remove his prosthetic arm before going to the pool but not his leg. Whatever.The only redeemable quality for this movie is the production value and the almost next-gen gaming-like scenario and photography. I guess if you can ignore everything else, and just look at the imagery you might enjoy it. I personally needed a little more, or actually quite a lot more.This is another polarizing creation. I fell on the ""don't like it"" side, two thumbs down for me. Looks like writers were on strike but CGI was on sale. Exact score: 44 / 100."
"The Creator","masonsaul","28 September 2023",810,"The Creator is an all too rare piece of original epic sci-fi that's built on very familiar foundations and uses them to create something that's as visually exciting as it is emotionally investing, completely unafraid to show American military might for the soulless monster it is.John David Washington plays his reluctant father figure in terrific fashion, closed off at first but those barriers are all successfully worn down by the end. In her screen debut Madeleine Yuna Voyles is amazing, adorable and undoubtedly the main reason any of this works on an emotional level.Supporting them is Ken Watanabe being as effortlessly stoic as always and Allison Janney as an antagonist with a solid amount of depth all thanks to just one scene which efficiently explains her viewpoint in a believable fashion but she's also just plain ruthless in her relentless pursuit.Gareth Edwards once again proves he doesn't need established franchises to create epic imagery or fascinating worlds on a blockbuster scale. Between the stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser & Oren Soffer and the ridiculously impressive CG it outdoes the majority of the competition on a fraction of the cost.Uncharacteristically for Gareth Edwards there's a fair few needle drops early on, the choices can be obvious but always effective and the music by Hans Zimmer is solid. It's mostly just fine up until the third act where it really comes to life and avoids feeling wasted."
"The Creator","CANpatbuck3664","20 October 2023",710,"Starting my review of the creator with some comments on the acting, I'm surprised at how meteoric John David Washington's rise to the top has been. He's a good actor for sure but he's not just ascending the staircase, he's jumping a few steps at a time. He's anchoring the Creator as our protagonist Joshua. I think he's good in the movie, he's brooding for what feels like most of the run time but when he's given a chance to either be funny in short bursts or vulnerable near the end, he gets the job done. Madeleine Yuna Voyles is fine as Alphie, she accomplishes what's required in any given scene and by the end of the movie, she does what she can in regards to selling the bond her character has with Joshua. It's hard to deliver a noteworthy performance as a child actor/actress and she's better than passable. I keep waiting for the Gemma Chan's breakout role but this is one of her better performances as Maya. She has chemistry with Washington but she's given little to do on her own. She's appropriately cast and she sticks the landing in her part. My two favourite performances were from the veteran members of the supporting cast in Ken Watanabe and Allison Janney as Harun and Colonel Howell respectively. Janney pushes the envelope just far enough without descending into being a cartoon character, her character's palpable hatred for the Simulants creates tension and the amount of disdain she conveys through just a look is impressive. Watanabe brings strength to Harun when he needs to but there's also a lot of warmth when his character is bonding with Alphie.Despite some solid work from the cast overall, I'd bet what's probably going to draw your attention in the marketing material for The Creator is the design of this dystopian world and how the war between humans and A. I. dazzles on the big screen. Gareth Edwards and his team weren't working with pennies but this is as impressive of a display for a science fiction movie that I've seen in quite a while. The cinematography is fantastic, the character design of the robots evoked Neil Blomkamp's work for me in the best way without ripping it off and the action set pieces are memorable enough to hold your interest. The movie is just as fantastical (or grounded depending on your opinion on the future of artificial intelligence) as any other sci-fi epic, but there's a beautiful mix of real imagination that keeps the movie grounded just enough that you can still take it seriously. I found it disarming that it was so excellently realized and even if you aren't enthralled by the story, The Creator is still a delight from a visual perspective.I would describe The Creator as story driven as opposed to character driven but we spend enough time with Joshua, Alphie and their friends and enemies to get to know them. I liked the work done on the characters but I wasn't emotionally invested in whether Josh and Maya were going to reunite or if Alphie would make it away safely. I don't want to point the finger at the scriptwriters or the creative team, I was left wondering how much of this movie had been cut out and left on the cutting room floor. Scenes normally required to get us to invest in some of these relationships (e.g. Josh & Alfie, Josh & Shipley or Colonel Howell & McBride) felt like they were missing to me. I don't want to complain about the run time because The Creator isn't a short movie but I was left wondering if they cleaved off a little more than they should have.My most prominent problem with The Creator was how easy to guess the overall arc of the plot was. I didn't discern what it was going to do minute by minute but you can get where the story will start, advance to and finish largely from the trailer. There are some surprises here and there but if you zoom out and observe the macro progression of the plot, this ground has been covered before. Cliche seems a little harsh of a description but The Creator still lacks something bold in where it decides to venture and I was a little disappointed by that.The Creator really falls between a 7-8 for me but this is one of the rare situations where I'm going to round down. The film is still a spectacle and if you can get over that the plot is a little recycled in certain respects, there's a lot here to enjoy. Gareth Edwards and his team deserve kudos for making The Creator a worthy theatre experience. But I still wasn't blown-away by this movie and I wanted it to really kick into the next gear to get past the 8/10 mark. The Creator is a solid science fiction adventure that is worth checking out on the biggest screen you can but outside of it's CGI and visual sensibilities, I don't think it will have the staying power to make the huge impact it's clearly swinging for."

The movie's message seemed to be America: bad; military: bad; Asia: good. And there didn't seem to be any compelling reason to root for the robots other than the fact that the kid was cute and the other AI were poor villagers. It seems to me that in order for a movie to be good, the message should be complex and universally compelling. I didn't get what the message was, other than what I previously stated. Literally every bad guy was white and American. It's either very biased or very patronizing. On the other hand, I did think the actors did a good job, and the cinematography was outstanding."
"The Creator","DanTheMan2150AD","28 September 2023",710,"7 years on from his last big screen venture with the phenomenal Rogue One, The Creator isn't quite the comeback I had hoped for director Gareth Edwards. Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid ""simulants"", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic."

Get this... it's based on ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No really, they FINALLY remade/rebooted/did a sequel to NOT A DAMN THING!! OMGOMG, I've waited my whole life for originality! TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!""Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be ""huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot. Some of these images are worthy of the pages of Simon Stålenhag.Here's hoping Edwards someday adapts some of his tales."

The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects. AND filmmakers everywhere should learn how a budget should be used."
"The Creator","prberg2","30 September 2023",510,"Oh, I really wanted to like this movie. Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important ""weapon/creation""? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way."
"The Creator","BA_Harrison","27 September 2023",510,"The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb."
"The Creator","weraqs","25 November 2023",710,"Walking into the theater, my expectations were a mix of excitement and curiosity, especially given the film's intriguing take on AI.From the get-go, ""The Creator"" impressed me with its use of the $80 million budget. The cinematography was nothing short of remarkable, reminding me of the visual flair seen in ""Blade Runner"" ""Elysium"", ""I, Robot"" and ""A. I."" The world-building was immersive, creating a believable and lived-in environment that drew me in.The performances, particularly the dynamic between Joshua and Alfie, were the highlights of the film for me. Their interactions brought depth to the story, and I found myself genuinely invested in their journey. However, as the plot progressed, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment.The story, which began with promise, started to unravel. The pacing felt rushed, and the plot became increasingly predictable. I noticed glaring plot holes that were hard to overlook, and the narrative lacked the depth I had hoped for. The ambitious theme of AI's humanity, which initially seemed thought-provoking, was undermined by the film's inability to maintain coherence.While I appreciated the technical brilliance of the film, including the special effects and sound design, the script was a letdown. It was as if the movie wanted to say something profound about AI and humanity but ended up glossing over these complex themes, opting instead for a more superficial treatment.The characters, aside from Joshua, felt one-dimensional. I struggled to connect with them emotionally, this emotional disconnect was particularly evident in the portrayal of the AI characters, including Alfie, who, despite being central to the story, lacked the depth to make their plight resonate with me.While ""The Creator"" started off with great potential, it ultimately left me feeling underwhelmed. The film excelled in its visual storytelling but fell short in its narrative execution. It was a visually captivating experience, but the lack of emotional depth and narrative coherence made it a disappointing outing for me. I walked out of the theater feeling that the movie, despite its grand aspirations, missed the mark in delivering a fully engaging and thought-provoking sci-fi experience. It could have been a masterpiece, but a missed opportunity at best."
"The Creator","FeastMode","28 September 2023",410,"Sigh. As a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was looking forward to this new original stand-alone sci-fi movie. And I left fully disappointed. It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie. It could not get me engaged or invested, which is not a difficult task for someone who loves movie as much as I do.(1 viewing, early access screening UltraScreen 9/27/2023)"
"The Creator","kgprophet","29 September 2023",510,"Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick ""The Gray Man"". ""Creator"" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in ""The Manchurian"". Or the chosen kid in ""The Last Airbender"". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in ""Willow"". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In ""Creator"", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of ""Chappie"" with a robot police force. It could also resemble ""Elysium"", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, ""Apocalypse Now""-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish ""assassin turned compassionate"" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go ""Huh?"" ""What?"". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping on the ""A. I."" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words ""Artificial Intelligence"" and ""A. I."" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making ""Rogue One: A Star Wars story"". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10."
"The Creator","Jim_Screechy","17 November 2023",510,"I watched this from start to finish without being drawn into the story at any point.I think John Washington is miscast here, I had the same exact experience when i watched Tenet... found myself very disconnected as I he didn't seem to make a proper connection with the role he was portraying.That is not to say the film isn't without issues. They have been fairly well documented by other reviewers so I'll not labour the points here.My main issue is with the lack of emotional involvment with the characters. The film measures zero on the emtional richter scale, but more, the screenplay just doesn't manage to get you excited or involved with anything that is unfolding. Additionally, the characters seem to have little connection to each other. In fact it is only at the end of the movie that Joshua and Alphie seem to have any tangible emotional cohesion.Contrast this with The Golden Child 1986 where Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell and the connection he makes to The Golden Child played by J. L. Reate. Here you can see what a great connection is established on screen and the massive difference in outcome it produces. Both films have two similar sets of pairings in almost identical scenarios with a stark contrast in outcome.Anyway, for me the film was a big dissapointment, I can't say John David Washington was the cause of this since the Movie has many other problematic aspects, but the ones I've mentioned were particularly significant for me.5/10 sadly."
"The Creator","davemanson","11 October 2023",410,"With stunning visuals reminiscent of Blade Runner and the more recent Rouge One this movie is stunning to look at. Unfortunately the script falls far short of living up to its inspired cinematography. It's full of plot holes and cringe worthy moments from it's extremely one dimensional villains. The plot twist are telegraphed from miles away and there are no real surprises to be had. Everything plays out exactly like you would expect it to. Which is a shame. The look and mood of this film is almost enough to save it. But in the end it falls flat and its potential is wasted. See it for the visuals. Forget it for its script."
"The Creator","kevin_robbins","30 September 2023",610,"My wife and I caught The Creator (2023) in theaters last night. The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once."
"The Creator","Lomax343","28 September 2023",610,"Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity."
"The Creator","alex_with_a_P","1 October 2023",410,"AI is such a rich topic, it can be explored from any kind of angles but this movie decided to use it only as a prop. The AI people are just stand-ins for oppressed people X. None of the AI people are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!), which is one of many advantages machines would have over humans. The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and in a better way.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Awkward change of tones, a weird plot structure with constant flashbacks, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas at play. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the 135min runtime, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to another.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country where the story takes place doesn't have military or a defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers will only be used for a door. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. The last action set piece in particular is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices. Next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. Mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, those have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their task of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing interesting. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. And I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only aesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame."
"The Creator","ethanbresnett","29 September 2023",710,"The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill.It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless.The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film.There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid.Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though."

Absolutely stunning work from director Gareth Edwards and cinematographer Oren Soffer. Shot on a Sony FX3 and on location. Impressive. From color grades, shots and VFX...all top notch. A visual spectacle.Although Gareth Edwards pulls through visually, he fails miserably on the storyline. The amount of times my party sat there and looked at each other saying ""wait, what? Why?"" was too much to count. Things didnt add up and begs the audience to question many things. As if Edwards was just trying to get to an ending rather than build the story. Creating that tension or closeness between ai and humans was lacking.John Washington's mono tone, emotionless acting contributed to that disconnect. The exact ""read off the script"" acting we saw in Tenet. How he got this role is mind blowing and nepotism at its finest. His performance was only saved by child actor Madeleine Voyles, who was great. Few other questionable casting decisions, you'll see if you choose to not wait for the stream (the soccer mom playing a ruthless captain)All in all, this film was entertaining at the very least. Could have been awesome as i love how rogue one was done and im not a star wars fanatic.Worth the ticket? Eh yea not bad but definitely not a rewatch. Oh and ill never watch anything with John Washington again lol."
"The Creator","RussHog","1 January 2024",810,"My friend told me if I saw this in theaters some of the gaping plot holes would stand out more - but as it is I saw it at home and frankly I could care less if there were some plot holes this is a very good film with incredible world building.It tells the story of human v AI and our hero is a former soldier who is sent to track down the AI's ultimate weapon. Turns out the weapon is a child AI - who may or may not have the secret to his seemingly dead wife's location - and now our hero betrays his people to keep the AI safe and try to find his wife.His journey with the AI takes him deep into the heart of this world, and he eventually grows to care for the AI and rebels against his own people. It may sound cliche, but these kinds of stories need to be told again and again.By no stretch of the imagination is this corny like Avatar, this was a very good by the numbers sci-fi movie. Well acted, great special effects, good action scenes, and a big heart with a cool final showdown.Def recommended, too bad I didn't watch this in theaters."
"The Creator","Darksidecrew","28 September 2023",NA,"This new sci-fi film from Gareth Edwards (Rogue One) was made for $80 million but looks like $350 million on screen. It's a global epic on a massive scale. This is how I like films to look, I think it was probably shot on digital but they've made it look like it was shot on film. It does have shades of Terminator, Blade Runner and even Terrence Malick but it also brings some new dimensions to some classic themes. Not only the craftsmanship but the acting is also top notch in this fully immersive tale. It moves very quickly which will help you get past sone story logistics that might crumble on closer examination. A superb effort that leaves the glossy soulless and often brainless blockbusters of recent decades in the dust. A quality film that I recommend supporting in the theaters."

"The Creator","nscoby93","29 September 2023",310,"That is literally all that comes to mind a disappointment. Going in, I genuinely wanted to like this movie. I mean the director of Rogue One doing a standalone new title sci-fi film. What could go wrong? Well, apparently, everything.Let me get through the positives because that's a short list. Good acting, a great concept, and an interesting world... um, that's it.So what's bad about this film? Well, literally everything else. The story is a mess and told equally as messy. The film is convulted and tries so hard to appear deep, intelligent, and emotional, yet it's all surface and is very plain to see how empty it truly is. Unfortunately, Hans Zimmers score does nothing here as the music just didn't stand out, so I was surprised to see that he composed the music.But I think what bothered me the most about this film is that it felt like a more annoying version of Avatar. Gareth Edward's, in my opinion, like James Cameron, shows absolutely no discretion on whom the audience should side with. It all comes off as manipulation and extremely biased. So humans bad, aliens good, turns into America/Western Culture bad, and New Asia/Eastern Culture good.There is no character on the side of the Americans aside from John David Washington's character who is ""good"" or likeable but on the side of the robots they are all victims and the people of New Asia are victims of the oppressive and evil Americans. Who are basically painted as this worlds version of the Empire. They even have a deadly space station. While the robots are the Rebel Alliance doing what they can to fight this evil.So obviously as a viewer and decent human being I won't side with the Americans but the film does nothing to prove to me these robots are the victims that Gareth Edward's so desperately wants me to believe. In fact, there's a sequence that proves to me the opposite that some of these robots will kill their own people to protect this child who is essentially a Christ like figure to the robots. There is absolutely no unbiased look at both sides in this Vietnam like conflict.Then, at the end of everything, the explanation as to the reason for this war is absolutely moronic, I'd say what it is, but that's touching on spoiler territory.The movie explains nothing in the way of what this AI is or how it became ""sentient,"" etc. Also, if these robots are so peaceful and innocent, then why not make an attempt at peace? But that wouldn't happen because America is evil and dead set on destroying all AI consciousness, so any peacetalks would undoubtedly fail. Edward's here expects the audience to take everything at face value and not question anything. Which is exactly what the liberal mind expects from you, so I shouldn't be surprised. Now, I wouldn't say Gareth Edward's is a liberal as I don't know the man, but he's playing with liberal ideologies.Then, the movie tries to be a social commentary on war, which fails miserable because it conflicts with the notion of the robots being all innocent victims. Essentially, the message being all war is unjust, and the ones who suffer the most are the innocent who get caught in the crossfire.So if this film truly wanted to show that war is the real enemy, then don't paint one side as innocent victims and paint the other as cruel, oppressive aggressors. Instead, put in some effort and show that both sides aren't innocent that both sides have done evil to one another.Finally the film is no where near as beautiful as trailers made it out to look, but I'm going to be honest here and say that's most likely due to the fact we watched this film in a crap auditorium. So, hopefully, upon a second viewing, which I do plan on having, it'll be with a better projector and screen. But also so much of this movie took place at night, which I could not understand why. Perhaps so they didn't have to show so much? I have no clue. The action, I guess, looked good, but I just didn't care for what was happening in it.Anyway, I will close things here and say I'm sure a great many people would disagree with me, but that's fine. These are the issues I had with this film, and they are simply my opinions. If you liked this movie, then great. I'm happy for you, but I am just genuinely disappointed. Though, after seeing the film, I can understand why it has mixed scores.IMDb: 3/10

"The Creator","Xstal","2 October 2023",510,"As the opening kicks off there's expectations, that the film that's being screened has firm foundations, and to be fair it's a good start, rise of machines is at its heart, as well as difference, evolving change and diverse nations. There are hints of lots of things you've seen before, wars of stars and running blades are all top drawer, but once the façade has been cracked, you'll feel as though you're being hacked, as the pace turns to a saunter, and starts to bore. At the end you'll find the steam has all escaped, that the barrel comes so close to being scraped, an apocalypse of ages, just another war that rages, you're disappointed as you leave, and your coats draped."
"The Creator","benjaminskylerhill","28 September 2023",910,"Gareth Edwards proves himself to be an astoundingly brilliant director with The Creator, as he crafts a visual and auditory world rich with layers of detail, and characters that we quickly understand and naturally grow over the course of the story.He made an $80 million movie that looks like it cost at least twice that. This cost less than half of what Thor: Love and Thunder cost. Let that sink in.Edwards shows he's a better director than writer, as the film is far from original, borrowing concepts and themes from plenty of old classic sci-fi stories. And it's also burdened with some clunky dialogue and rushed, convenient crucial plot points.Yeah, it's imperfect. But it's made with a confidence and care that goes beyond the degree of admirable. It's an earnest expression of love, redemption, sacrifice, and forgiveness put out by a filmmaker who really cares for the characters whose story he's telling.It's a work of art that, even with its flaws, deserves to be seen."
"The Creator","FixedYourEnding","17 November 2023",410,"This is going to be an unpopular review, I know. Maybe I was in the wrong mood coming into this movie, but I turned it off after 25 minutes, couldn't stand it anymore. The whole premise of American white males are constant war-mongers and do not understand progress. If you are an African American you *might* be ok, it helps if you are hurt or imperfect in some other way, if you are a minority then you should be protected and saved, etc etc.The story as a whole makes little sense and it is remains incoherent with empty dialogues and mediocre acting. Why bombs, why the war, it is not explained and when those questions are asked they reply is some sort of a joke, such as ""they are here for our jobs"". Also not explained why would someone remove his prosthetic arm before going to the pool but not his leg. Whatever.The only redeemable quality for this movie is the production value and the almost next-gen gaming-like scenario and photography. I guess if you can ignore everything else, and just look at the imagery you might enjoy it. I personally needed a little more, or actually quite a lot more.This is another polarizing creation. I fell on the ""don't like it"" side, two thumbs down for me. Looks like writers were on strike but CGI was on sale. Exact score: 44 / 100."
"The Creator","masonsaul","28 September 2023",810,"The Creator is an all too rare piece of original epic sci-fi that's built on very familiar foundations and uses them to create something that's as visually exciting as it is emotionally investing, completely unafraid to show American military might for the soulless monster it is.John David Washington plays his reluctant father figure in terrific fashion, closed off at first but those barriers are all successfully worn down by the end. In her screen debut Madeleine Yuna Voyles is amazing, adorable and undoubtedly the main reason any of this works on an emotional level.Supporting them is Ken Watanabe being as effortlessly stoic as always and Allison Janney as an antagonist with a solid amount of depth all thanks to just one scene which efficiently explains her viewpoint in a believable fashion but she's also just plain ruthless in her relentless pursuit.Gareth Edwards once again proves he doesn't need established franchises to create epic imagery or fascinating worlds on a blockbuster scale. Between the stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser & Oren Soffer and the ridiculously impressive CG it outdoes the majority of the competition on a fraction of the cost.Uncharacteristically for Gareth Edwards there's a fair few needle drops early on, the choices can be obvious but always effective and the music by Hans Zimmer is solid. It's mostly just fine up until the third act where it really comes to life and avoids feeling wasted."
"The Creator","CANpatbuck3664","20 October 2023",710,"Starting my review of the creator with some comments on the acting, I'm surprised at how meteoric John David Washington's rise to the top has been. He's a good actor for sure but he's not just ascending the staircase, he's jumping a few steps at a time. He's anchoring the Creator as our protagonist Joshua. I think he's good in the movie, he's brooding for what feels like most of the run time but when he's given a chance to either be funny in short bursts or vulnerable near the end, he gets the job done. Madeleine Yuna Voyles is fine as Alphie, she accomplishes what's required in any given scene and by the end of the movie, she does what she can in regards to selling the bond her character has with Joshua. It's hard to deliver a noteworthy performance as a child actor/actress and she's better than passable. I keep waiting for the Gemma Chan's breakout role but this is one of her better performances as Maya. She has chemistry with Washington but she's given little to do on her own. She's appropriately cast and she sticks the landing in her part. My two favourite performances were from the veteran members of the supporting cast in Ken Watanabe and Allison Janney as Harun and Colonel Howell respectively. Janney pushes the envelope just far enough without descending into being a cartoon character, her character's palpable hatred for the Simulants creates tension and the amount of disdain she conveys through just a look is impressive. Watanabe brings strength to Harun when he needs to but there's also a lot of warmth when his character is bonding with Alphie.Despite some solid work from the cast overall, I'd bet what's probably going to draw your attention in the marketing material for The Creator is the design of this dystopian world and how the war between humans and A. I. dazzles on the big screen. Gareth Edwards and his team weren't working with pennies but this is as impressive of a display for a science fiction movie that I've seen in quite a while. The cinematography is fantastic, the character design of the robots evoked Neil Blomkamp's work for me in the best way without ripping it off and the action set pieces are memorable enough to hold your interest. The movie is just as fantastical (or grounded depending on your opinion on the future of artificial intelligence) as any other sci-fi epic, but there's a beautiful mix of real imagination that keeps the movie grounded just enough that you can still take it seriously. I found it disarming that it was so excellently realized and even if you aren't enthralled by the story, The Creator is still a delight from a visual perspective.I would describe The Creator as story driven as opposed to character driven but we spend enough time with Joshua, Alphie and their friends and enemies to get to know them. I liked the work done on the characters but I wasn't emotionally invested in whether Josh and Maya were going to reunite or if Alphie would make it away safely. I don't want to point the finger at the scriptwriters or the creative team, I was left wondering how much of this movie had been cut out and left on the cutting room floor. Scenes normally required to get us to invest in some of these relationships (e.g. Josh & Alfie, Josh & Shipley or Colonel Howell & McBride) felt like they were missing to me. I don't want to complain about the run time because The Creator isn't a short movie but I was left wondering if they cleaved off a little more than they should have.My most prominent problem with The Creator was how easy to guess the overall arc of the plot was. I didn't discern what it was going to do minute by minute but you can get where the story will start, advance to and finish largely from the trailer. There are some surprises here and there but if you zoom out and observe the macro progression of the plot, this ground has been covered before. Cliche seems a little harsh of a description but The Creator still lacks something bold in where it decides to venture and I was a little disappointed by that.The Creator really falls between a 7-8 for me but this is one of the rare situations where I'm going to round down. The film is still a spectacle and if you can get over that the plot is a little recycled in certain respects, there's a lot here to enjoy. Gareth Edwards and his team deserve kudos for making The Creator a worthy theatre experience. But I still wasn't blown-away by this movie and I wanted it to really kick into the next gear to get past the 8/10 mark. The Creator is a solid science fiction adventure that is worth checking out on the biggest screen you can but outside of it's CGI and visual sensibilities, I don't think it will have the staying power to make the huge impact it's clearly swinging for."
"The Creator","Imshortok06","30 September 2023",510,"You know a movie is bad when you take your Asian immigrant dad to go watch it with you and the first thing he says after watching it is ""Okay, which communist wrote this?!"" The movie's message seemed to be America: bad; military: bad; Asia: good. And there didn't seem to be any compelling reason to root for the robots other than the fact that the kid was cute and the other AI were poor villagers. It seems to me that in order for a movie to be good, the message should be complex and universally compelling. I didn't get what the message was, other than what I previously stated. Literally every bad guy was white and American. It's either very biased or very patronizing. On the other hand, I did think the actors did a good job, and the cinematography was outstanding."
"The Creator","DanTheMan2150AD","28 September 2023",710,"7 years on from his last big screen venture with the phenomenal Rogue One, The Creator isn't quite the comeback I had hoped for director Gareth Edwards. Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid ""simulants"", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic."
"The Creator","TheVictoriousV","1 October 2023",510,"When the trailer for The Creator came out, I basically became a Facebook Disney fangirl but, like, the opposite.I was all ""OMGOMG it's a big Hollywood sci-fi movie but, like, it's made by a director with a voice and... Get this... it's based on ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No really, they FINALLY remade/rebooted/did a sequel to NOT A DAMN THING!! OMGOMG, I've waited my whole life for originality! TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!""Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be ""huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot. Some of these images are worthy of the pages of Simon Stålenhag.Here's hoping Edwards someday adapts some of his tales."
"The Creator","poseyfan","29 September 2023",710,"This is a lesson to the movie industry on how to use a budget. 80 million dollars was used splendidly. The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects. AND filmmakers everywhere should learn how a budget should be used."
"The Creator","prberg2","30 September 2023",510,"Oh, I really wanted to like this movie. Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important ""weapon/creation""? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way."
"The Creator","BA_Harrison","27 September 2023",510,"The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb."
"The Creator","weraqs","25 November 2023",710,"Walking into the theater, my expectations were a mix of excitement and curiosity, especially given the film's intriguing take on AI.From the get-go, ""The Creator"" impressed me with its use of the $80 million budget. The cinematography was nothing short of remarkable, reminding me of the visual flair seen in ""Blade Runner"" ""Elysium"", ""I, Robot"" and ""A. I."" The world-building was immersive, creating a believable and lived-in environment that drew me in.The performances, particularly the dynamic between Joshua and Alfie, were the highlights of the film for me. Their interactions brought depth to the story, and I found myself genuinely invested in their journey. However, as the plot progressed, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment.The story, which began with promise, started to unravel. The pacing felt rushed, and the plot became increasingly predictable. I noticed glaring plot holes that were hard to overlook, and the narrative lacked the depth I had hoped for. The ambitious theme of AI's humanity, which initially seemed thought-provoking, was undermined by the film's inability to maintain coherence.While I appreciated the technical brilliance of the film, including the special effects and sound design, the script was a letdown. It was as if the movie wanted to say something profound about AI and humanity but ended up glossing over these complex themes, opting instead for a more superficial treatment.The characters, aside from Joshua, felt one-dimensional. I struggled to connect with them emotionally, this emotional disconnect was particularly evident in the portrayal of the AI characters, including Alfie, who, despite being central to the story, lacked the depth to make their plight resonate with me.While ""The Creator"" started off with great potential, it ultimately left me feeling underwhelmed. The film excelled in its visual storytelling but fell short in its narrative execution. It was a visually captivating experience, but the lack of emotional depth and narrative coherence made it a disappointing outing for me. I walked out of the theater feeling that the movie, despite its grand aspirations, missed the mark in delivering a fully engaging and thought-provoking sci-fi experience. It could have been a masterpiece, but a missed opportunity at best."
"The Creator","FeastMode","28 September 2023",410,"Sigh. As a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was looking forward to this new original stand-alone sci-fi movie. And I left fully disappointed. It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie. It could not get me engaged or invested, which is not a difficult task for someone who loves movie as much as I do.(1 viewing, early access screening UltraScreen 9/27/2023)"
"The Creator","kgprophet","29 September 2023",510,"Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick ""The Gray Man"". ""Creator"" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in ""The Manchurian"". Or the chosen kid in ""The Last Airbender"". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in ""Willow"". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In ""Creator"", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of ""Chappie"" with a robot police force. It could also resemble ""Elysium"", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, ""Apocalypse Now""-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish ""assassin turned compassionate"" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go ""Huh?"" ""What?"". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping on the ""A. I."" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words ""Artificial Intelligence"" and ""A. I."" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making ""Rogue One: A Star Wars story"". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10."
"The Creator","Jim_Screechy","17 November 2023",510,"I watched this from start to finish without being drawn into the story at any point.I think John Washington is miscast here, I had the same exact experience when i watched Tenet... found myself very disconnected as I he didn't seem to make a proper connection with the role he was portraying.That is not to say the film isn't without issues. They have been fairly well documented by other reviewers so I'll not labour the points here.My main issue is with the lack of emotional involvment with the characters. The film measures zero on the emtional richter scale, but more, the screenplay just doesn't manage to get you excited or involved with anything that is unfolding. Additionally, the characters seem to have little connection to each other. In fact it is only at the end of the movie that Joshua and Alphie seem to have any tangible emotional cohesion.Contrast this with The Golden Child 1986 where Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell and the connection he makes to The Golden Child played by J. L. Reate. Here you can see what a great connection is established on screen and the massive difference in outcome it produces. Both films have two similar sets of pairings in almost identical scenarios with a stark contrast in outcome.Anyway, for me the film was a big dissapointment, I can't say John David Washington was the cause of this since the Movie has many other problematic aspects, but the ones I've mentioned were particularly significant for me.5/10 sadly."
"The Creator","davemanson","11 October 2023",410,"With stunning visuals reminiscent of Blade Runner and the more recent Rouge One this movie is stunning to look at. Unfortunately the script falls far short of living up to its inspired cinematography. It's full of plot holes and cringe worthy moments from it's extremely one dimensional villains. The plot twist are telegraphed from miles away and there are no real surprises to be had. Everything plays out exactly like you would expect it to. Which is a shame. The look and mood of this film is almost enough to save it. But in the end it falls flat and its potential is wasted. See it for the visuals. Forget it for its script."
"The Creator","kevin_robbins","30 September 2023",610,"My wife and I caught The Creator (2023) in theaters last night. The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once."
"The Creator","Lomax343","28 September 2023",610,"Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity."
"The Creator","alex_with_a_P","1 October 2023",410,"AI is such a rich topic, it can be explored from any kind of angles but this movie decided to use it only as a prop. The AI people are just stand-ins for oppressed people X. None of the AI people are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!), which is one of many advantages machines would have over humans. The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and in a better way.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Awkward change of tones, a weird plot structure with constant flashbacks, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas at play. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the 135min runtime, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to another.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country where the story takes place doesn't have military or a defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers will only be used for a door. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. The last action set piece in particular is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices. Next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. Mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, those have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their task of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing interesting. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. And I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only aesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame."
"The Creator","ethanbresnett","29 September 2023",710,"The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill.It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless.The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film.There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid.Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though."

Absolutely stunning work from director Gareth Edwards and cinematographer Oren Soffer. Shot on a Sony FX3 and on location. Impressive. From color grades, shots and VFX...all top notch. A visual spectacle.Although Gareth Edwards pulls through visually, he fails miserably on the storyline. The amount of times my party sat there and looked at each other saying ""wait, what? Why?"" was too much to count. Things didnt add up and begs the audience to question many things. As if Edwards was just trying to get to an ending rather than build the story. Creating that tension or closeness between ai and humans was lacking.John Washington's mono tone, emotionless acting contributed to that disconnect. The exact ""read off the script"" acting we saw in Tenet. How he got this role is mind blowing and nepotism at its finest. His performance was only saved by child actor Madeleine Voyles, who was great. Few other questionable casting decisions, you'll see if you choose to not wait for the stream (the soccer mom playing a ruthless captain)All in all, this film was entertaining at the very least. Could have been awesome as i love how rogue one was done and im not a star wars fanatic.Worth the ticket? Eh yea not bad but definitely not a rewatch. Oh and ill never watch anything with John Washington again lol."
"The Creator","RussHog","1 January 2024",810,"My friend told me if I saw this in theaters some of the gaping plot holes would stand out more - but as it is I saw it at home and frankly I could care less if there were some plot holes this is a very good film with incredible world building.It tells the story of human v AI and our hero is a former soldier who is sent to track down the AI's ultimate weapon. Turns out the weapon is a child AI - who may or may not have the secret to his seemingly dead wife's location - and now our hero betrays his people to keep the AI safe and try to find his wife.His journey with the AI takes him deep into the heart of this world, and he eventually grows to care for the AI and rebels against his own people. It may sound cliche, but these kinds of stories need to be told again and again.By no stretch of the imagination is this corny like Avatar, this was a very good by the numbers sci-fi movie. Well acted, great special effects, good action scenes, and a big heart with a cool final showdown.Def recommended, too bad I didn't watch this in theaters."
"The Creator","Darksidecrew","28 September 2023",NA,"This new sci-fi film from Gareth Edwards (Rogue One) was made for $80 million but looks like $350 million on screen. It's a global epic on a massive scale. This is how I like films to look, I think it was probably shot on digital but they've made it look like it was shot on film. It does have shades of Terminator, Blade Runner and even Terrence Malick but it also brings some new dimensions to some classic themes. Not only the craftsmanship but the acting is also top notch in this fully immersive tale. It moves very quickly which will help you get past sone story logistics that might crumble on closer examination. A superb effort that leaves the glossy soulless and often brainless blockbusters of recent decades in the dust. A quality film that I recommend supporting in the theaters."

"The Creator","nscoby93","29 September 2023",310,"That is literally all that comes to mind a disappointment. Going in, I genuinely wanted to like this movie. I mean the director of Rogue One doing a standalone new title sci-fi film. What could go wrong? Well, apparently, everything.Let me get through the positives because that's a short list. Good acting, a great concept, and an interesting world... um, that's it.So what's bad about this film? Well, literally everything else. The story is a mess and told equally as messy. The film is convulted and tries so hard to appear deep, intelligent, and emotional, yet it's all surface and is very plain to see how empty it truly is. Unfortunately, Hans Zimmers score does nothing here as the music just didn't stand out, so I was surprised to see that he composed the music.But I think what bothered me the most about this film is that it felt like a more annoying version of Avatar. Gareth Edward's, in my opinion, like James Cameron, shows absolutely no discretion on whom the audience should side with. It all comes off as manipulation and extremely biased. So humans bad, aliens good, turns into America/Western Culture bad, and New Asia/Eastern Culture good.There is no character on the side of the Americans aside from John David Washington's character who is ""good"" or likeable but on the side of the robots they are all victims and the people of New Asia are victims of the oppressive and evil Americans. Who are basically painted as this worlds version of the Empire. They even have a deadly space station. While the robots are the Rebel Alliance doing what they can to fight this evil.So obviously as a viewer and decent human being I won't side with the Americans but the film does nothing to prove to me these robots are the victims that Gareth Edward's so desperately wants me to believe. In fact, there's a sequence that proves to me the opposite that some of these robots will kill their own people to protect this child who is essentially a Christ like figure to the robots. There is absolutely no unbiased look at both sides in this Vietnam like conflict.Then, at the end of everything, the explanation as to the reason for this war is absolutely moronic, I'd say what it is, but that's touching on spoiler territory.The movie explains nothing in the way of what this AI is or how it became ""sentient,"" etc. Also, if these robots are so peaceful and innocent, then why not make an attempt at peace? But that wouldn't happen because America is evil and dead set on destroying all AI consciousness, so any peacetalks would undoubtedly fail. Edward's here expects the audience to take everything at face value and not question anything. Which is exactly what the liberal mind expects from you, so I shouldn't be surprised. Now, I wouldn't say Gareth Edward's is a liberal as I don't know the man, but he's playing with liberal ideologies.Then, the movie tries to be a social commentary on war, which fails miserable because it conflicts with the notion of the robots being all innocent victims. Essentially, the message being all war is unjust, and the ones who suffer the most are the innocent who get caught in the crossfire.So if this film truly wanted to show that war is the real enemy, then don't paint one side as innocent victims and paint the other as cruel, oppressive aggressors. Instead, put in some effort and show that both sides aren't innocent that both sides have done evil to one another.Finally the film is no where near as beautiful as trailers made it out to look, but I'm going to be honest here and say that's most likely due to the fact we watched this film in a crap auditorium. So, hopefully, upon a second viewing, which I do plan on having, it'll be with a better projector and screen. But also so much of this movie took place at night, which I could not understand why. Perhaps so they didn't have to show so much? I have no clue. The action, I guess, looked good, but I just didn't care for what was happening in it.Anyway, I will close things here and say I'm sure a great many people would disagree with me, but that's fine. These are the issues I had with this film, and they are simply my opinions. If you liked this movie, then great. I'm happy for you, but I am just genuinely disappointed. Though, after seeing the film, I can understand why it has mixed scores.IMDb: 3/10
Letterboxd: 2/5Watched in Theaters."
"The Creator","Xstal","2 October 2023",510,"As the opening kicks off there's expectations, that the film that's being screened has firm foundations, and to be fair it's a good start, rise of machines is at its heart, as well as difference, evolving change and diverse nations. There are hints of lots of things you've seen before, wars of stars and running blades are all top drawer, but once the façade has been cracked, you'll feel as though you're being hacked, as the pace turns to a saunter, and starts to bore. At the end you'll find the steam has all escaped, that the barrel comes so close to being scraped, an apocalypse of ages, just another war that rages, you're disappointed as you leave, and your coats draped."
"The Creator","benjaminskylerhill","28 September 2023",910,"Gareth Edwards proves himself to be an astoundingly brilliant director with The Creator, as he crafts a visual and auditory world rich with layers of detail, and characters that we quickly understand and naturally grow over the course of the story.He made an $80 million movie that looks like it cost at least twice that. This cost less than half of what Thor: Love and Thunder cost. Let that sink in.Edwards shows he's a better director than writer, as the film is far from original, borrowing concepts and themes from plenty of old classic sci-fi stories. And it's also burdened with some clunky dialogue and rushed, convenient crucial plot points.Yeah, it's imperfect. But it's made with a confidence and care that goes beyond the degree of admirable. It's an earnest expression of love, redemption, sacrifice, and forgiveness put out by a filmmaker who really cares for the characters whose story he's telling.It's a work of art that, even with its flaws, deserves to be seen."
"The Creator","FixedYourEnding","17 November 2023",410,"This is going to be an unpopular review, I know. Maybe I was in the wrong mood coming into this movie, but I turned it off after 25 minutes, couldn't stand it anymore. The whole premise of American white males are constant war-mongers and do not understand progress. If you are an African American you *might* be ok, it helps if you are hurt or imperfect in some other way, if you are a minority then you should be protected and saved, etc etc.The story as a whole makes little sense and it is remains incoherent with empty dialogues and mediocre acting. Why bombs, why the war, it is not explained and when those questions are asked they reply is some sort of a joke, such as ""they are here for our jobs"". Also not explained why would someone remove his prosthetic arm before going to the pool but not his leg. Whatever.The only redeemable quality for this movie is the production value and the almost next-gen gaming-like scenario and photography. I guess if you can ignore everything else, and just look at the imagery you might enjoy it. I personally needed a little more, or actually quite a lot more.This is another polarizing creation. I fell on the ""don't like it"" side, two thumbs down for me. Looks like writers were on strike but CGI was on sale. Exact score: 44 / 100."
"The Creator","masonsaul","28 September 2023",810,"The Creator is an all too rare piece of original epic sci-fi that's built on very familiar foundations and uses them to create something that's as visually exciting as it is emotionally investing, completely unafraid to show American military might for the soulless monster it is.John David Washington plays his reluctant father figure in terrific fashion, closed off at first but those barriers are all successfully worn down by the end. In her screen debut Madeleine Yuna Voyles is amazing, adorable and undoubtedly the main reason any of this works on an emotional level.Supporting them is Ken Watanabe being as effortlessly stoic as always and Allison Janney as an antagonist with a solid amount of depth all thanks to just one scene which efficiently explains her viewpoint in a believable fashion but she's also just plain ruthless in her relentless pursuit.Gareth Edwards once again proves he doesn't need established franchises to create epic imagery or fascinating worlds on a blockbuster scale. Between the stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser & Oren Soffer and the ridiculously impressive CG it outdoes the majority of the competition on a fraction of the cost.Uncharacteristically for Gareth Edwards there's a fair few needle drops early on, the choices can be obvious but always effective and the music by Hans Zimmer is solid. It's mostly just fine up until the third act where it really comes to life and avoids feeling wasted."
"The Creator","CANpatbuck3664","20 October 2023",710,"Starting my review of the creator with some comments on the acting, I'm surprised at how meteoric John David Washington's rise to the top has been. He's a good actor for sure but he's not just ascending the staircase, he's jumping a few steps at a time. He's anchoring the Creator as our protagonist Joshua. I think he's good in the movie, he's brooding for what feels like most of the run time but when he's given a chance to either be funny in short bursts or vulnerable near the end, he gets the job done. Madeleine Yuna Voyles is fine as Alphie, she accomplishes what's required in any given scene and by the end of the movie, she does what she can in regards to selling the bond her character has with Joshua. It's hard to deliver a noteworthy performance as a child actor/actress and she's better than passable. I keep waiting for the Gemma Chan's breakout role but this is one of her better performances as Maya. She has chemistry with Washington but she's given little to do on her own. She's appropriately cast and she sticks the landing in her part. My two favourite performances were from the veteran members of the supporting cast in Ken Watanabe and Allison Janney as Harun and Colonel Howell respectively. Janney pushes the envelope just far enough without descending into being a cartoon character, her character's palpable hatred for the Simulants creates tension and the amount of disdain she conveys through just a look is impressive. Watanabe brings strength to Harun when he needs to but there's also a lot of warmth when his character is bonding with Alphie.Despite some solid work from the cast overall, I'd bet what's probably going to draw your attention in the marketing material for The Creator is the design of this dystopian world and how the war between humans and A. I. dazzles on the big screen. Gareth Edwards and his team weren't working with pennies but this is as impressive of a display for a science fiction movie that I've seen in quite a while. The cinematography is fantastic, the character design of the robots evoked Neil Blomkamp's work for me in the best way without ripping it off and the action set pieces are memorable enough to hold your interest. The movie is just as fantastical (or grounded depending on your opinion on the future of artificial intelligence) as any other sci-fi epic, but there's a beautiful mix of real imagination that keeps the movie grounded just enough that you can still take it seriously. I found it disarming that it was so excellently realized and even if you aren't enthralled by the story, The Creator is still a delight from a visual perspective.I would describe The Creator as story driven as opposed to character driven but we spend enough time with Joshua, Alphie and their friends and enemies to get to know them. I liked the work done on the characters but I wasn't emotionally invested in whether Josh and Maya were going to reunite or if Alphie would make it away safely. I don't want to point the finger at the scriptwriters or the creative team, I was left wondering how much of this movie had been cut out and left on the cutting room floor. Scenes normally required to get us to invest in some of these relationships (e.g. Josh & Alfie, Josh & Shipley or Colonel Howell & McBride) felt like they were missing to me. I don't want to complain about the run time because The Creator isn't a short movie but I was left wondering if they cleaved off a little more than they should have.My most prominent problem with The Creator was how easy to guess the overall arc of the plot was. I didn't discern what it was going to do minute by minute but you can get where the story will start, advance to and finish largely from the trailer. There are some surprises here and there but if you zoom out and observe the macro progression of the plot, this ground has been covered before. Cliche seems a little harsh of a description but The Creator still lacks something bold in where it decides to venture and I was a little disappointed by that.The Creator really falls between a 7-8 for me but this is one of the rare situations where I'm going to round down. The film is still a spectacle and if you can get over that the plot is a little recycled in certain respects, there's a lot here to enjoy. Gareth Edwards and his team deserve kudos for making The Creator a worthy theatre experience. But I still wasn't blown-away by this movie and I wanted it to really kick into the next gear to get past the 8/10 mark. The Creator is a solid science fiction adventure that is worth checking out on the biggest screen you can but outside of it's CGI and visual sensibilities, I don't think it will have the staying power to make the huge impact it's clearly swinging for."
"The Creator","Imshortok06","30 September 2023",510,"You know a movie is bad when you take your Asian immigrant dad to go watch it with you and the first thing he says after watching it is ""Okay, which communist wrote this?!"" The movie's message seemed to be America: bad; military: bad; Asia: good. And there didn't seem to be any compelling reason to root for the robots other than the fact that the kid was cute and the other AI were poor villagers. It seems to me that in order for a movie to be good, the message should be complex and universally compelling. I didn't get what the message was, other than what I previously stated. Literally every bad guy was white and American. It's either very biased or very patronizing. On the other hand, I did think the actors did a good job, and the cinematography was outstanding."
"The Creator","DanTheMan2150AD","28 September 2023",710,"7 years on from his last big screen venture with the phenomenal Rogue One, The Creator isn't quite the comeback I had hoped for director Gareth Edwards. Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid ""simulants"", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic."
"The Creator","TheVictoriousV","1 October 2023",510,"When the trailer for The Creator came out, I basically became a Facebook Disney fangirl but, like, the opposite.I was all ""OMGOMG it's a big Hollywood sci-fi movie but, like, it's made by a director with a voice and... Get this... it's based on ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No really, they FINALLY remade/rebooted/did a sequel to NOT A DAMN THING!! OMGOMG, I've waited my whole life for originality! TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!""Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be ""huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot. Some of these images are worthy of the pages of Simon Stålenhag.Here's hoping Edwards someday adapts some of his tales."
"The Creator","poseyfan","29 September 2023",710,"This is a lesson to the movie industry on how to use a budget. 80 million dollars was used splendidly. The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects. AND filmmakers everywhere should learn how a budget should be used."
"The Creator","prberg2","30 September 2023",510,"Oh, I really wanted to like this movie. Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important ""weapon/creation""? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way."
"The Creator","BA_Harrison","27 September 2023",510,"The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb."
"The Creator","weraqs","25 November 2023",710,"Walking into the theater, my expectations were a mix of excitement and curiosity, especially given the film's intriguing take on AI.From the get-go, ""The Creator"" impressed me with its use of the $80 million budget. The cinematography was nothing short of remarkable, reminding me of the visual flair seen in ""Blade Runner"" ""Elysium"", ""I, Robot"" and ""A. I."" The world-building was immersive, creating a believable and lived-in environment that drew me in.The performances, particularly the dynamic between Joshua and Alfie, were the highlights of the film for me. Their interactions brought depth to the story, and I found myself genuinely invested in their journey. However, as the plot progressed, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment.The story, which began with promise, started to unravel. The pacing felt rushed, and the plot became increasingly predictable. I noticed glaring plot holes that were hard to overlook, and the narrative lacked the depth I had hoped for. The ambitious theme of AI's humanity, which initially seemed thought-provoking, was undermined by the film's inability to maintain coherence.While I appreciated the technical brilliance of the film, including the special effects and sound design, the script was a letdown. It was as if the movie wanted to say something profound about AI and humanity but ended up glossing over these complex themes, opting instead for a more superficial treatment.The characters, aside from Joshua, felt one-dimensional. I struggled to connect with them emotionally, this emotional disconnect was particularly evident in the portrayal of the AI characters, including Alfie, who, despite being central to the story, lacked the depth to make their plight resonate with me.While ""The Creator"" started off with great potential, it ultimately left me feeling underwhelmed. The film excelled in its visual storytelling but fell short in its narrative execution. It was a visually captivating experience, but the lack of emotional depth and narrative coherence made it a disappointing outing for me. I walked out of the theater feeling that the movie, despite its grand aspirations, missed the mark in delivering a fully engaging and thought-provoking sci-fi experience. It could have been a masterpiece, but a missed opportunity at best."
"The Creator","FeastMode","28 September 2023",410,"Sigh. As a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was looking forward to this new original stand-alone sci-fi movie. And I left fully disappointed. It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie. It could not get me engaged or invested, which is not a difficult task for someone who loves movie as much as I do.(1 viewing, early access screening UltraScreen 9/27/2023)"
"The Creator","kgprophet","29 September 2023",510,"Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick ""The Gray Man"". ""Creator"" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in ""The Manchurian"". Or the chosen kid in ""The Last Airbender"". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in ""Willow"". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In ""Creator"", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of ""Chappie"" with a robot police force. It could also resemble ""Elysium"", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, ""Apocalypse Now""-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish ""assassin turned compassionate"" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go ""Huh?"" ""What?"". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping on the ""A. I."" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words ""Artificial Intelligence"" and ""A. I."" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making ""Rogue One: A Star Wars story"". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10."
"The Creator","Jim_Screechy","17 November 2023",510,"I watched this from start to finish without being drawn into the story at any point.I think John Washington is miscast here, I had the same exact experience when i watched Tenet... found myself very disconnected as I he didn't seem to make a proper connection with the role he was portraying.That is not to say the film isn't without issues. They have been fairly well documented by other reviewers so I'll not labour the points here.My main issue is with the lack of emotional involvment with the characters. The film measures zero on the emtional richter scale, but more, the screenplay just doesn't manage to get you excited or involved with anything that is unfolding. Additionally, the characters seem to have little connection to each other. In fact it is only at the end of the movie that Joshua and Alphie seem to have any tangible emotional cohesion.Contrast this with The Golden Child 1986 where Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell and the connection he makes to The Golden Child played by J. L. Reate. Here you can see what a great connection is established on screen and the massive difference in outcome it produces. Both films have two similar sets of pairings in almost identical scenarios with a stark contrast in outcome.Anyway, for me the film was a big dissapointment, I can't say John David Washington was the cause of this since the Movie has many other problematic aspects, but the ones I've mentioned were particularly significant for me.5/10 sadly."
"The Creator","davemanson","11 October 2023",410,"With stunning visuals reminiscent of Blade Runner and the more recent Rouge One this movie is stunning to look at. Unfortunately the script falls far short of living up to its inspired cinematography. It's full of plot holes and cringe worthy moments from it's extremely one dimensional villains. The plot twist are telegraphed from miles away and there are no real surprises to be had. Everything plays out exactly like you would expect it to. Which is a shame. The look and mood of this film is almost enough to save it. But in the end it falls flat and its potential is wasted. See it for the visuals. Forget it for its script."
"The Creator","kevin_robbins","30 September 2023",610,"My wife and I caught The Creator (2023) in theaters last night. The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once."
"The Creator","Lomax343","28 September 2023",610,"Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity."
"The Creator","alex_with_a_P","1 October 2023",410,"AI is such a rich topic, it can be explored from any kind of angles but this movie decided to use it only as a prop. The AI people are just stand-ins for oppressed people X. None of the AI people are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!), which is one of many advantages machines would have over humans. The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and in a better way.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Awkward change of tones, a weird plot structure with constant flashbacks, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas at play. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the 135min runtime, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to another.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country where the story takes place doesn't have military or a defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers will only be used for a door. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. The last action set piece in particular is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices. Next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. Mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, those have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their task of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing interesting. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. And I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only aesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame."
"The Creator","ethanbresnett","29 September 2023",710,"The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill.It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless.The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film.There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid.Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though."

Absolutely stunning work from director Gareth Edwards and cinematographer Oren Soffer. Shot on a Sony FX3 and on location. Impressive. From color grades, shots and VFX...all top notch. A visual spectacle.Although Gareth Edwards pulls through visually, he fails miserably on the storyline. The amount of times my party sat there and looked at each other saying ""wait, what? Why?"" was too much to count. Things didnt add up and begs the audience to question many things. As if Edwards was just trying to get to an ending rather than build the story. Creating that tension or closeness between ai and humans was lacking.John Washington's mono tone, emotionless acting contributed to that disconnect. The exact ""read off the script"" acting we saw in Tenet. How he got this role is mind blowing and nepotism at its finest. His performance was only saved by child actor Madeleine Voyles, who was great. Few other questionable casting decisions, you'll see if you choose to not wait for the stream (the soccer mom playing a ruthless captain)All in all, this film was entertaining at the very least. Could have been awesome as i love how rogue one was done and im not a star wars fanatic.Worth the ticket? Eh yea not bad but definitely not a rewatch. Oh and ill never watch anything with John Washington again lol."
"The Creator","RussHog","1 January 2024",810,"My friend told me if I saw this in theaters some of the gaping plot holes would stand out more - but as it is I saw it at home and frankly I could care less if there were some plot holes this is a very good film with incredible world building.It tells the story of human v AI and our hero is a former soldier who is sent to track down the AI's ultimate weapon. Turns out the weapon is a child AI - who may or may not have the secret to his seemingly dead wife's location - and now our hero betrays his people to keep the AI safe and try to find his wife.His journey with the AI takes him deep into the heart of this world, and he eventually grows to care for the AI and rebels against his own people. It may sound cliche, but these kinds of stories need to be told again and again.By no stretch of the imagination is this corny like Avatar, this was a very good by the numbers sci-fi movie. Well acted, great special effects, good action scenes, and a big heart with a cool final showdown.Def recommended, too bad I didn't watch this in theaters."
"The Creator","Darksidecrew","28 September 2023",NA,"This new sci-fi film from Gareth Edwards (Rogue One) was made for $80 million but looks like $350 million on screen. It's a global epic on a massive scale. This is how I like films to look, I think it was probably shot on digital but they've made it look like it was shot on film. It does have shades of Terminator, Blade Runner and even Terrence Malick but it also brings some new dimensions to some classic themes. Not only the craftsmanship but the acting is also top notch in this fully immersive tale. It moves very quickly which will help you get past sone story logistics that might crumble on closer examination. A superb effort that leaves the glossy soulless and often brainless blockbusters of recent decades in the dust. A quality film that I recommend supporting in the theaters."

"The Creator","nscoby93","29 September 2023",310,"That is literally all that comes to mind a disappointment. Going in, I genuinely wanted to like this movie. I mean the director of Rogue One doing a standalone new title sci-fi film. What could go wrong? Well, apparently, everything.Let me get through the positives because that's a short list. Good acting, a great concept, and an interesting world... um, that's it.So what's bad about this film? Well, literally everything else. The story is a mess and told equally as messy. The film is convulted and tries so hard to appear deep, intelligent, and emotional, yet it's all surface and is very plain to see how empty it truly is. Unfortunately, Hans Zimmers score does nothing here as the music just didn't stand out, so I was surprised to see that he composed the music.But I think what bothered me the most about this film is that it felt like a more annoying version of Avatar. Gareth Edward's, in my opinion, like James Cameron, shows absolutely no discretion on whom the audience should side with. It all comes off as manipulation and extremely biased. So humans bad, aliens good, turns into America/Western Culture bad, and New Asia/Eastern Culture good.There is no character on the side of the Americans aside from John David Washington's character who is ""good"" or likeable but on the side of the robots they are all victims and the people of New Asia are victims of the oppressive and evil Americans. Who are basically painted as this worlds version of the Empire. They even have a deadly space station. While the robots are the Rebel Alliance doing what they can to fight this evil.So obviously as a viewer and decent human being I won't side with the Americans but the film does nothing to prove to me these robots are the victims that Gareth Edward's so desperately wants me to believe. In fact, there's a sequence that proves to me the opposite that some of these robots will kill their own people to protect this child who is essentially a Christ like figure to the robots. There is absolutely no unbiased look at both sides in this Vietnam like conflict.Then, at the end of everything, the explanation as to the reason for this war is absolutely moronic, I'd say what it is, but that's touching on spoiler territory.The movie explains nothing in the way of what this AI is or how it became ""sentient,"" etc. Also, if these robots are so peaceful and innocent, then why not make an attempt at peace? But that wouldn't happen because America is evil and dead set on destroying all AI consciousness, so any peacetalks would undoubtedly fail. Edward's here expects the audience to take everything at face value and not question anything. Which is exactly what the liberal mind expects from you, so I shouldn't be surprised. Now, I wouldn't say Gareth Edward's is a liberal as I don't know the man, but he's playing with liberal ideologies.Then, the movie tries to be a social commentary on war, which fails miserable because it conflicts with the notion of the robots being all innocent victims. Essentially, the message being all war is unjust, and the ones who suffer the most are the innocent who get caught in the crossfire.So if this film truly wanted to show that war is the real enemy, then don't paint one side as innocent victims and paint the other as cruel, oppressive aggressors. Instead, put in some effort and show that both sides aren't innocent that both sides have done evil to one another.Finally the film is no where near as beautiful as trailers made it out to look, but I'm going to be honest here and say that's most likely due to the fact we watched this film in a crap auditorium. So, hopefully, upon a second viewing, which I do plan on having, it'll be with a better projector and screen. But also so much of this movie took place at night, which I could not understand why. Perhaps so they didn't have to show so much? I have no clue. The action, I guess, looked good, but I just didn't care for what was happening in it.Anyway, I will close things here and say I'm sure a great many people would disagree with me, but that's fine. These are the issues I had with this film, and they are simply my opinions. If you liked this movie, then great. I'm happy for you, but I am just genuinely disappointed. Though, after seeing the film, I can understand why it has mixed scores.IMDb: 3/10
Letterboxd: 2/5Watched in Theaters."
"The Creator","Xstal","2 October 2023",510,"As the opening kicks off there's expectations, that the film that's being screened has firm foundations, and to be fair it's a good start, rise of machines is at its heart, as well as difference, evolving change and diverse nations. There are hints of lots of things you've seen before, wars of stars and running blades are all top drawer, but once the façade has been cracked, you'll feel as though you're being hacked, as the pace turns to a saunter, and starts to bore. At the end you'll find the steam has all escaped, that the barrel comes so close to being scraped, an apocalypse of ages, just another war that rages, you're disappointed as you leave, and your coats draped."
"The Creator","benjaminskylerhill","28 September 2023",910,"Gareth Edwards proves himself to be an astoundingly brilliant director with The Creator, as he crafts a visual and auditory world rich with layers of detail, and characters that we quickly understand and naturally grow over the course of the story.He made an $80 million movie that looks like it cost at least twice that. This cost less than half of what Thor: Love and Thunder cost. Let that sink in.Edwards shows he's a better director than writer, as the film is far from original, borrowing concepts and themes from plenty of old classic sci-fi stories. And it's also burdened with some clunky dialogue and rushed, convenient crucial plot points.Yeah, it's imperfect. But it's made with a confidence and care that goes beyond the degree of admirable. It's an earnest expression of love, redemption, sacrifice, and forgiveness put out by a filmmaker who really cares for the characters whose story he's telling.It's a work of art that, even with its flaws, deserves to be seen."
"The Creator","FixedYourEnding","17 November 2023",410,"This is going to be an unpopular review, I know. Maybe I was in the wrong mood coming into this movie, but I turned it off after 25 minutes, couldn't stand it anymore. The whole premise of American white males are constant war-mongers and do not understand progress. If you are an African American you *might* be ok, it helps if you are hurt or imperfect in some other way, if you are a minority then you should be protected and saved, etc etc.The story as a whole makes little sense and it is remains incoherent with empty dialogues and mediocre acting. Why bombs, why the war, it is not explained and when those questions are asked they reply is some sort of a joke, such as ""they are here for our jobs"". Also not explained why would someone remove his prosthetic arm before going to the pool but not his leg. Whatever.The only redeemable quality for this movie is the production value and the almost next-gen gaming-like scenario and photography. I guess if you can ignore everything else, and just look at the imagery you might enjoy it. I personally needed a little more, or actually quite a lot more.This is another polarizing creation. I fell on the ""don't like it"" side, two thumbs down for me. Looks like writers were on strike but CGI was on sale. Exact score: 44 / 100."
"The Creator","masonsaul","28 September 2023",810,"The Creator is an all too rare piece of original epic sci-fi that's built on very familiar foundations and uses them to create something that's as visually exciting as it is emotionally investing, completely unafraid to show American military might for the soulless monster it is.John David Washington plays his reluctant father figure in terrific fashion, closed off at first but those barriers are all successfully worn down by the end. In her screen debut Madeleine Yuna Voyles is amazing, adorable and undoubtedly the main reason any of this works on an emotional level.Supporting them is Ken Watanabe being as effortlessly stoic as always and Allison Janney as an antagonist with a solid amount of depth all thanks to just one scene which efficiently explains her viewpoint in a believable fashion but she's also just plain ruthless in her relentless pursuit.Gareth Edwards once again proves he doesn't need established franchises to create epic imagery or fascinating worlds on a blockbuster scale. Between the stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser & Oren Soffer and the ridiculously impressive CG it outdoes the majority of the competition on a fraction of the cost.Uncharacteristically for Gareth Edwards there's a fair few needle drops early on, the choices can be obvious but always effective and the music by Hans Zimmer is solid. It's mostly just fine up until the third act where it really comes to life and avoids feeling wasted."
"The Creator","CANpatbuck3664","20 October 2023",710,"Starting my review of the creator with some comments on the acting, I'm surprised at how meteoric John David Washington's rise to the top has been. He's a good actor for sure but he's not just ascending the staircase, he's jumping a few steps at a time. He's anchoring the Creator as our protagonist Joshua. I think he's good in the movie, he's brooding for what feels like most of the run time but when he's given a chance to either be funny in short bursts or vulnerable near the end, he gets the job done. Madeleine Yuna Voyles is fine as Alphie, she accomplishes what's required in any given scene and by the end of the movie, she does what she can in regards to selling the bond her character has with Joshua. It's hard to deliver a noteworthy performance as a child actor/actress and she's better than passable. I keep waiting for the Gemma Chan's breakout role but this is one of her better performances as Maya. She has chemistry with Washington but she's given little to do on her own. She's appropriately cast and she sticks the landing in her part. My two favourite performances were from the veteran members of the supporting cast in Ken Watanabe and Allison Janney as Harun and Colonel Howell respectively. Janney pushes the envelope just far enough without descending into being a cartoon character, her character's palpable hatred for the Simulants creates tension and the amount of disdain she conveys through just a look is impressive. Watanabe brings strength to Harun when he needs to but there's also a lot of warmth when his character is bonding with Alphie.Despite some solid work from the cast overall, I'd bet what's probably going to draw your attention in the marketing material for The Creator is the design of this dystopian world and how the war between humans and A. I. dazzles on the big screen. Gareth Edwards and his team weren't working with pennies but this is as impressive of a display for a science fiction movie that I've seen in quite a while. The cinematography is fantastic, the character design of the robots evoked Neil Blomkamp's work for me in the best way without ripping it off and the action set pieces are memorable enough to hold your interest. The movie is just as fantastical (or grounded depending on your opinion on the future of artificial intelligence) as any other sci-fi epic, but there's a beautiful mix of real imagination that keeps the movie grounded just enough that you can still take it seriously. I found it disarming that it was so excellently realized and even if you aren't enthralled by the story, The Creator is still a delight from a visual perspective.I would describe The Creator as story driven as opposed to character driven but we spend enough time with Joshua, Alphie and their friends and enemies to get to know them. I liked the work done on the characters but I wasn't emotionally invested in whether Josh and Maya were going to reunite or if Alphie would make it away safely. I don't want to point the finger at the scriptwriters or the creative team, I was left wondering how much of this movie had been cut out and left on the cutting room floor. Scenes normally required to get us to invest in some of these relationships (e.g. Josh & Alfie, Josh & Shipley or Colonel Howell & McBride) felt like they were missing to me. I don't want to complain about the run time because The Creator isn't a short movie but I was left wondering if they cleaved off a little more than they should have.My most prominent problem with The Creator was how easy to guess the overall arc of the plot was. I didn't discern what it was going to do minute by minute but you can get where the story will start, advance to and finish largely from the trailer. There are some surprises here and there but if you zoom out and observe the macro progression of the plot, this ground has been covered before. Cliche seems a little harsh of a description but The Creator still lacks something bold in where it decides to venture and I was a little disappointed by that.The Creator really falls between a 7-8 for me but this is one of the rare situations where I'm going to round down. The film is still a spectacle and if you can get over that the plot is a little recycled in certain respects, there's a lot here to enjoy. Gareth Edwards and his team deserve kudos for making The Creator a worthy theatre experience. But I still wasn't blown-away by this movie and I wanted it to really kick into the next gear to get past the 8/10 mark. The Creator is a solid science fiction adventure that is worth checking out on the biggest screen you can but outside of it's CGI and visual sensibilities, I don't think it will have the staying power to make the huge impact it's clearly swinging for."

The movie's message seemed to be America: bad; military: bad; Asia: good. And there didn't seem to be any compelling reason to root for the robots other than the fact that the kid was cute and the other AI were poor villagers. It seems to me that in order for a movie to be good, the message should be complex and universally compelling. I didn't get what the message was, other than what I previously stated. Literally every bad guy was white and American. It's either very biased or very patronizing. On the other hand, I did think the actors did a good job, and the cinematography was outstanding."
"The Creator","DanTheMan2150AD","28 September 2023",710,"7 years on from his last big screen venture with the phenomenal Rogue One, The Creator isn't quite the comeback I had hoped for director Gareth Edwards. Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid ""simulants"", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic."

Get this... it's based on ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No really, they FINALLY remade/rebooted/did a sequel to NOT A DAMN THING!! OMGOMG, I've waited my whole life for originality! TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!""Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be ""huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot. Some of these images are worthy of the pages of Simon Stålenhag.Here's hoping Edwards someday adapts some of his tales."

The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects. AND filmmakers everywhere should learn how a budget should be used."
"The Creator","prberg2","30 September 2023",510,"Oh, I really wanted to like this movie. Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important ""weapon/creation""? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way."
"The Creator","BA_Harrison","27 September 2023",510,"The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb."
"The Creator","weraqs","25 November 2023",710,"Walking into the theater, my expectations were a mix of excitement and curiosity, especially given the film's intriguing take on AI.From the get-go, ""The Creator"" impressed me with its use of the $80 million budget. The cinematography was nothing short of remarkable, reminding me of the visual flair seen in ""Blade Runner"" ""Elysium"", ""I, Robot"" and ""A. I."" The world-building was immersive, creating a believable and lived-in environment that drew me in.The performances, particularly the dynamic between Joshua and Alfie, were the highlights of the film for me. Their interactions brought depth to the story, and I found myself genuinely invested in their journey. However, as the plot progressed, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment.The story, which began with promise, started to unravel. The pacing felt rushed, and the plot became increasingly predictable. I noticed glaring plot holes that were hard to overlook, and the narrative lacked the depth I had hoped for. The ambitious theme of AI's humanity, which initially seemed thought-provoking, was undermined by the film's inability to maintain coherence.While I appreciated the technical brilliance of the film, including the special effects and sound design, the script was a letdown. It was as if the movie wanted to say something profound about AI and humanity but ended up glossing over these complex themes, opting instead for a more superficial treatment.The characters, aside from Joshua, felt one-dimensional. I struggled to connect with them emotionally, this emotional disconnect was particularly evident in the portrayal of the AI characters, including Alfie, who, despite being central to the story, lacked the depth to make their plight resonate with me.While ""The Creator"" started off with great potential, it ultimately left me feeling underwhelmed. The film excelled in its visual storytelling but fell short in its narrative execution. It was a visually captivating experience, but the lack of emotional depth and narrative coherence made it a disappointing outing for me. I walked out of the theater feeling that the movie, despite its grand aspirations, missed the mark in delivering a fully engaging and thought-provoking sci-fi experience. It could have been a masterpiece, but a missed opportunity at best."
"The Creator","FeastMode","28 September 2023",410,"Sigh. As a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was looking forward to this new original stand-alone sci-fi movie. And I left fully disappointed. It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie. It could not get me engaged or invested, which is not a difficult task for someone who loves movie as much as I do.(1 viewing, early access screening UltraScreen 9/27/2023)"
"The Creator","kgprophet","29 September 2023",510,"Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick ""The Gray Man"". ""Creator"" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in ""The Manchurian"". Or the chosen kid in ""The Last Airbender"". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in ""Willow"". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In ""Creator"", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of ""Chappie"" with a robot police force. It could also resemble ""Elysium"", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, ""Apocalypse Now""-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish ""assassin turned compassionate"" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go ""Huh?"" ""What?"". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping on the ""A. I."" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words ""Artificial Intelligence"" and ""A. I."" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making ""Rogue One: A Star Wars story"". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10."
"The Creator","Jim_Screechy","17 November 2023",510,"I watched this from start to finish without being drawn into the story at any point.I think John Washington is miscast here, I had the same exact experience when i watched Tenet... found myself very disconnected as I he didn't seem to make a proper connection with the role he was portraying.That is not to say the film isn't without issues. They have been fairly well documented by other reviewers so I'll not labour the points here.My main issue is with the lack of emotional involvment with the characters. The film measures zero on the emtional richter scale, but more, the screenplay just doesn't manage to get you excited or involved with anything that is unfolding. Additionally, the characters seem to have little connection to each other. In fact it is only at the end of the movie that Joshua and Alphie seem to have any tangible emotional cohesion.Contrast this with The Golden Child 1986 where Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell and the connection he makes to The Golden Child played by J. L. Reate. Here you can see what a great connection is established on screen and the massive difference in outcome it produces. Both films have two similar sets of pairings in almost identical scenarios with a stark contrast in outcome.Anyway, for me the film was a big dissapointment, I can't say John David Washington was the cause of this since the Movie has many other problematic aspects, but the ones I've mentioned were particularly significant for me.5/10 sadly."
"The Creator","davemanson","11 October 2023",410,"With stunning visuals reminiscent of Blade Runner and the more recent Rouge One this movie is stunning to look at. Unfortunately the script falls far short of living up to its inspired cinematography. It's full of plot holes and cringe worthy moments from it's extremely one dimensional villains. The plot twist are telegraphed from miles away and there are no real surprises to be had. Everything plays out exactly like you would expect it to. Which is a shame. The look and mood of this film is almost enough to save it. But in the end it falls flat and its potential is wasted. See it for the visuals. Forget it for its script."
"The Creator","kevin_robbins","30 September 2023",610,"My wife and I caught The Creator (2023) in theaters last night. The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once."
"The Creator","Lomax343","28 September 2023",610,"Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity."
"The Creator","alex_with_a_P","1 October 2023",410,"AI is such a rich topic, it can be explored from any kind of angles but this movie decided to use it only as a prop. The AI people are just stand-ins for oppressed people X. None of the AI people are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!), which is one of many advantages machines would have over humans. The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and in a better way.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Awkward change of tones, a weird plot structure with constant flashbacks, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas at play. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the 135min runtime, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to another.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country where the story takes place doesn't have military or a defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers will only be used for a door. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. The last action set piece in particular is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices. Next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. Mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, those have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their task of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing interesting. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. And I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only aesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame."
"The Creator","ethanbresnett","29 September 2023",710,"The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill.It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless.The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film.There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid.Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though."

Absolutely stunning work from director Gareth Edwards and cinematographer Oren Soffer. Shot on a Sony FX3 and on location. Impressive. From color grades, shots and VFX...all top notch. A visual spectacle.Although Gareth Edwards pulls through visually, he fails miserably on the storyline. The amount of times my party sat there and looked at each other saying ""wait, what? Why?"" was too much to count. Things didnt add up and begs the audience to question many things. As if Edwards was just trying to get to an ending rather than build the story. Creating that tension or closeness between ai and humans was lacking.John Washington's mono tone, emotionless acting contributed to that disconnect. The exact ""read off the script"" acting we saw in Tenet. How he got this role is mind blowing and nepotism at its finest. His performance was only saved by child actor Madeleine Voyles, who was great. Few other questionable casting decisions, you'll see if you choose to not wait for the stream (the soccer mom playing a ruthless captain)All in all, this film was entertaining at the very least. Could have been awesome as i love how rogue one was done and im not a star wars fanatic.Worth the ticket? Eh yea not bad but definitely not a rewatch. Oh and ill never watch anything with John Washington again lol."
"The Creator","RussHog","1 January 2024",810,"My friend told me if I saw this in theaters some of the gaping plot holes would stand out more - but as it is I saw it at home and frankly I could care less if there were some plot holes this is a very good film with incredible world building.It tells the story of human v AI and our hero is a former soldier who is sent to track down the AI's ultimate weapon. Turns out the weapon is a child AI - who may or may not have the secret to his seemingly dead wife's location - and now our hero betrays his people to keep the AI safe and try to find his wife.His journey with the AI takes him deep into the heart of this world, and he eventually grows to care for the AI and rebels against his own people. It may sound cliche, but these kinds of stories need to be told again and again.By no stretch of the imagination is this corny like Avatar, this was a very good by the numbers sci-fi movie. Well acted, great special effects, good action scenes, and a big heart with a cool final showdown.Def recommended, too bad I didn't watch this in theaters."
"The Creator","Darksidecrew","28 September 2023",NA,"This new sci-fi film from Gareth Edwards (Rogue One) was made for $80 million but looks like $350 million on screen. It's a global epic on a massive scale. This is how I like films to look, I think it was probably shot on digital but they've made it look like it was shot on film. It does have shades of Terminator, Blade Runner and even Terrence Malick but it also brings some new dimensions to some classic themes. Not only the craftsmanship but the acting is also top notch in this fully immersive tale. It moves very quickly which will help you get past sone story logistics that might crumble on closer examination. A superb effort that leaves the glossy soulless and often brainless blockbusters of recent decades in the dust. A quality film that I recommend supporting in the theaters."

"The Creator","nscoby93","29 September 2023",310,"That is literally all that comes to mind a disappointment. Going in, I genuinely wanted to like this movie. I mean the director of Rogue One doing a standalone new title sci-fi film. What could go wrong? Well, apparently, everything.Let me get through the positives because that's a short list. Good acting, a great concept, and an interesting world... um, that's it.So what's bad about this film? Well, literally everything else. The story is a mess and told equally as messy. The film is convulted and tries so hard to appear deep, intelligent, and emotional, yet it's all surface and is very plain to see how empty it truly is. Unfortunately, Hans Zimmers score does nothing here as the music just didn't stand out, so I was surprised to see that he composed the music.But I think what bothered me the most about this film is that it felt like a more annoying version of Avatar. Gareth Edward's, in my opinion, like James Cameron, shows absolutely no discretion on whom the audience should side with. It all comes off as manipulation and extremely biased. So humans bad, aliens good, turns into America/Western Culture bad, and New Asia/Eastern Culture good.There is no character on the side of the Americans aside from John David Washington's character who is ""good"" or likeable but on the side of the robots they are all victims and the people of New Asia are victims of the oppressive and evil Americans. Who are basically painted as this worlds version of the Empire. They even have a deadly space station. While the robots are the Rebel Alliance doing what they can to fight this evil.So obviously as a viewer and decent human being I won't side with the Americans but the film does nothing to prove to me these robots are the victims that Gareth Edward's so desperately wants me to believe. In fact, there's a sequence that proves to me the opposite that some of these robots will kill their own people to protect this child who is essentially a Christ like figure to the robots. There is absolutely no unbiased look at both sides in this Vietnam like conflict.Then, at the end of everything, the explanation as to the reason for this war is absolutely moronic, I'd say what it is, but that's touching on spoiler territory.The movie explains nothing in the way of what this AI is or how it became ""sentient,"" etc. Also, if these robots are so peaceful and innocent, then why not make an attempt at peace? But that wouldn't happen because America is evil and dead set on destroying all AI consciousness, so any peacetalks would undoubtedly fail. Edward's here expects the audience to take everything at face value and not question anything. Which is exactly what the liberal mind expects from you, so I shouldn't be surprised. Now, I wouldn't say Gareth Edward's is a liberal as I don't know the man, but he's playing with liberal ideologies.Then, the movie tries to be a social commentary on war, which fails miserable because it conflicts with the notion of the robots being all innocent victims. Essentially, the message being all war is unjust, and the ones who suffer the most are the innocent who get caught in the crossfire.So if this film truly wanted to show that war is the real enemy, then don't paint one side as innocent victims and paint the other as cruel, oppressive aggressors. Instead, put in some effort and show that both sides aren't innocent that both sides have done evil to one another.Finally the film is no where near as beautiful as trailers made it out to look, but I'm going to be honest here and say that's most likely due to the fact we watched this film in a crap auditorium. So, hopefully, upon a second viewing, which I do plan on having, it'll be with a better projector and screen. But also so much of this movie took place at night, which I could not understand why. Perhaps so they didn't have to show so much? I have no clue. The action, I guess, looked good, but I just didn't care for what was happening in it.Anyway, I will close things here and say I'm sure a great many people would disagree with me, but that's fine. These are the issues I had with this film, and they are simply my opinions. If you liked this movie, then great. I'm happy for you, but I am just genuinely disappointed. Though, after seeing the film, I can understand why it has mixed scores.IMDb: 3/10

"The Creator","Xstal","2 October 2023",510,"As the opening kicks off there's expectations, that the film that's being screened has firm foundations, and to be fair it's a good start, rise of machines is at its heart, as well as difference, evolving change and diverse nations. There are hints of lots of things you've seen before, wars of stars and running blades are all top drawer, but once the façade has been cracked, you'll feel as though you're being hacked, as the pace turns to a saunter, and starts to bore. At the end you'll find the steam has all escaped, that the barrel comes so close to being scraped, an apocalypse of ages, just another war that rages, you're disappointed as you leave, and your coats draped."
"The Creator","benjaminskylerhill","28 September 2023",910,"Gareth Edwards proves himself to be an astoundingly brilliant director with The Creator, as he crafts a visual and auditory world rich with layers of detail, and characters that we quickly understand and naturally grow over the course of the story.He made an $80 million movie that looks like it cost at least twice that. This cost less than half of what Thor: Love and Thunder cost. Let that sink in.Edwards shows he's a better director than writer, as the film is far from original, borrowing concepts and themes from plenty of old classic sci-fi stories. And it's also burdened with some clunky dialogue and rushed, convenient crucial plot points.Yeah, it's imperfect. But it's made with a confidence and care that goes beyond the degree of admirable. It's an earnest expression of love, redemption, sacrifice, and forgiveness put out by a filmmaker who really cares for the characters whose story he's telling.It's a work of art that, even with its flaws, deserves to be seen."
"The Creator","FixedYourEnding","17 November 2023",410,"This is going to be an unpopular review, I know. Maybe I was in the wrong mood coming into this movie, but I turned it off after 25 minutes, couldn't stand it anymore. The whole premise of American white males are constant war-mongers and do not understand progress. If you are an African American you *might* be ok, it helps if you are hurt or imperfect in some other way, if you are a minority then you should be protected and saved, etc etc.The story as a whole makes little sense and it is remains incoherent with empty dialogues and mediocre acting. Why bombs, why the war, it is not explained and when those questions are asked they reply is some sort of a joke, such as ""they are here for our jobs"". Also not explained why would someone remove his prosthetic arm before going to the pool but not his leg. Whatever.The only redeemable quality for this movie is the production value and the almost next-gen gaming-like scenario and photography. I guess if you can ignore everything else, and just look at the imagery you might enjoy it. I personally needed a little more, or actually quite a lot more.This is another polarizing creation. I fell on the ""don't like it"" side, two thumbs down for me. Looks like writers were on strike but CGI was on sale. Exact score: 44 / 100."
"The Creator","masonsaul","28 September 2023",810,"The Creator is an all too rare piece of original epic sci-fi that's built on very familiar foundations and uses them to create something that's as visually exciting as it is emotionally investing, completely unafraid to show American military might for the soulless monster it is.John David Washington plays his reluctant father figure in terrific fashion, closed off at first but those barriers are all successfully worn down by the end. In her screen debut Madeleine Yuna Voyles is amazing, adorable and undoubtedly the main reason any of this works on an emotional level.Supporting them is Ken Watanabe being as effortlessly stoic as always and Allison Janney as an antagonist with a solid amount of depth all thanks to just one scene which efficiently explains her viewpoint in a believable fashion but she's also just plain ruthless in her relentless pursuit.Gareth Edwards once again proves he doesn't need established franchises to create epic imagery or fascinating worlds on a blockbuster scale. Between the stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser & Oren Soffer and the ridiculously impressive CG it outdoes the majority of the competition on a fraction of the cost.Uncharacteristically for Gareth Edwards there's a fair few needle drops early on, the choices can be obvious but always effective and the music by Hans Zimmer is solid. It's mostly just fine up until the third act where it really comes to life and avoids feeling wasted."
"The Creator","CANpatbuck3664","20 October 2023",710,"Starting my review of the creator with some comments on the acting, I'm surprised at how meteoric John David Washington's rise to the top has been. He's a good actor for sure but he's not just ascending the staircase, he's jumping a few steps at a time. He's anchoring the Creator as our protagonist Joshua. I think he's good in the movie, he's brooding for what feels like most of the run time but when he's given a chance to either be funny in short bursts or vulnerable near the end, he gets the job done. Madeleine Yuna Voyles is fine as Alphie, she accomplishes what's required in any given scene and by the end of the movie, she does what she can in regards to selling the bond her character has with Joshua. It's hard to deliver a noteworthy performance as a child actor/actress and she's better than passable. I keep waiting for the Gemma Chan's breakout role but this is one of her better performances as Maya. She has chemistry with Washington but she's given little to do on her own. She's appropriately cast and she sticks the landing in her part. My two favourite performances were from the veteran members of the supporting cast in Ken Watanabe and Allison Janney as Harun and Colonel Howell respectively. Janney pushes the envelope just far enough without descending into being a cartoon character, her character's palpable hatred for the Simulants creates tension and the amount of disdain she conveys through just a look is impressive. Watanabe brings strength to Harun when he needs to but there's also a lot of warmth when his character is bonding with Alphie.Despite some solid work from the cast overall, I'd bet what's probably going to draw your attention in the marketing material for The Creator is the design of this dystopian world and how the war between humans and A. I. dazzles on the big screen. Gareth Edwards and his team weren't working with pennies but this is as impressive of a display for a science fiction movie that I've seen in quite a while. The cinematography is fantastic, the character design of the robots evoked Neil Blomkamp's work for me in the best way without ripping it off and the action set pieces are memorable enough to hold your interest. The movie is just as fantastical (or grounded depending on your opinion on the future of artificial intelligence) as any other sci-fi epic, but there's a beautiful mix of real imagination that keeps the movie grounded just enough that you can still take it seriously. I found it disarming that it was so excellently realized and even if you aren't enthralled by the story, The Creator is still a delight from a visual perspective.I would describe The Creator as story driven as opposed to character driven but we spend enough time with Joshua, Alphie and their friends and enemies to get to know them. I liked the work done on the characters but I wasn't emotionally invested in whether Josh and Maya were going to reunite or if Alphie would make it away safely. I don't want to point the finger at the scriptwriters or the creative team, I was left wondering how much of this movie had been cut out and left on the cutting room floor. Scenes normally required to get us to invest in some of these relationships (e.g. Josh & Alfie, Josh & Shipley or Colonel Howell & McBride) felt like they were missing to me. I don't want to complain about the run time because The Creator isn't a short movie but I was left wondering if they cleaved off a little more than they should have.My most prominent problem with The Creator was how easy to guess the overall arc of the plot was. I didn't discern what it was going to do minute by minute but you can get where the story will start, advance to and finish largely from the trailer. There are some surprises here and there but if you zoom out and observe the macro progression of the plot, this ground has been covered before. Cliche seems a little harsh of a description but The Creator still lacks something bold in where it decides to venture and I was a little disappointed by that.The Creator really falls between a 7-8 for me but this is one of the rare situations where I'm going to round down. The film is still a spectacle and if you can get over that the plot is a little recycled in certain respects, there's a lot here to enjoy. Gareth Edwards and his team deserve kudos for making The Creator a worthy theatre experience. But I still wasn't blown-away by this movie and I wanted it to really kick into the next gear to get past the 8/10 mark. The Creator is a solid science fiction adventure that is worth checking out on the biggest screen you can but outside of it's CGI and visual sensibilities, I don't think it will have the staying power to make the huge impact it's clearly swinging for."
"The Creator","Imshortok06","30 September 2023",510,"You know a movie is bad when you take your Asian immigrant dad to go watch it with you and the first thing he says after watching it is ""Okay, which communist wrote this?!"" The movie's message seemed to be America: bad; military: bad; Asia: good. And there didn't seem to be any compelling reason to root for the robots other than the fact that the kid was cute and the other AI were poor villagers. It seems to me that in order for a movie to be good, the message should be complex and universally compelling. I didn't get what the message was, other than what I previously stated. Literally every bad guy was white and American. It's either very biased or very patronizing. On the other hand, I did think the actors did a good job, and the cinematography was outstanding."
"The Creator","DanTheMan2150AD","28 September 2023",710,"7 years on from his last big screen venture with the phenomenal Rogue One, The Creator isn't quite the comeback I had hoped for director Gareth Edwards. Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid ""simulants"", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic."
"The Creator","TheVictoriousV","1 October 2023",510,"When the trailer for The Creator came out, I basically became a Facebook Disney fangirl but, like, the opposite.I was all ""OMGOMG it's a big Hollywood sci-fi movie but, like, it's made by a director with a voice and... Get this... it's based on ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No really, they FINALLY remade/rebooted/did a sequel to NOT A DAMN THING!! OMGOMG, I've waited my whole life for originality! TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!""Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be ""huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot. Some of these images are worthy of the pages of Simon Stålenhag.Here's hoping Edwards someday adapts some of his tales."
"The Creator","poseyfan","29 September 2023",710,"This is a lesson to the movie industry on how to use a budget. 80 million dollars was used splendidly. The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects. AND filmmakers everywhere should learn how a budget should be used."
"The Creator","prberg2","30 September 2023",510,"Oh, I really wanted to like this movie. Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important ""weapon/creation""? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way."
"The Creator","BA_Harrison","27 September 2023",510,"The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb."
"The Creator","weraqs","25 November 2023",710,"Walking into the theater, my expectations were a mix of excitement and curiosity, especially given the film's intriguing take on AI.From the get-go, ""The Creator"" impressed me with its use of the $80 million budget. The cinematography was nothing short of remarkable, reminding me of the visual flair seen in ""Blade Runner"" ""Elysium"", ""I, Robot"" and ""A. I."" The world-building was immersive, creating a believable and lived-in environment that drew me in.The performances, particularly the dynamic between Joshua and Alfie, were the highlights of the film for me. Their interactions brought depth to the story, and I found myself genuinely invested in their journey. However, as the plot progressed, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment.The story, which began with promise, started to unravel. The pacing felt rushed, and the plot became increasingly predictable. I noticed glaring plot holes that were hard to overlook, and the narrative lacked the depth I had hoped for. The ambitious theme of AI's humanity, which initially seemed thought-provoking, was undermined by the film's inability to maintain coherence.While I appreciated the technical brilliance of the film, including the special effects and sound design, the script was a letdown. It was as if the movie wanted to say something profound about AI and humanity but ended up glossing over these complex themes, opting instead for a more superficial treatment.The characters, aside from Joshua, felt one-dimensional. I struggled to connect with them emotionally, this emotional disconnect was particularly evident in the portrayal of the AI characters, including Alfie, who, despite being central to the story, lacked the depth to make their plight resonate with me.While ""The Creator"" started off with great potential, it ultimately left me feeling underwhelmed. The film excelled in its visual storytelling but fell short in its narrative execution. It was a visually captivating experience, but the lack of emotional depth and narrative coherence made it a disappointing outing for me. I walked out of the theater feeling that the movie, despite its grand aspirations, missed the mark in delivering a fully engaging and thought-provoking sci-fi experience. It could have been a masterpiece, but a missed opportunity at best."
"The Creator","FeastMode","28 September 2023",410,"Sigh. As a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was looking forward to this new original stand-alone sci-fi movie. And I left fully disappointed. It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie. It could not get me engaged or invested, which is not a difficult task for someone who loves movie as much as I do.(1 viewing, early access screening UltraScreen 9/27/2023)"
"The Creator","kgprophet","29 September 2023",510,"Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick ""The Gray Man"". ""Creator"" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in ""The Manchurian"". Or the chosen kid in ""The Last Airbender"". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in ""Willow"". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In ""Creator"", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of ""Chappie"" with a robot police force. It could also resemble ""Elysium"", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, ""Apocalypse Now""-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish ""assassin turned compassionate"" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go ""Huh?"" ""What?"". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping on the ""A. I."" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words ""Artificial Intelligence"" and ""A. I."" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making ""Rogue One: A Star Wars story"". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10."
"The Creator","Jim_Screechy","17 November 2023",510,"I watched this from start to finish without being drawn into the story at any point.I think John Washington is miscast here, I had the same exact experience when i watched Tenet... found myself very disconnected as I he didn't seem to make a proper connection with the role he was portraying.That is not to say the film isn't without issues. They have been fairly well documented by other reviewers so I'll not labour the points here.My main issue is with the lack of emotional involvment with the characters. The film measures zero on the emtional richter scale, but more, the screenplay just doesn't manage to get you excited or involved with anything that is unfolding. Additionally, the characters seem to have little connection to each other. In fact it is only at the end of the movie that Joshua and Alphie seem to have any tangible emotional cohesion.Contrast this with The Golden Child 1986 where Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell and the connection he makes to The Golden Child played by J. L. Reate. Here you can see what a great connection is established on screen and the massive difference in outcome it produces. Both films have two similar sets of pairings in almost identical scenarios with a stark contrast in outcome.Anyway, for me the film was a big dissapointment, I can't say John David Washington was the cause of this since the Movie has many other problematic aspects, but the ones I've mentioned were particularly significant for me.5/10 sadly."
"The Creator","davemanson","11 October 2023",410,"With stunning visuals reminiscent of Blade Runner and the more recent Rouge One this movie is stunning to look at. Unfortunately the script falls far short of living up to its inspired cinematography. It's full of plot holes and cringe worthy moments from it's extremely one dimensional villains. The plot twist are telegraphed from miles away and there are no real surprises to be had. Everything plays out exactly like you would expect it to. Which is a shame. The look and mood of this film is almost enough to save it. But in the end it falls flat and its potential is wasted. See it for the visuals. Forget it for its script."
"The Creator","kevin_robbins","30 September 2023",610,"My wife and I caught The Creator (2023) in theaters last night. The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once."
"The Creator","Lomax343","28 September 2023",610,"Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity."
"The Creator","alex_with_a_P","1 October 2023",410,"AI is such a rich topic, it can be explored from any kind of angles but this movie decided to use it only as a prop. The AI people are just stand-ins for oppressed people X. None of the AI people are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!), which is one of many advantages machines would have over humans. The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and in a better way.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Awkward change of tones, a weird plot structure with constant flashbacks, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas at play. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the 135min runtime, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to another.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country where the story takes place doesn't have military or a defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers will only be used for a door. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. The last action set piece in particular is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices. Next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. Mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, those have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their task of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing interesting. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. And I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only aesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame."
"The Creator","ethanbresnett","29 September 2023",710,"The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill.It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless.The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film.There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid.Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though."

Absolutely stunning work from director Gareth Edwards and cinematographer Oren Soffer. Shot on a Sony FX3 and on location. Impressive. From color grades, shots and VFX...all top notch. A visual spectacle.Although Gareth Edwards pulls through visually, he fails miserably on the storyline. The amount of times my party sat there and looked at each other saying ""wait, what? Why?"" was too much to count. Things didnt add up and begs the audience to question many things. As if Edwards was just trying to get to an ending rather than build the story. Creating that tension or closeness between ai and humans was lacking.John Washington's mono tone, emotionless acting contributed to that disconnect. The exact ""read off the script"" acting we saw in Tenet. How he got this role is mind blowing and nepotism at its finest. His performance was only saved by child actor Madeleine Voyles, who was great. Few other questionable casting decisions, you'll see if you choose to not wait for the stream (the soccer mom playing a ruthless captain)All in all, this film was entertaining at the very least. Could have been awesome as i love how rogue one was done and im not a star wars fanatic.Worth the ticket? Eh yea not bad but definitely not a rewatch. Oh and ill never watch anything with John Washington again lol."
"The Creator","RussHog","1 January 2024",810,"My friend told me if I saw this in theaters some of the gaping plot holes would stand out more - but as it is I saw it at home and frankly I could care less if there were some plot holes this is a very good film with incredible world building.It tells the story of human v AI and our hero is a former soldier who is sent to track down the AI's ultimate weapon. Turns out the weapon is a child AI - who may or may not have the secret to his seemingly dead wife's location - and now our hero betrays his people to keep the AI safe and try to find his wife.His journey with the AI takes him deep into the heart of this world, and he eventually grows to care for the AI and rebels against his own people. It may sound cliche, but these kinds of stories need to be told again and again.By no stretch of the imagination is this corny like Avatar, this was a very good by the numbers sci-fi movie. Well acted, great special effects, good action scenes, and a big heart with a cool final showdown.Def recommended, too bad I didn't watch this in theaters."
"The Creator","Darksidecrew","28 September 2023",NA,"This new sci-fi film from Gareth Edwards (Rogue One) was made for $80 million but looks like $350 million on screen. It's a global epic on a massive scale. This is how I like films to look, I think it was probably shot on digital but they've made it look like it was shot on film. It does have shades of Terminator, Blade Runner and even Terrence Malick but it also brings some new dimensions to some classic themes. Not only the craftsmanship but the acting is also top notch in this fully immersive tale. It moves very quickly which will help you get past sone story logistics that might crumble on closer examination. A superb effort that leaves the glossy soulless and often brainless blockbusters of recent decades in the dust. A quality film that I recommend supporting in the theaters."
"The Creator","Padreviews","8 November 2023",410,"There are classic sci fi movies like Bladerunner then there's this - don't go expecting Bladerunner .It's not all bad , it just wasn't good .If you add the cgi skill of Neill Blomkampt films like District 9 & Elysium - but think more of the latter than the former you're getting close - all flash but script let it downI'm some ways it had similarities with Starship troopers & Terminator but here the lines were blurred as to who were the good guys & who were the baddies - if anything it was like Avatar where the aliens or AI replicants were actually the underdogs - not unlike what's happening in the Middle East right now or what happened to the native Americans when the Europeans colonised the westSo emotionally it should have done well but you didn't feel connected , the acting of the little child was a standout & you couldn't help but root for that characterAt the end of the day it wasn't a film you wanting to tell everyone to go and see it , it was quite the opposite & there's probably not enough material there for a sequel but perhaps a prequel might have legs although that might actually seem like a pun if you see the movieCGI 1 script 0Pad. A average 4/10."
"The Creator","nscoby93","29 September 2023",310,"That is literally all that comes to mind a disappointment. Going in, I genuinely wanted to like this movie. I mean the director of Rogue One doing a standalone new title sci-fi film. What could go wrong? Well, apparently, everything.Let me get through the positives because that's a short list. Good acting, a great concept, and an interesting world... um, that's it.So what's bad about this film? Well, literally everything else. The story is a mess and told equally as messy. The film is convulted and tries so hard to appear deep, intelligent, and emotional, yet it's all surface and is very plain to see how empty it truly is. Unfortunately, Hans Zimmers score does nothing here as the music just didn't stand out, so I was surprised to see that he composed the music.But I think what bothered me the most about this film is that it felt like a more annoying version of Avatar. Gareth Edward's, in my opinion, like James Cameron, shows absolutely no discretion on whom the audience should side with. It all comes off as manipulation and extremely biased. So humans bad, aliens good, turns into America/Western Culture bad, and New Asia/Eastern Culture good.There is no character on the side of the Americans aside from John David Washington's character who is ""good"" or likeable but on the side of the robots they are all victims and the people of New Asia are victims of the oppressive and evil Americans. Who are basically painted as this worlds version of the Empire. They even have a deadly space station. While the robots are the Rebel Alliance doing what they can to fight this evil.So obviously as a viewer and decent human being I won't side with the Americans but the film does nothing to prove to me these robots are the victims that Gareth Edward's so desperately wants me to believe. In fact, there's a sequence that proves to me the opposite that some of these robots will kill their own people to protect this child who is essentially a Christ like figure to the robots. There is absolutely no unbiased look at both sides in this Vietnam like conflict.Then, at the end of everything, the explanation as to the reason for this war is absolutely moronic, I'd say what it is, but that's touching on spoiler territory.The movie explains nothing in the way of what this AI is or how it became ""sentient,"" etc. Also, if these robots are so peaceful and innocent, then why not make an attempt at peace? But that wouldn't happen because America is evil and dead set on destroying all AI consciousness, so any peacetalks would undoubtedly fail. Edward's here expects the audience to take everything at face value and not question anything. Which is exactly what the liberal mind expects from you, so I shouldn't be surprised. Now, I wouldn't say Gareth Edward's is a liberal as I don't know the man, but he's playing with liberal ideologies.Then, the movie tries to be a social commentary on war, which fails miserable because it conflicts with the notion of the robots being all innocent victims. Essentially, the message being all war is unjust, and the ones who suffer the most are the innocent who get caught in the crossfire.So if this film truly wanted to show that war is the real enemy, then don't paint one side as innocent victims and paint the other as cruel, oppressive aggressors. Instead, put in some effort and show that both sides aren't innocent that both sides have done evil to one another.Finally the film is no where near as beautiful as trailers made it out to look, but I'm going to be honest here and say that's most likely due to the fact we watched this film in a crap auditorium. So, hopefully, upon a second viewing, which I do plan on having, it'll be with a better projector and screen. But also so much of this movie took place at night, which I could not understand why. Perhaps so they didn't have to show so much? I have no clue. The action, I guess, looked good, but I just didn't care for what was happening in it.Anyway, I will close things here and say I'm sure a great many people would disagree with me, but that's fine. These are the issues I had with this film, and they are simply my opinions. If you liked this movie, then great. I'm happy for you, but I am just genuinely disappointed. Though, after seeing the film, I can understand why it has mixed scores.IMDb: 3/10
Letterboxd: 2/5Watched in Theaters."
"The Creator","Xstal","2 October 2023",510,"As the opening kicks off there's expectations, that the film that's being screened has firm foundations, and to be fair it's a good start, rise of machines is at its heart, as well as difference, evolving change and diverse nations. There are hints of lots of things you've seen before, wars of stars and running blades are all top drawer, but once the façade has been cracked, you'll feel as though you're being hacked, as the pace turns to a saunter, and starts to bore. At the end you'll find the steam has all escaped, that the barrel comes so close to being scraped, an apocalypse of ages, just another war that rages, you're disappointed as you leave, and your coats draped."
"The Creator","benjaminskylerhill","28 September 2023",910,"Gareth Edwards proves himself to be an astoundingly brilliant director with The Creator, as he crafts a visual and auditory world rich with layers of detail, and characters that we quickly understand and naturally grow over the course of the story.He made an $80 million movie that looks like it cost at least twice that. This cost less than half of what Thor: Love and Thunder cost. Let that sink in.Edwards shows he's a better director than writer, as the film is far from original, borrowing concepts and themes from plenty of old classic sci-fi stories. And it's also burdened with some clunky dialogue and rushed, convenient crucial plot points.Yeah, it's imperfect. But it's made with a confidence and care that goes beyond the degree of admirable. It's an earnest expression of love, redemption, sacrifice, and forgiveness put out by a filmmaker who really cares for the characters whose story he's telling.It's a work of art that, even with its flaws, deserves to be seen."
"The Creator","FixedYourEnding","17 November 2023",410,"This is going to be an unpopular review, I know. Maybe I was in the wrong mood coming into this movie, but I turned it off after 25 minutes, couldn't stand it anymore. The whole premise of American white males are constant war-mongers and do not understand progress. If you are an African American you *might* be ok, it helps if you are hurt or imperfect in some other way, if you are a minority then you should be protected and saved, etc etc.The story as a whole makes little sense and it is remains incoherent with empty dialogues and mediocre acting. Why bombs, why the war, it is not explained and when those questions are asked they reply is some sort of a joke, such as ""they are here for our jobs"". Also not explained why would someone remove his prosthetic arm before going to the pool but not his leg. Whatever.The only redeemable quality for this movie is the production value and the almost next-gen gaming-like scenario and photography. I guess if you can ignore everything else, and just look at the imagery you might enjoy it. I personally needed a little more, or actually quite a lot more.This is another polarizing creation. I fell on the ""don't like it"" side, two thumbs down for me. Looks like writers were on strike but CGI was on sale. Exact score: 44 / 100."
"The Creator","masonsaul","28 September 2023",810,"The Creator is an all too rare piece of original epic sci-fi that's built on very familiar foundations and uses them to create something that's as visually exciting as it is emotionally investing, completely unafraid to show American military might for the soulless monster it is.John David Washington plays his reluctant father figure in terrific fashion, closed off at first but those barriers are all successfully worn down by the end. In her screen debut Madeleine Yuna Voyles is amazing, adorable and undoubtedly the main reason any of this works on an emotional level.Supporting them is Ken Watanabe being as effortlessly stoic as always and Allison Janney as an antagonist with a solid amount of depth all thanks to just one scene which efficiently explains her viewpoint in a believable fashion but she's also just plain ruthless in her relentless pursuit.Gareth Edwards once again proves he doesn't need established franchises to create epic imagery or fascinating worlds on a blockbuster scale. Between the stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser & Oren Soffer and the ridiculously impressive CG it outdoes the majority of the competition on a fraction of the cost.Uncharacteristically for Gareth Edwards there's a fair few needle drops early on, the choices can be obvious but always effective and the music by Hans Zimmer is solid. It's mostly just fine up until the third act where it really comes to life and avoids feeling wasted."
"The Creator","CANpatbuck3664","20 October 2023",710,"Starting my review of the creator with some comments on the acting, I'm surprised at how meteoric John David Washington's rise to the top has been. He's a good actor for sure but he's not just ascending the staircase, he's jumping a few steps at a time. He's anchoring the Creator as our protagonist Joshua. I think he's good in the movie, he's brooding for what feels like most of the run time but when he's given a chance to either be funny in short bursts or vulnerable near the end, he gets the job done. Madeleine Yuna Voyles is fine as Alphie, she accomplishes what's required in any given scene and by the end of the movie, she does what she can in regards to selling the bond her character has with Joshua. It's hard to deliver a noteworthy performance as a child actor/actress and she's better than passable. I keep waiting for the Gemma Chan's breakout role but this is one of her better performances as Maya. She has chemistry with Washington but she's given little to do on her own. She's appropriately cast and she sticks the landing in her part. My two favourite performances were from the veteran members of the supporting cast in Ken Watanabe and Allison Janney as Harun and Colonel Howell respectively. Janney pushes the envelope just far enough without descending into being a cartoon character, her character's palpable hatred for the Simulants creates tension and the amount of disdain she conveys through just a look is impressive. Watanabe brings strength to Harun when he needs to but there's also a lot of warmth when his character is bonding with Alphie.Despite some solid work from the cast overall, I'd bet what's probably going to draw your attention in the marketing material for The Creator is the design of this dystopian world and how the war between humans and A. I. dazzles on the big screen. Gareth Edwards and his team weren't working with pennies but this is as impressive of a display for a science fiction movie that I've seen in quite a while. The cinematography is fantastic, the character design of the robots evoked Neil Blomkamp's work for me in the best way without ripping it off and the action set pieces are memorable enough to hold your interest. The movie is just as fantastical (or grounded depending on your opinion on the future of artificial intelligence) as any other sci-fi epic, but there's a beautiful mix of real imagination that keeps the movie grounded just enough that you can still take it seriously. I found it disarming that it was so excellently realized and even if you aren't enthralled by the story, The Creator is still a delight from a visual perspective.I would describe The Creator as story driven as opposed to character driven but we spend enough time with Joshua, Alphie and their friends and enemies to get to know them. I liked the work done on the characters but I wasn't emotionally invested in whether Josh and Maya were going to reunite or if Alphie would make it away safely. I don't want to point the finger at the scriptwriters or the creative team, I was left wondering how much of this movie had been cut out and left on the cutting room floor. Scenes normally required to get us to invest in some of these relationships (e.g. Josh & Alfie, Josh & Shipley or Colonel Howell & McBride) felt like they were missing to me. I don't want to complain about the run time because The Creator isn't a short movie but I was left wondering if they cleaved off a little more than they should have.My most prominent problem with The Creator was how easy to guess the overall arc of the plot was. I didn't discern what it was going to do minute by minute but you can get where the story will start, advance to and finish largely from the trailer. There are some surprises here and there but if you zoom out and observe the macro progression of the plot, this ground has been covered before. Cliche seems a little harsh of a description but The Creator still lacks something bold in where it decides to venture and I was a little disappointed by that.The Creator really falls between a 7-8 for me but this is one of the rare situations where I'm going to round down. The film is still a spectacle and if you can get over that the plot is a little recycled in certain respects, there's a lot here to enjoy. Gareth Edwards and his team deserve kudos for making The Creator a worthy theatre experience. But I still wasn't blown-away by this movie and I wanted it to really kick into the next gear to get past the 8/10 mark. The Creator is a solid science fiction adventure that is worth checking out on the biggest screen you can but outside of it's CGI and visual sensibilities, I don't think it will have the staying power to make the huge impact it's clearly swinging for."
"The Creator","Imshortok06","30 September 2023",510,"You know a movie is bad when you take your Asian immigrant dad to go watch it with you and the first thing he says after watching it is ""Okay, which communist wrote this?!"" The movie's message seemed to be America: bad; military: bad; Asia: good. And there didn't seem to be any compelling reason to root for the robots other than the fact that the kid was cute and the other AI were poor villagers. It seems to me that in order for a movie to be good, the message should be complex and universally compelling. I didn't get what the message was, other than what I previously stated. Literally every bad guy was white and American. It's either very biased or very patronizing. On the other hand, I did think the actors did a good job, and the cinematography was outstanding."
"The Creator","DanTheMan2150AD","28 September 2023",710,"7 years on from his last big screen venture with the phenomenal Rogue One, The Creator isn't quite the comeback I had hoped for director Gareth Edwards. Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid ""simulants"", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic."
"The Creator","TheVictoriousV","1 October 2023",510,"When the trailer for The Creator came out, I basically became a Facebook Disney fangirl but, like, the opposite.I was all ""OMGOMG it's a big Hollywood sci-fi movie but, like, it's made by a director with a voice and... Get this... it's based on ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No really, they FINALLY remade/rebooted/did a sequel to NOT A DAMN THING!! OMGOMG, I've waited my whole life for originality! TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!""Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be ""huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot. Some of these images are worthy of the pages of Simon Stålenhag.Here's hoping Edwards someday adapts some of his tales."
