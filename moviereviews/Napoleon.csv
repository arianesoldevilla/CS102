"Napoleon","imseeg","23 November 2023",610,"A word of warning for those expecting another Gladiator or non stop action spectacle. It is not. Truly not...The bad: director Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes look slick and impressive (and he does an excellent job again), but he is also known for being quite average at making a drama. And this movie tries (and partly fails) to combine action and drama and somehow ends up being neither one. THAT is one of the reasons I'll only rate it with 6 stars.More bad: this story has a weak ""dramatic"" middle (love story) part, which is kinda tedious. And that brings me to a storyline complaint, namely that this story is all over the place. They cram SO much events and history and different characters from different time periods into this one movie that it kinda confused and numbed me down, instead of thrilling me, as an epic should do.This movie was made for Apple streaming (release date january 2024) in the first place, but they made a shorter (butchered) version for the cinemas in order to be able to compete for the Oscars, which demands that a movie must have run in the cinemas for a couple of weeks. No cinema version, no Oscars.The original Apple streaming version lasted some 2 hours longer. Nobody is gonna sit in the cinema for over 4 hours, hence they cut this movie up and now it feels somewhat rushed, confusing and disjointed at certain moments.Not any good then? Joaquin Phoenix is the one redeeming feature. He nails it.. He makes Napoleon look like a complete joke of a man and I love Joaquin Phoenix' performance, but that unfortunately didnt compensate for the other actors being just about average and with little actor's chemistry between them.I had been warned beforehand by friends that this wasnt the spectacle or epic drama they were hoping for and unfortunately they were right. Certainly not a terrible movie, but one that is just about average.Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb."
"Napoleon","petra_ste","3 December 2023",610,"Ridley Scott directed one of the best movies ever made set during the Napoleonic Wars: unfortunately, that movie is not Napoleon but his cinematic debut, The Duellists, forty years ago.Unsurprisingly, The Duellists had a strong source material (it was based on a novel by Joseph Conrad which it often followed almost verbatim), while Napoleon has an uneven screenplay by David Scarpa.Even past the age of eighty Sir Ridley can still shoot pretty and energetic pictures but his hits and misses depend on the scripts he picks, and he hasn't always shown the best discernment.The elephant in the room is the large amount of historical inaccuracies. Even as a history buff I can forgive many of those: cutting or simplifying events for the sake of narrative, or even some overdramatization like the meeting between Napoleon and Wellington (it never happened) or Napoleon being present at Marie Antoinette's execution (he wasn't); however, stuff like Napoleon charging with his troops at Waterloo is absolute cringe, a kid's (or a lout's) idea of history.Still, the big problems here are characterization and pacing.The movie is a demythologization (some would say emasculation) of Napoleon. If you want to take this route then fair enough, but the character here fails to be consistent. I can buy a Napoleon who is an egomaniac and an overrated tactician (like in Tolstoy's War and Peace). I do not buy one who is an anxious, insecure, uncharismatic cold fish but also a stern tactical genius and an effective leader of men, one who flees from Egypt because Josephine is unfaithful but is also an unflappable military mastermind.Phoenix is a great actor and does what he can but the two sides of the character just don't gel with each other. You can't have parodic moments like Napoleon rolling down the stairs during his coup against the Directory, despondently pouting as he waits for the rain to stop at Waterloo or awkwardly climbing on a box to stand face to face with a pharaoh's mummy (with his diminutive stature becoming a not-too-subtle metaphor of his overall mediocrity)... AND THEN have him magnetically charm the French soldiers into obedience after the Elba. This gawky Napoleon would have been shot to pieces there.The other problem is pacing. A single movie about the whole life of Napoleon is in itself absurd, like making ""a movie about World War 2"". There is material in Napoleon's life for a VERY dense miniseries (which Steven Spielberg is reportedly planning).Napoleon's first wife Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) plays a huge role here but I would argue the movie has either too little or way too much of her. This needed to be either focused mostly on Napoleon's personal life or to drastically reduce the (fairly repetitive after a while) moments where Napoleon is obsessed with his wife.As it is now, it tries to tell - but rushes through - twenty very eventful years of European history and yet devotes more time to Napoleon visiting Josephine after their divorce than to his Russian campaign.It's like making a D-Day movie which keeps cutting back and forth from the Normandy landings to Hitler spending time with Eva Braun. You can have either The Longest Day or Der Untergang, not both.Still, it's not worthless. There are some interesting moments and set-pieces and, while Phoenix is saddled with a contradictory character, Kirby at least is excellent.6/10."
"Napoleon","MissSimonetta","25 November 2023",210,"Ridley Scott's NAPOLEON feels like the highlight reel of a lengthy miniseries. Considering there's a 4-hour cut of this film, that explains it all.NAPOLEON is certainly good spectacle. The battle scenes are breathtaking. Unfortunately, it's also shallow. I know Scott has sneered at viewers criticizing the historical inaccuracies in the film, but I'm more bothered by a total lack of interesting character psychology or even coherent storytelling. Characters pop in and out, leaving little impression in their brief scenes. Relationships between characters are barely fleshed out, including that of Napoleon and Josephine, which dominates the running time. Also, potentially unpopular opinion, I thought Joaquin Phoenix's performance was a one-note bore.Perhaps the 4-hour version is a richer piece of work. As is, NAPOLEON is a let down, especially after Scott's brilliant 2021 period piece THE LAST DUEL, which had all the drama and psychological depth this movie lacked."
"Napoleon","dhunjiwadia","26 November 2023",510,"Ridley Scott's Napoleon is more hysterical than historical. History is like an uninvited guest in this movie. Stunning battle visuals don't make up for gross historical approximations.If you want to watch a masterpiece then see Waterloo, with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. And if you want a historical enumeration then watch the Napoleon series with Christian Clavier, Isabella Rossalini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu.This movie was made for Apple streaming. Then they made a butchered version for cinema to be able to compete for the Oscars. The original Apple streaming version will be at least 2 hours longer. This cut version for cinema is somewhat rushed, disjointed and, as a result, confusing.We never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful and won the admiration of so many. Here it's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in reality, over here he's shown as a childish brute. The focus was more on set pieces and his relationship with Josephine.Joaquin Phoenix can play odd or troubled characters well. Here he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. He's too old for this role (Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined) and made the character seem bizarre than a charismatic leader. Vanessa Kirby as Josephine gets more traction.The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is of a very high order. The battle scenes are filmed well. Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes slick and impressive. But overall it's a below average movie. Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie."
"Napoleon","krzysiektom","26 November 2023",210,"What a disappointment. This film is BORING. A movie with a huge budget, good actors, about a person as fascinating and complex as Bonaparte, who participated in more than 60 battles and had drama, triumphs and failures that would be enough for a few lifetimes, is... BORING! Nothing is well explained, it's unclear who is who beside Napoleon and Josephine. Several unnecessary sex scenes between the two. What's even worse is that it's unclear why the French nation would follow and worship this Napoleon as he's portrayed in this movie, because in this movie he seems a mediocre personality, without much charisma or extraordinary abilities. In addition, everything on the screen looks greyish blue, without vivid colors, and it is a bit depressing. I liked only two elements of this movie: musical score and costumes."
"Napoleon","levybob","2 December 2023",410,"I read the reviews of Ridley Scott's 'Napoleon' and knew it was not the great film everyone anticipated. Even so, I went. And what I discovered is that it's bad in the worst kind of way; It is dull. Lifeless. A flat un-involving story about characters who are in every way unlikable. Another reviewer wrote that he / she had trouble staying awake through its 2 hours 40 minutes run-time. When I read that I laughed. Now that I have seen the film, I am laughing no longer.Napoleon Bonaparte as Emperor of France did a lot of good things; much of the country's 'Civil Code' was instituted during his reign. But this film deals only with (a) Napoleon the warrior and (b) Napoleon the husband, and fails to deliver a well-rounded character in either sense. We know he loves France but aside from living there we don't know what drives his passion. His hatred for anything not France is clear, but the reasons for this hatred are never explained. There are battles a'plenty but the reason for them is elusive. Enemies become friends. Friends become enemies. We care about none of them. Thousands die. Somehow we care nothing about them either.There is, in Napoleon, no one to root for. Making matters worse there is an uneven performance by Joaquin Phoenix. His 'later' Napoleon becomes a different character than we'd seen earlier in the film. And no, I don't think it is attributed to Napoleon's rise in power. I think it's Phoenix; his acting, his portrayal. His Napoleon is far less quirky as the film progresses (as though the actor wants out of his role), and in this way, he is far less interesting.If there's anyone about whom we do care that character would be Josephine, Napoleon's wife and Empress of France. Vanessa Kirby is ravishing in the role. A rare beauty but one with a shadow-filled past as well as future. We can understand Napoleon's undying love her but the truth is, she's not the nicest girl on the block. There's little doubt that Mr. Bonaparte would never have 'won' her, were he not the country's future leader. So, again, no one to truly root for.Ah, yes. The battle scenes. They're fine (though it seems as though a battle fought at the base of Egypt's pyramids was cut out). But I think fewer battles and more unraveling of the reasons behind those battles between France, England, Russia, Austria, and other countries might make the remaining battles more meaningful.More involving.Which, as I said, this film is definitely not."
"Napoleon","Eleatic67","2 March 2024",610,"The success of any film depends mostly on the script. Why Scott would initiate such an expensive project without ensuring a refined and sophisticated script is a mystery. I'm not convinced there is a single interesting scene that provides insight into the characters or captures through language the prevailing political ideas. Scott's frequent missteps as a director reflect a greater interest in the cinematic rather than in the dramatic. However, this seems inevitable when your priority is delivering a blockbuster that will have broad appeal instead of digging deeper into culture, society, or history. A colossal waste of an extraordinary opportunity to create an important film about a fascinating historical figure."
"Napoleon","Vic_max","22 November 2023",610,"Many of Ridley Scott's movies are like visual masterpieces with epic storylines. I was sort of expecting something like Gladiator. Instead, it was just ""meh"" - I probably would have quit watching if it was on TV.Joaquin Phoenix has demonstrated that he can play odd or troubled characters well, but I don't think he was a good choice for Napoleon. He made the character seem more bizarre than charismatic or leader-like. I think the strongest and most interesting character was actually Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) ... who will probably get the most traction from the movie.The story itself wasn't that interesting because it wasn't explained that well. For example, his departure from Elba island seemed to randomly happen without much explanation. The elevation to a monarch-like role also happens without much explanation. It's like you're watching snippets of a bigger, more interesting story.I become so disconnected from the story that I almost fell asleep during some of the long battle sequences.The movie would probably have been better if it captured just one pivotal event or time period ... or better yet, if it had been a miniseries. While I will still look forward to any future movie from Scott, Napoleon deserved better."
"Napoleon","epicking","23 November 2023",310,"Im only focused on the historical aspect here ... and I only mentions a couple of out many hereIn the beginning, Napoleon abandons a battle at the Egyptian pyramids because Joséphine is unfaithful at home in Paris. It is pure fiction.Much later, when the two have divorced, he marches on Paris from his famous exile on the island of Elba, because he is jealous that the Russian Tsar Alexander is apparently taking a swing with Joséphine. From whom Napoleon, by the way, has long since divorced.It is a distortion of history of the worst kind. Joséphine dies of pneumonia in 1814. Napoleon first marches on Paris in 1815 to regain power, a wild story that could be a whole movie in itself.If you´re gonna make an expensive movie like this, get things right instead of just making romantic stuff up."
"Napoleon","LongTimeMovieLover","23 November 2023",410,"First, let me get this out of the way. If you want to watch a focused masterpiece, watch Waterloo with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. It could have only been better (for me) if Steiger had a French accent. Second, if you want to watch a general scoping history of Napoleon, consider the excellent and approachable Napoleon series with Christian Clavier (with a French accent), Isabella Rossallini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu. (Clavier is sometimes unfairly maligned when indeed he does a splendid job in my view.) There are other well-reputed less approachable versions, but these two are excellent.Now, as this work, let's start with Napoleon. A boyishly handsome, philosophically grounded (Napoleonic Code), egotistical, pugnacious genius, sometimes brooding sometimes loving, sometimes playing. That is, a strategically gifted, tactically trained, boyishly handsome, egotistical, passionate, lovable, fighting, moody, young genius.I am sorry, but this character requires someone like a young Brando or Pacino. Phoenix simply cannot, no-way, pull it off. Way wrong. Crazy wrong. He does not have the range. He is a great actor only in a particular type of role, a crouching villainous Caesar or a depressive Joker. A melancholic low-key whispering introverted Napoleon does not work, and some form of delusion by Scott allowed or put Phoenix into this role. I can easily get past failure of boyish good looks and the way wrong age (and Napoleon's young age is part of the story itself). But I cannot get past whispering tone and failure of charisma, passion and charm. Napoleon seduced a lot of people in a lot of ways.It's not Phoenix's fault he was miscast. Way miscast. Vanessa Kirby was fine and did her job. But, no one in this movie deserves any acting nominations. Take one common scene, being the ""Will you shoot your emperor?"" following Napoleon's escape from Elba and return to France, the other referenced Napoleons had timing, tension, and drama, here blah, nothing. Nothing! It's just bad. Really bad.Nothing in this movie taught me anything, made me think, made me feel, or moved me in any way. Terribly unengaging. Even the couple attempts at comic relief (if there would have been any tension, which was devoid) it was misplaced and failed miserably.Now, let's talk about the versions. This is the 2.5H version and there is another 4H version to be released by Apple+. Everything is a gimmick these days. Every streaming channel has one gem, but I'll suggest this work is inherently flawed by miscast Phoenix and more time to blend the scenes won't do it. In this 2.5H version, it's like a bunch of scenes without any context. We go from the French Revolution through the Reign of Terror through Napoleon's coup through Austerlitz through first defeat through Elba through return to France through Waterloo, through St. Helena. In 2.5H, even with the right actor who has engaging charisma and charm, it's too much ground. No character development whatsoever. None. Even in 4H it's like getting two bad suits for the price of one. It's just more of what's bad, which is miscast Phoenix in the titular role. I only understood the movie because I love and know the history. My wife and 86 year old father could not follow it, and my 19 year old daughter (somewhat tired from returning from college) dozed off a couple of times. No one liked the movie. And we even went out of our way to the IMAX because, well, it was Napoleon.I almost forgot to mention the emasculation of Napoleon by Josephine, the jarring politically correct now-required social normalizing casting of extras, and the ending credits that count the dead but give no context for the concomitant social reforms.Braveheart was historically all wrong, but it was still a great story with a wonderful score. This Napoleon is a bad story, and, even if Napoleon was a fictional character it was still bad. It's both a bad reflection of a real man, a grossly incomplete historical depiction, and a bad story poorly told no matter what.Napoleon was loved, hated, admired and ridiculed, by many of the same people, at different times. He was, if nothing else, one of the greatest characters in the recorded history of mankind. To try to do it all fairly, with the wrong titular actor, is silly. Really silly. Delusively silly.Sir Ridley's movie The Last Duel failed for a similar reason, and then he blames the audience. It's not the production or even perhaps the precise movie direction that is going wrong, it's that the story itself is not well-told. Perhaps it's time for him to teach his tactical craft to a young person with the right vision for the story expression.I need to watch my Waterloo DVD again to get my head back to the right flavor of Napoleon the Great, not Napoleon the Whisperer.Nothing good, new or better. A waste of my time and money."
"Napoleon","heisenberg12","23 November 2023",510,"The title says it all. When anyone thinks about Napolean, they automatically think of the general, the egomaniacal conquerer, military genius who glorified and unified France after the French Revolution.So going into an ""epic"" 2 hour and 40 minute movie, you would safely assume we'd get a glimpse into that twisted, genius mind, especially from an actor like Phoenix, right?Wrong. Instead we get practically a two hour, unoriginal portrait of his banal relationship with Josephine; yes, the rest of the 45 minutes are indeed battles that were good, not great. The lopsided focus on Josephine is unwarranted and unjustified, merely because we didn't learn anything new that we couldn't already assume if it only featured a half hour with their relationship on screen. Honestly, I still cannot fathom any point in that narrative decision after enduring it, as again, there were no twists or startling revelations; if the point was to just humanize Napoleon, we get it, he had a wife and dealt with her toxicity.The best part of the entire movie was the very end when the biographical title cards came up and revealed what a bloodlusting monster he really was, with the visceral explanation of the vast amount of lives he lost in his vain conquests. Back then, the world population was exponentially less than today. Three million in less than twenty years over 61 campaigns, with the Russian incursion costing three hundred plus thousand alone, seventy thousand at Waterloo. It's a shame that most of the tone of the movie not only was wasted on his love life, but moreso did not depict him as the maniacal sociopath he clearly was.On a side note, since we're delving into European French history and this piece failed to capture the period well enough, future filmmakers should hone in on the actual French Revolution. Tale of Two Cities, anyone? Nolan would crush it!4.5/10."
"Napoleon","malmevik77","25 November 2023",210,"NapoleonLet's start with the good things. The battle scenes are well shot, exciting, horrifying, the excellent work one can expect from a Ridley Scott movie.Josephine was fantastic. Her situation was clearly not ideal, and the actress portrayed her in such a way that I felt more for her than anyone else in the film.Now the bad things. All of it. This movie was not good at all. It was such a disappointment. This film had major problems with the flow of the story. It was extremely disjointed. I had no understanding of what was happening as it felt like someone took an outline and only filmed the bullet points, and not the detail beneath it. There is no transition from the coup in 1799 to the coronation in 1804. There is no explanation. There is no context as to how and why this was even acceptable.And don't get me started on historical inaccuracies. The very first scene shows Marie Antoinette getting beheaded in 1789 when that amazing invention called google can tell you otherwise.Maybe I'm being a bit harsh but I've studied English and French history quite extensively and it was cringe worthy to watch. Joaquin Phoenix was also very much miscast. I felt sorry for Vanessa Kirby as she was the highlight of the film. In all honesty, this film should have been called Josephine.I do not recommend watching this unless you're just there for the well shot battle scenes. The lake scene will give you chills. This film was a huge disappointment and I felt embarrassed for the filmmakers."
"Napoleon","itsahoverboard","23 November 2023",510,"Yes, that's a real quote from Joaquin Phoenix to Ridley Scott right before they started filming. I love Joaquin Phoenix, but you can really tell that he doesn't ""get"" the character of Napoleon that he's trying to play. I honestly don't know if Phoenix even has that kind of charisma and confidence within him, but then again I don't know anything about Napoleon either. But it was just uncomfortable watching him stumble his way through the movie, often just looking clueless.The other problem with the movie is it's just plain dull and uninteresting. It really does feel like a ""highlights"" movie. For an almost 3-hour film, it has surprisingly little dialogue. The dialogue that's there isn't' that illuminating or interesting. I normally like politics and romance (which is the bulk of this story), but I would have loved to see more military and war stuff in a movie like this. Isn't Napoleon supposed to be a brilliant war leader? There's like none of that here. Except ""oh we'll do a sneak attack in the night.""The cinematography was also really surprisingly dull. It looked super digital. The colors were so bland and washed out.Vanessa Kirby is really the best thing about the movie. And also the first battle taking over that fort, which was admittedly pretty epic. I have never seen such a thing happen to a horse in a movie, and it was wonderfully horrifying.I fully blame Ridley Scott for this dud. Hopefully Spielberg's Kubrick miniseries about Napoleon will be much better."
"Napoleon","zeki-4","22 November 2023",710,"Back in 2005 Ridley Scott's 144 minute version of 'Kingdom of Heaven' premiered in theatres to somewhat mixed reviews. A couple of years later the vastly superior 190 minute director's cut version finally arrived, with the general consensus that the final product was a masterclass in storytelling, directing, acting and cinematography. - without doubt the best motion picture ever made about the crusades.Almost 20 years later we are yet again treated with a compiled highlight reel of a Ridley Scott movie in the theatre, rather than a full-fledged historical epic, since it has already become official that 'Napoleon' will be released later on streaming with its entire runtime of almost four hours, which clearly is needed to flesh out many parts of the movie and fill in the emotional and historical blanks, because this - somewhat butchered cut - moves in a breakneck speed and feels too rushed.Whereas the underappreciated 1970 movie 'Waterloo' starring Rod Steiger as Napoleon Bonaparte, featuring thousands of extras, portrayed events only during the 100 days campaign in 1815, Scott's 'Napoleon' takes us through decades of various major events and battles beginning with the siege of Toulon in 1793. In this version we never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful. Why did he win the admiration of so many? It's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in real life, but here he is portrayed as a childish brute? It felt like the focus was more on setpieces and his troubled relationship with Josephine, than on him as a ruthless and cunning emperor, and in the theatre cut there really isn't a lot of places where Joaquin Phoenix truly shines as an Oscar contender. Maybe the director's cut will remedy that.In spite of its shortcomings (no pun intended) 'Napoleon' is still one of the best movies I have seen this year, but I am baffled. Because if people can sit through 3+ hour box office hits like 'Avengers Endgame', 'Avatar 2' and 'Oppenheimer' - why the need to release just a very extended trailer of 'Napoleon' in the theatre, especially when everyone know that they can just wait a couple of months for it to arrive on streaming in its entirety? An attempt by Apple at a cash grab? ""You need a subscription to our streaming service to watch the whole thing""?With that being said, I do predict some Oscar nominations here. Ridley Scott yet again proves why he is one of the best filmmakers out there. But a word of caution: If you only plan to see this once, you might consider waiting for the director's cut."
"Napoleon","gcarpiceci","22 November 2023",510,"History is an undesired guest taking the backseat in Mr Scott's sprawling epic on Napoleon's life.Mr Scott's craftsmanship is such that it's undoubtedly able to offer the viewer some unique experiences. But stunning battle visuals and great performances by the lead actors don't make up for gross historical approximation.I have no doubt whatsoever that Mr Scott knows his history and, if he didn't, he surely has a fat staff of assistants to tell it to him; so what he does here (as he did already in Gladiator) is a very deliberate and blatant choice to bend historical reality to the purposes of his own art, which looks like an act of unforgivable artistic hubris."
"Napoleon","richard-1787","27 November 2023",310,"This movie must have cost a fortune to make. (There is no budget listed yet here on IMDB.) You would think they could have spent a little of it on a good script. So many of the problems here stem from the bad script, which does not provide clues about what it going on.What we get is several large-scale but very unexciting battle scenes, where we watch the infantry march into suicidal battle, sometimes led by the cavalry, sometimes followed. In a movie about a fabled tactician, there is no discussion of what made him a success, what he did differently, etc.In between the battle episodes are some of the least romantic, un-erotic love scenes ever filmed. Phoenix and his leading lady have absolutely NO chemistry whatsoever. Half the time he is like a statue with her, the other half like an over-eager dog. We never get a hint of what he might see in her.I stayed through the whole 2.5 hours because I was with friends. Otherwise I would have left mid-way through, or fallen asleep - as Napoleon does several times himself during the battle scenes.I saw Oppenheimer, which is a full three hours long, three times last summer, and was riveted to it all three times. That movie was well directed. This movie didn't hold me at all, had no pacing, and was sometimes confusing even though I have studied that period of French history.Some will find fault with historical inaccuracies. There are evidently a fair number of them. But that doesn't bother me. What bothered me was that Scott and his crew never made this story come alive. Why spend all that money and all those resources on something that just is not interesting?"
"Napoleon","rachelnstephens","22 November 2023",410,"If I knew nothing of Napoleon, I'd be utterly confused about what was happening in this film. There is no hero's journey to follow and nobody to root for.Who is Napoleon? Why is he in France? How did he get to his position? The film begins with the death of Marie Antoinette and pretty much dives right into Napoleon being in charge somehow. Why Napoleon? No idea.Early on we meet Josephine's minor son who is never seen again on screen after a one-on-one meeting with Napoleon. Why does Napoleon meet with him? Why does he grant his request? Why is he interested in Josephine? No idea.The film feels as if you're a time traveller who is moving forward to different snapshots of Napoleon's life. There's little context or explanation. Lots of battle scenes, troop movement, flag signaling and even smelting to make munitions but not a lot of context. Why is Napoleon going here or there? No idea. What is his end goal? No idea. Why do Napoleon's men have an affinity for him? No idea.There are large spans of time between scenes so suddenly Josephine's daughter is a grown adult speaking with Napoleon. No clue who she was until Napoleon mentioned Josephine being her mother. Who are all of these people? No idea. How are they connected? No idea.The film is beautifully shot. The costuming is perfection. The set design is dreamy. Nobody can say that Ridley Scott doesn't know how to make a movie or that Joaquin Phoenix isn't a fantastic actor - it's simply a poor script."
"Napoleon","WadoodS","22 November 2023",510,"Making a movie on a charismatic person like Napoleon is a huge undertaking. It requires in-depth study of his life and then choosing specific events of his life to show and connecting them to perfection. The film maker is short in time therefore it is important for the movie to be precise, fluent and with a purpose. In this movie, the director, Ridley Scott, fails to determine which points of his life he wishes to portray and consequently it results in a piece-by-piece movie which lacks cinematic flow and confuses the audience.The movie disappoints in showing the battles, only briefly does it show the battles of Toulon and Austerlitz and then a bit longer Waterloo, of course concentrating more on Wellington's genius rather than Napoleon's side of things, where there is no mention of Marshal Grouchy's failed mission to block Blucher's army from joining the battle.As great an actor as Joaquin Phoenix is, he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. I felt like Napoleon was intentionally mimicked by the film maker to portray him as a socially awkward person who does not know his way around women, or even his soldiers who loved him so much. During the coup d'etat he is seen as a confused ""coward"" who escapes for his life and is only saved by the cleverness of his brother. But I have personally grown up around military personnel who are calm and composed in the face of adversity and prudently handle critical situations which makes it even more incredible that a military genius of Napoleon's stature would cower under pressure.Joaquin Phoenix's character lacks fundamental personal charisma which is so evident in leaders in general, and military leaders specifically. The movie fails to communicate why then the most civilized, liberal people on the planet earth during that time followed this uncharismatic, bland leader in 61 of his battles? French had already beheaded their king, and all French men were citizens with equal rights - at least only men. No other country in Europe has achieved this level of self-consciousness for human freedom at that time. There is also no mention of his civil, political, artistic achievements like the Code Napoleon or the great artists that flourished under him.Joaquin Phoenix is himself or rather he is still in his Joker character. Apparently, he didn't try enough to get into Napoleon's character. Look at Marlon Brando for example, who shines in his role as Napoleon. Joaquin is so one dimensional who seems to be asleep all the time and has no idea what he is doing while the real Napoleon was an energetic, charismatic, young, and quick individual.I tried to get over his age difference as he is too old to portray such a young person. Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined. He was 35 when he was crowned Emperor of the French. Joaquin Phoenix looks in his fifties in the whole movie. Vanessa Kirby's young age doesn't help much as Josephine was 6 years older. Vanessa Kirby plays brilliantly in her role and dominated every scene she was in as a cold, unfaithful, and then heart-broken queen.It was a brilliant opportunity wasted by the film makers. It could have been much better - as the brilliant life story is already there. The music could have been better. They should have used one of those music/sound directors Christopher Nolan uses in his movies. The cinematography was very good though. The battle scenes were filmed well. My friend pointed out that the cinematographer found his favorite angle on Vaness Kirby when they were in their private bedroom. I laughed more at this joke than at any ""funny"" moments in the movie. Overall, it is a below average movie. Don't go there with your hopes held high. I think Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie. Now I am not sure I will watch the director's cut. I am looking forward to a young, energetic director taking this enterprise and making a Braveheart-like movie."
"Napoleon","M_Exchange","22 November 2023",510,"As many of you know, Stanley Kubrick was obsessed with Napoleon, and he wanted to make his magnum opus about him near the end of his life. He never got around to it. I would have loved to have seen that film.This film is not a total disappointment, but it's far from great. I fell in love with its visuals, and I felt as if I was in the era of the 1790's/early 1800's. Its war scenes are good. Also, I appreciate that it does not hit the three hour mark, but it felt choppy and often incomplete. For instance, when Napoleon got punished a couple of times for his defeats one might think that he cut straight from a loss to a meeting with foreign dignitaries. In actuality, things were much messier in between.I never really felt a romantic spark between him and his first wife, and I never really felt much emotion ever throughout the entirety of the film. Even his death was rather anticlimactic and weak.I would recommend this film only to French people and history buffs."
"Napoleon","dorMancyx","22 November 2023",610,"I feel unsatisfied walking out of that theater after three hours of melancholy and confusion. I understand every single word and every single scene, but when they connect into a whole film I don't understand anything. To start off, the costume/production design, naturalistic sceneries, the two meticulously-depicted ancient warfares --- one amid the doleful squall of Austerlitz and another atop the dampened prairie of Waterloo --- and all other technical stuff are spotless. However, there's an anxiety-inducing problem with the narrative --- the movie has no focus. No climax, no resonating themes like Oppenheimer, just one plain, linear, chronological plot; and even that we get multiple baffling time jumps throughout. The plot is so simple that everything in the film was taught in my AP World History class last year in one day, except it nibbles on some superficial details. Highlighting the relationship between Napolean and Josephine is a unique take, and I do see efforts from the two esteemed performers to capture their mutual toxicity and intricacy, but this love story has barely anything to do with the movie's main arc, Napolean's personal rise and fall. Nothing! Two basically unrelated storylines unfolding in the most bland way possible. Also adding to this insipid mess is the score, which is composed primarily of classical or really old-sounding French folk --- what happened to Radiohead from the trailer? God Ridley I don't wanna say three hours of my life is wasted but it kinda is!I didn't think it was possible but, I think Oppenheimer's winning the Oscar."
"Napoleon","theRetiree","22 November 2023",410,"Just came from a full theater. At the end we got up and left in dead silence. No plot except broad strokes of history, little dialog, no passion, Phoenix seemed catatonic, and the movie was nothing more than set pieces posed to look like romantic paintings by Jacques-Louis David (who actually conveyed more emotion and spirit ). The early climax was Austerlitz, which Scott tried to stage as a replay of the destruction of the Teutonic Knights in Alexander.Nevsky. Wikipedia says maybe two of three soldiers (of thousands of casualties) died in the frozen ponds.Waterloo was equally lame, with French cavalry trying unsuccessfully to break the British Squares looking ridiculously like Plains Indians riding in circles attacking a wagon train. (Mel Brooks staged that better.) And Blucher's timely last minute arrival (which Wellington described as a ""near run thing"") had no tension and no suspense.Beautiful costumes and sets, a case of thousands, but unsatisfying either as historical spectacle or grand love affair, with Phoenix and the director both giving new meaning to the expression ""phoning it in."""
"Napoleon","jozenerd","26 November 2023",310,"During this movie, I just felt like watching a Monty Python's version of Napoleon or a BBC special based on a flyer they took on a train station about Napoleon's affairs and life troubles. Once again, Scott is making out his version of the history or the history that goes with his religion and political views. About Joaquin Phoenix's acting, it's sometimes laughable ala Eddie Redmayne on Jupiter Ascending, Halle Berry on Catwoman, or Marion Cotillard's death scene on Batman, that bad!!! Gosh, this movie is a reminder of past glories that are far gone and Mr. Scott is not deceiving me once again. He did it once with Covenant, guess who did it again? Not Britney!"

"Napoleon","OwneyH","23 November 2023",110,"This was one of the worst big budget movies I have ever seen. I made it toward the later half of the movie and everyone had already walked out, I decided to also walk out. It was the first film I ever walked out on. Here is why:Napoleon opens with what is seemingly going to be a historical biography film adaptation of Napoleon's life, what you instead get is a poorly made, half attempt at a comedy. That's not an exaggeration, it really does play out like a half attempted comedy that's neither funny nor entertaining.It starts in the French Revolution, the first problems was Joaquin Phoenix. I never thought he was a bad actor, but he's bad in this movie. Not only is he a bad Napoleon, not only is he way older looking than actual Napoleon (who is supposed to be 24 at the start of the film), but it's like he didn't even wanna play the role. I don't know what he was going for here but what we got is a bumbling fool with no confidence in any regard, no sign of intelligence, no backstory, no character development, no knowledge of his life outside of his marriage, and above all no historical accuracy whatsoever.This isn't only Joaquin Phoenix's fault, it's Ridley Scott and writer David Scarpa too. Everyone failed this project.If what you were looking for is a film about the Napoleonic Wars, look elsewhere. There is almost no war in it, and what little war there was, is only little clips of warfare, and then straight back to Napoleon's marriage life. Even if you found the marriage stuff interesting about Napoleon, this still isn't the movie for you, because it's not accurate and the film makes it's point early on, but for some reason they keep going over the same ground already covered about Napoleon's love life. It get's very repetitive and quite frankly, boring.These clips of combat we get are completely disconnected from the story, it looks like it's randomly thrown in. They're also really short. If you remember, the trailer has combat in Egypt. You see all that combat in the trailer, that's it. There's no more of it. The trailer was better than the movie.As a history buff (especially history on the French Revolution/Napoleonic Wars) and a film buff, it comes off as offensive to the entire subject matter it's covering in history, offensive to the entire art form of filmmaking, and offensive to the intelligence of it's viewer.It takes nothing seriously, all these huge events regardless of your opinion is treated with disrespect.But most historical events are absent from this film. It focuses so heavily on this marriage story that you don't care about it because the film never tried to make you care, to the point where you feel shocked to see how much time has passed and how many events they skipped when you finally see a date pop up on the screen or an actual recognizable event.Or if you don't know Napoleonic history, you will be entirely lost as to what's happening because it explains nothing, it doesn't even mention why the Napoleonic Wars is happening at all. It doesn't even cover Napoleon growing as a general. Or even growing as a person. The look of Napoleon is even lazily done in this.This version of Napoleon is such a fool instead of a smart general, he makes Napoleon Dynamite look like a cool, collected, Chad.From a film making perspective, the movie is horribly made, generic to bad camera work, a bland soundtrack, HORRIBLE writing, a plot that goes nowhere.The only positives I can find is that some of the costume design is good, the sets are pretty well made, and the one scene in the trailer with the ice was cool. But I'd say watch the trailer again instead of the movie. But that's it. Those are the only good things.If you like Napoleon you won't like this, if you hate Napoleon you won't like this. If you like history you won't like this. If you don't care about history you won't like this. It's poorly made and boring for all. Find any other Napoleon focused movie and I'm sure it will be more entertaining.The trailer makes it seem like a different movie. I feel scammed, I feel lied to.A history film about the Napoleonic Wars with no history, no Napoleonic Wars, and an inaccurate Napoleon that's not fun to watch and at times straight up cringe to witness, makes this movie a solid 1. No entertainment value."
"Napoleon","gmznffvs","22 November 2023",310,"Napoleon is one of the greatest characters in history. He came out of the ashes of the French Revolution to not only lead the country but to inspire it. People were given new hope, aspirations and above all opportunities.Bonaparte created the first meritocracy in Europe. Ordinary people rose to positions of significance in the arts, sciences and all walks of life. In his army almost all the generals came from ordinary backgrounds, whereas pre the Revolution they were aristos.Not one person who doesn't know about Napoleon will know any of this when they come out of the movie.There is nothing to give an insight to his motivation Hint, it wasn't all for Josephine. There was no politics. None of the brilliant generals who fought with him get a look in. Bernadot was invited to be king of Sweden! Talleyrand was a self serving rat, but here is a nobody.Even the election of his brothers to the thrones of other European countries is not worth a mention.Napoleon enjoyed his power. Phoenix mopes about with his usual stone face making every day seem a chore.The only good part, worth the three stars is Waterloo, which is a good battle scene, if not by any means perfect, but watching the move from line to square was satisfying.Now people will think this morose dull man was Napoleon. How could he have been? Why would the French have loved him? Why would they welcome him back.What a disappointment."
"Napoleon","imseeg","23 November 2023",610,"A word of warning for those expecting another Gladiator or non stop action spectacle. It is not. Truly not...The bad: director Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes look slick and impressive (and he does an excellent job again), but he is also known for being quite average at making a drama. And this movie tries (and partly fails) to combine action and drama and somehow ends up being neither one. THAT is one of the reasons I'll only rate it with 6 stars.More bad: this story has a weak ""dramatic"" middle (love story) part, which is kinda tedious. And that brings me to a storyline complaint, namely that this story is all over the place. They cram SO much events and history and different characters from different time periods into this one movie that it kinda confused and numbed me down, instead of thrilling me, as an epic should do.This movie was made for Apple streaming (release date january 2024) in the first place, but they made a shorter (butchered) version for the cinemas in order to be able to compete for the Oscars, which demands that a movie must have run in the cinemas for a couple of weeks. No cinema version, no Oscars.The original Apple streaming version lasted some 2 hours longer. Nobody is gonna sit in the cinema for over 4 hours, hence they cut this movie up and now it feels somewhat rushed, confusing and disjointed at certain moments.Not any good then? Joaquin Phoenix is the one redeeming feature. He nails it.. He makes Napoleon look like a complete joke of a man and I love Joaquin Phoenix' performance, but that unfortunately didnt compensate for the other actors being just about average and with little actor's chemistry between them.I had been warned beforehand by friends that this wasnt the spectacle or epic drama they were hoping for and unfortunately they were right. Certainly not a terrible movie, but one that is just about average.Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb."
"Napoleon","petra_ste","3 December 2023",610,"Ridley Scott directed one of the best movies ever made set during the Napoleonic Wars: unfortunately, that movie is not Napoleon but his cinematic debut, The Duellists, forty years ago.Unsurprisingly, The Duellists had a strong source material (it was based on a novel by Joseph Conrad which it often followed almost verbatim), while Napoleon has an uneven screenplay by David Scarpa.Even past the age of eighty Sir Ridley can still shoot pretty and energetic pictures but his hits and misses depend on the scripts he picks, and he hasn't always shown the best discernment.The elephant in the room is the large amount of historical inaccuracies. Even as a history buff I can forgive many of those: cutting or simplifying events for the sake of narrative, or even some overdramatization like the meeting between Napoleon and Wellington (it never happened) or Napoleon being present at Marie Antoinette's execution (he wasn't); however, stuff like Napoleon charging with his troops at Waterloo is absolute cringe, a kid's (or a lout's) idea of history.Still, the big problems here are characterization and pacing.The movie is a demythologization (some would say emasculation) of Napoleon. If you want to take this route then fair enough, but the character here fails to be consistent. I can buy a Napoleon who is an egomaniac and an overrated tactician (like in Tolstoy's War and Peace). I do not buy one who is an anxious, insecure, uncharismatic cold fish but also a stern tactical genius and an effective leader of men, one who flees from Egypt because Josephine is unfaithful but is also an unflappable military mastermind.Phoenix is a great actor and does what he can but the two sides of the character just don't gel with each other. You can't have parodic moments like Napoleon rolling down the stairs during his coup against the Directory, despondently pouting as he waits for the rain to stop at Waterloo or awkwardly climbing on a box to stand face to face with a pharaoh's mummy (with his diminutive stature becoming a not-too-subtle metaphor of his overall mediocrity)... AND THEN have him magnetically charm the French soldiers into obedience after the Elba. This gawky Napoleon would have been shot to pieces there.The other problem is pacing. A single movie about the whole life of Napoleon is in itself absurd, like making ""a movie about World War 2"". There is material in Napoleon's life for a VERY dense miniseries (which Steven Spielberg is reportedly planning).Napoleon's first wife Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) plays a huge role here but I would argue the movie has either too little or way too much of her. This needed to be either focused mostly on Napoleon's personal life or to drastically reduce the (fairly repetitive after a while) moments where Napoleon is obsessed with his wife.As it is now, it tries to tell - but rushes through - twenty very eventful years of European history and yet devotes more time to Napoleon visiting Josephine after their divorce than to his Russian campaign.It's like making a D-Day movie which keeps cutting back and forth from the Normandy landings to Hitler spending time with Eva Braun. You can have either The Longest Day or Der Untergang, not both.Still, it's not worthless. There are some interesting moments and set-pieces and, while Phoenix is saddled with a contradictory character, Kirby at least is excellent.6/10."
"Napoleon","MissSimonetta","25 November 2023",210,"Ridley Scott's NAPOLEON feels like the highlight reel of a lengthy miniseries. Considering there's a 4-hour cut of this film, that explains it all.NAPOLEON is certainly good spectacle. The battle scenes are breathtaking. Unfortunately, it's also shallow. I know Scott has sneered at viewers criticizing the historical inaccuracies in the film, but I'm more bothered by a total lack of interesting character psychology or even coherent storytelling. Characters pop in and out, leaving little impression in their brief scenes. Relationships between characters are barely fleshed out, including that of Napoleon and Josephine, which dominates the running time. Also, potentially unpopular opinion, I thought Joaquin Phoenix's performance was a one-note bore.Perhaps the 4-hour version is a richer piece of work. As is, NAPOLEON is a let down, especially after Scott's brilliant 2021 period piece THE LAST DUEL, which had all the drama and psychological depth this movie lacked."
"Napoleon","dhunjiwadia","26 November 2023",510,"Ridley Scott's Napoleon is more hysterical than historical. History is like an uninvited guest in this movie. Stunning battle visuals don't make up for gross historical approximations.If you want to watch a masterpiece then see Waterloo, with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. And if you want a historical enumeration then watch the Napoleon series with Christian Clavier, Isabella Rossalini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu.This movie was made for Apple streaming. Then they made a butchered version for cinema to be able to compete for the Oscars. The original Apple streaming version will be at least 2 hours longer. This cut version for cinema is somewhat rushed, disjointed and, as a result, confusing.We never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful and won the admiration of so many. Here it's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in reality, over here he's shown as a childish brute. The focus was more on set pieces and his relationship with Josephine.Joaquin Phoenix can play odd or troubled characters well. Here he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. He's too old for this role (Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined) and made the character seem bizarre than a charismatic leader. Vanessa Kirby as Josephine gets more traction.The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is of a very high order. The battle scenes are filmed well. Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes slick and impressive. But overall it's a below average movie. Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie."
"Napoleon","krzysiektom","26 November 2023",210,"What a disappointment. This film is BORING. A movie with a huge budget, good actors, about a person as fascinating and complex as Bonaparte, who participated in more than 60 battles and had drama, triumphs and failures that would be enough for a few lifetimes, is... BORING! Nothing is well explained, it's unclear who is who beside Napoleon and Josephine. Several unnecessary sex scenes between the two. What's even worse is that it's unclear why the French nation would follow and worship this Napoleon as he's portrayed in this movie, because in this movie he seems a mediocre personality, without much charisma or extraordinary abilities. In addition, everything on the screen looks greyish blue, without vivid colors, and it is a bit depressing. I liked only two elements of this movie: musical score and costumes."
"Napoleon","levybob","2 December 2023",410,"I read the reviews of Ridley Scott's 'Napoleon' and knew it was not the great film everyone anticipated. Even so, I went. And what I discovered is that it's bad in the worst kind of way; It is dull. Lifeless. A flat un-involving story about characters who are in every way unlikable. Another reviewer wrote that he / she had trouble staying awake through its 2 hours 40 minutes run-time. When I read that I laughed. Now that I have seen the film, I am laughing no longer.Napoleon Bonaparte as Emperor of France did a lot of good things; much of the country's 'Civil Code' was instituted during his reign. But this film deals only with (a) Napoleon the warrior and (b) Napoleon the husband, and fails to deliver a well-rounded character in either sense. We know he loves France but aside from living there we don't know what drives his passion. His hatred for anything not France is clear, but the reasons for this hatred are never explained. There are battles a'plenty but the reason for them is elusive. Enemies become friends. Friends become enemies. We care about none of them. Thousands die. Somehow we care nothing about them either.There is, in Napoleon, no one to root for. Making matters worse there is an uneven performance by Joaquin Phoenix. His 'later' Napoleon becomes a different character than we'd seen earlier in the film. And no, I don't think it is attributed to Napoleon's rise in power. I think it's Phoenix; his acting, his portrayal. His Napoleon is far less quirky as the film progresses (as though the actor wants out of his role), and in this way, he is far less interesting.If there's anyone about whom we do care that character would be Josephine, Napoleon's wife and Empress of France. Vanessa Kirby is ravishing in the role. A rare beauty but one with a shadow-filled past as well as future. We can understand Napoleon's undying love her but the truth is, she's not the nicest girl on the block. There's little doubt that Mr. Bonaparte would never have 'won' her, were he not the country's future leader. So, again, no one to truly root for.Ah, yes. The battle scenes. They're fine (though it seems as though a battle fought at the base of Egypt's pyramids was cut out). But I think fewer battles and more unraveling of the reasons behind those battles between France, England, Russia, Austria, and other countries might make the remaining battles more meaningful.More involving.Which, as I said, this film is definitely not."
"Napoleon","Eleatic67","2 March 2024",610,"The success of any film depends mostly on the script. Why Scott would initiate such an expensive project without ensuring a refined and sophisticated script is a mystery. I'm not convinced there is a single interesting scene that provides insight into the characters or captures through language the prevailing political ideas. Scott's frequent missteps as a director reflect a greater interest in the cinematic rather than in the dramatic. However, this seems inevitable when your priority is delivering a blockbuster that will have broad appeal instead of digging deeper into culture, society, or history. A colossal waste of an extraordinary opportunity to create an important film about a fascinating historical figure."
"Napoleon","Vic_max","22 November 2023",610,"Many of Ridley Scott's movies are like visual masterpieces with epic storylines. I was sort of expecting something like Gladiator. Instead, it was just ""meh"" - I probably would have quit watching if it was on TV.Joaquin Phoenix has demonstrated that he can play odd or troubled characters well, but I don't think he was a good choice for Napoleon. He made the character seem more bizarre than charismatic or leader-like. I think the strongest and most interesting character was actually Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) ... who will probably get the most traction from the movie.The story itself wasn't that interesting because it wasn't explained that well. For example, his departure from Elba island seemed to randomly happen without much explanation. The elevation to a monarch-like role also happens without much explanation. It's like you're watching snippets of a bigger, more interesting story.I become so disconnected from the story that I almost fell asleep during some of the long battle sequences.The movie would probably have been better if it captured just one pivotal event or time period ... or better yet, if it had been a miniseries. While I will still look forward to any future movie from Scott, Napoleon deserved better."
"Napoleon","epicking","23 November 2023",310,"Im only focused on the historical aspect here ... and I only mentions a couple of out many hereIn the beginning, Napoleon abandons a battle at the Egyptian pyramids because Joséphine is unfaithful at home in Paris. It is pure fiction.Much later, when the two have divorced, he marches on Paris from his famous exile on the island of Elba, because he is jealous that the Russian Tsar Alexander is apparently taking a swing with Joséphine. From whom Napoleon, by the way, has long since divorced.It is a distortion of history of the worst kind. Joséphine dies of pneumonia in 1814. Napoleon first marches on Paris in 1815 to regain power, a wild story that could be a whole movie in itself.If you´re gonna make an expensive movie like this, get things right instead of just making romantic stuff up."
"Napoleon","LongTimeMovieLover","23 November 2023",410,"First, let me get this out of the way. If you want to watch a focused masterpiece, watch Waterloo with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. It could have only been better (for me) if Steiger had a French accent. Second, if you want to watch a general scoping history of Napoleon, consider the excellent and approachable Napoleon series with Christian Clavier (with a French accent), Isabella Rossallini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu. (Clavier is sometimes unfairly maligned when indeed he does a splendid job in my view.) There are other well-reputed less approachable versions, but these two are excellent.Now, as this work, let's start with Napoleon. A boyishly handsome, philosophically grounded (Napoleonic Code), egotistical, pugnacious genius, sometimes brooding sometimes loving, sometimes playing. That is, a strategically gifted, tactically trained, boyishly handsome, egotistical, passionate, lovable, fighting, moody, young genius.I am sorry, but this character requires someone like a young Brando or Pacino. Phoenix simply cannot, no-way, pull it off. Way wrong. Crazy wrong. He does not have the range. He is a great actor only in a particular type of role, a crouching villainous Caesar or a depressive Joker. A melancholic low-key whispering introverted Napoleon does not work, and some form of delusion by Scott allowed or put Phoenix into this role. I can easily get past failure of boyish good looks and the way wrong age (and Napoleon's young age is part of the story itself). But I cannot get past whispering tone and failure of charisma, passion and charm. Napoleon seduced a lot of people in a lot of ways.It's not Phoenix's fault he was miscast. Way miscast. Vanessa Kirby was fine and did her job. But, no one in this movie deserves any acting nominations. Take one common scene, being the ""Will you shoot your emperor?"" following Napoleon's escape from Elba and return to France, the other referenced Napoleons had timing, tension, and drama, here blah, nothing. Nothing! It's just bad. Really bad.Nothing in this movie taught me anything, made me think, made me feel, or moved me in any way. Terribly unengaging. Even the couple attempts at comic relief (if there would have been any tension, which was devoid) it was misplaced and failed miserably.Now, let's talk about the versions. This is the 2.5H version and there is another 4H version to be released by Apple+. Everything is a gimmick these days. Every streaming channel has one gem, but I'll suggest this work is inherently flawed by miscast Phoenix and more time to blend the scenes won't do it. In this 2.5H version, it's like a bunch of scenes without any context. We go from the French Revolution through the Reign of Terror through Napoleon's coup through Austerlitz through first defeat through Elba through return to France through Waterloo, through St. Helena. In 2.5H, even with the right actor who has engaging charisma and charm, it's too much ground. No character development whatsoever. None. Even in 4H it's like getting two bad suits for the price of one. It's just more of what's bad, which is miscast Phoenix in the titular role. I only understood the movie because I love and know the history. My wife and 86 year old father could not follow it, and my 19 year old daughter (somewhat tired from returning from college) dozed off a couple of times. No one liked the movie. And we even went out of our way to the IMAX because, well, it was Napoleon.I almost forgot to mention the emasculation of Napoleon by Josephine, the jarring politically correct now-required social normalizing casting of extras, and the ending credits that count the dead but give no context for the concomitant social reforms.Braveheart was historically all wrong, but it was still a great story with a wonderful score. This Napoleon is a bad story, and, even if Napoleon was a fictional character it was still bad. It's both a bad reflection of a real man, a grossly incomplete historical depiction, and a bad story poorly told no matter what.Napoleon was loved, hated, admired and ridiculed, by many of the same people, at different times. He was, if nothing else, one of the greatest characters in the recorded history of mankind. To try to do it all fairly, with the wrong titular actor, is silly. Really silly. Delusively silly.Sir Ridley's movie The Last Duel failed for a similar reason, and then he blames the audience. It's not the production or even perhaps the precise movie direction that is going wrong, it's that the story itself is not well-told. Perhaps it's time for him to teach his tactical craft to a young person with the right vision for the story expression.I need to watch my Waterloo DVD again to get my head back to the right flavor of Napoleon the Great, not Napoleon the Whisperer.Nothing good, new or better. A waste of my time and money."
"Napoleon","heisenberg12","23 November 2023",510,"The title says it all. When anyone thinks about Napolean, they automatically think of the general, the egomaniacal conquerer, military genius who glorified and unified France after the French Revolution.So going into an ""epic"" 2 hour and 40 minute movie, you would safely assume we'd get a glimpse into that twisted, genius mind, especially from an actor like Phoenix, right?Wrong. Instead we get practically a two hour, unoriginal portrait of his banal relationship with Josephine; yes, the rest of the 45 minutes are indeed battles that were good, not great. The lopsided focus on Josephine is unwarranted and unjustified, merely because we didn't learn anything new that we couldn't already assume if it only featured a half hour with their relationship on screen. Honestly, I still cannot fathom any point in that narrative decision after enduring it, as again, there were no twists or startling revelations; if the point was to just humanize Napoleon, we get it, he had a wife and dealt with her toxicity.The best part of the entire movie was the very end when the biographical title cards came up and revealed what a bloodlusting monster he really was, with the visceral explanation of the vast amount of lives he lost in his vain conquests. Back then, the world population was exponentially less than today. Three million in less than twenty years over 61 campaigns, with the Russian incursion costing three hundred plus thousand alone, seventy thousand at Waterloo. It's a shame that most of the tone of the movie not only was wasted on his love life, but moreso did not depict him as the maniacal sociopath he clearly was.On a side note, since we're delving into European French history and this piece failed to capture the period well enough, future filmmakers should hone in on the actual French Revolution. Tale of Two Cities, anyone? Nolan would crush it!4.5/10."
"Napoleon","malmevik77","25 November 2023",210,"NapoleonLet's start with the good things. The battle scenes are well shot, exciting, horrifying, the excellent work one can expect from a Ridley Scott movie.Josephine was fantastic. Her situation was clearly not ideal, and the actress portrayed her in such a way that I felt more for her than anyone else in the film.Now the bad things. All of it. This movie was not good at all. It was such a disappointment. This film had major problems with the flow of the story. It was extremely disjointed. I had no understanding of what was happening as it felt like someone took an outline and only filmed the bullet points, and not the detail beneath it. There is no transition from the coup in 1799 to the coronation in 1804. There is no explanation. There is no context as to how and why this was even acceptable.And don't get me started on historical inaccuracies. The very first scene shows Marie Antoinette getting beheaded in 1789 when that amazing invention called google can tell you otherwise.Maybe I'm being a bit harsh but I've studied English and French history quite extensively and it was cringe worthy to watch. Joaquin Phoenix was also very much miscast. I felt sorry for Vanessa Kirby as she was the highlight of the film. In all honesty, this film should have been called Josephine.I do not recommend watching this unless you're just there for the well shot battle scenes. The lake scene will give you chills. This film was a huge disappointment and I felt embarrassed for the filmmakers."
"Napoleon","itsahoverboard","23 November 2023",510,"Yes, that's a real quote from Joaquin Phoenix to Ridley Scott right before they started filming. I love Joaquin Phoenix, but you can really tell that he doesn't ""get"" the character of Napoleon that he's trying to play. I honestly don't know if Phoenix even has that kind of charisma and confidence within him, but then again I don't know anything about Napoleon either. But it was just uncomfortable watching him stumble his way through the movie, often just looking clueless.The other problem with the movie is it's just plain dull and uninteresting. It really does feel like a ""highlights"" movie. For an almost 3-hour film, it has surprisingly little dialogue. The dialogue that's there isn't' that illuminating or interesting. I normally like politics and romance (which is the bulk of this story), but I would have loved to see more military and war stuff in a movie like this. Isn't Napoleon supposed to be a brilliant war leader? There's like none of that here. Except ""oh we'll do a sneak attack in the night.""The cinematography was also really surprisingly dull. It looked super digital. The colors were so bland and washed out.Vanessa Kirby is really the best thing about the movie. And also the first battle taking over that fort, which was admittedly pretty epic. I have never seen such a thing happen to a horse in a movie, and it was wonderfully horrifying.I fully blame Ridley Scott for this dud. Hopefully Spielberg's Kubrick miniseries about Napoleon will be much better."
"Napoleon","zeki-4","22 November 2023",710,"Back in 2005 Ridley Scott's 144 minute version of 'Kingdom of Heaven' premiered in theatres to somewhat mixed reviews. A couple of years later the vastly superior 190 minute director's cut version finally arrived, with the general consensus that the final product was a masterclass in storytelling, directing, acting and cinematography. - without doubt the best motion picture ever made about the crusades.Almost 20 years later we are yet again treated with a compiled highlight reel of a Ridley Scott movie in the theatre, rather than a full-fledged historical epic, since it has already become official that 'Napoleon' will be released later on streaming with its entire runtime of almost four hours, which clearly is needed to flesh out many parts of the movie and fill in the emotional and historical blanks, because this - somewhat butchered cut - moves in a breakneck speed and feels too rushed.Whereas the underappreciated 1970 movie 'Waterloo' starring Rod Steiger as Napoleon Bonaparte, featuring thousands of extras, portrayed events only during the 100 days campaign in 1815, Scott's 'Napoleon' takes us through decades of various major events and battles beginning with the siege of Toulon in 1793. In this version we never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful. Why did he win the admiration of so many? It's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in real life, but here he is portrayed as a childish brute? It felt like the focus was more on setpieces and his troubled relationship with Josephine, than on him as a ruthless and cunning emperor, and in the theatre cut there really isn't a lot of places where Joaquin Phoenix truly shines as an Oscar contender. Maybe the director's cut will remedy that.In spite of its shortcomings (no pun intended) 'Napoleon' is still one of the best movies I have seen this year, but I am baffled. Because if people can sit through 3+ hour box office hits like 'Avengers Endgame', 'Avatar 2' and 'Oppenheimer' - why the need to release just a very extended trailer of 'Napoleon' in the theatre, especially when everyone know that they can just wait a couple of months for it to arrive on streaming in its entirety? An attempt by Apple at a cash grab? ""You need a subscription to our streaming service to watch the whole thing""?With that being said, I do predict some Oscar nominations here. Ridley Scott yet again proves why he is one of the best filmmakers out there. But a word of caution: If you only plan to see this once, you might consider waiting for the director's cut."
"Napoleon","gcarpiceci","22 November 2023",510,"History is an undesired guest taking the backseat in Mr Scott's sprawling epic on Napoleon's life.Mr Scott's craftsmanship is such that it's undoubtedly able to offer the viewer some unique experiences. But stunning battle visuals and great performances by the lead actors don't make up for gross historical approximation.I have no doubt whatsoever that Mr Scott knows his history and, if he didn't, he surely has a fat staff of assistants to tell it to him; so what he does here (as he did already in Gladiator) is a very deliberate and blatant choice to bend historical reality to the purposes of his own art, which looks like an act of unforgivable artistic hubris."
"Napoleon","richard-1787","27 November 2023",310,"This movie must have cost a fortune to make. (There is no budget listed yet here on IMDB.) You would think they could have spent a little of it on a good script. So many of the problems here stem from the bad script, which does not provide clues about what it going on.What we get is several large-scale but very unexciting battle scenes, where we watch the infantry march into suicidal battle, sometimes led by the cavalry, sometimes followed. In a movie about a fabled tactician, there is no discussion of what made him a success, what he did differently, etc.In between the battle episodes are some of the least romantic, un-erotic love scenes ever filmed. Phoenix and his leading lady have absolutely NO chemistry whatsoever. Half the time he is like a statue with her, the other half like an over-eager dog. We never get a hint of what he might see in her.I stayed through the whole 2.5 hours because I was with friends. Otherwise I would have left mid-way through, or fallen asleep - as Napoleon does several times himself during the battle scenes.I saw Oppenheimer, which is a full three hours long, three times last summer, and was riveted to it all three times. That movie was well directed. This movie didn't hold me at all, had no pacing, and was sometimes confusing even though I have studied that period of French history.Some will find fault with historical inaccuracies. There are evidently a fair number of them. But that doesn't bother me. What bothered me was that Scott and his crew never made this story come alive. Why spend all that money and all those resources on something that just is not interesting?"
"Napoleon","rachelnstephens","22 November 2023",410,"If I knew nothing of Napoleon, I'd be utterly confused about what was happening in this film. There is no hero's journey to follow and nobody to root for.Who is Napoleon? Why is he in France? How did he get to his position? The film begins with the death of Marie Antoinette and pretty much dives right into Napoleon being in charge somehow. Why Napoleon? No idea.Early on we meet Josephine's minor son who is never seen again on screen after a one-on-one meeting with Napoleon. Why does Napoleon meet with him? Why does he grant his request? Why is he interested in Josephine? No idea.The film feels as if you're a time traveller who is moving forward to different snapshots of Napoleon's life. There's little context or explanation. Lots of battle scenes, troop movement, flag signaling and even smelting to make munitions but not a lot of context. Why is Napoleon going here or there? No idea. What is his end goal? No idea. Why do Napoleon's men have an affinity for him? No idea.There are large spans of time between scenes so suddenly Josephine's daughter is a grown adult speaking with Napoleon. No clue who she was until Napoleon mentioned Josephine being her mother. Who are all of these people? No idea. How are they connected? No idea.The film is beautifully shot. The costuming is perfection. The set design is dreamy. Nobody can say that Ridley Scott doesn't know how to make a movie or that Joaquin Phoenix isn't a fantastic actor - it's simply a poor script."
"Napoleon","WadoodS","22 November 2023",510,"Making a movie on a charismatic person like Napoleon is a huge undertaking. It requires in-depth study of his life and then choosing specific events of his life to show and connecting them to perfection. The film maker is short in time therefore it is important for the movie to be precise, fluent and with a purpose. In this movie, the director, Ridley Scott, fails to determine which points of his life he wishes to portray and consequently it results in a piece-by-piece movie which lacks cinematic flow and confuses the audience.The movie disappoints in showing the battles, only briefly does it show the battles of Toulon and Austerlitz and then a bit longer Waterloo, of course concentrating more on Wellington's genius rather than Napoleon's side of things, where there is no mention of Marshal Grouchy's failed mission to block Blucher's army from joining the battle.As great an actor as Joaquin Phoenix is, he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. I felt like Napoleon was intentionally mimicked by the film maker to portray him as a socially awkward person who does not know his way around women, or even his soldiers who loved him so much. During the coup d'etat he is seen as a confused ""coward"" who escapes for his life and is only saved by the cleverness of his brother. But I have personally grown up around military personnel who are calm and composed in the face of adversity and prudently handle critical situations which makes it even more incredible that a military genius of Napoleon's stature would cower under pressure.Joaquin Phoenix's character lacks fundamental personal charisma which is so evident in leaders in general, and military leaders specifically. The movie fails to communicate why then the most civilized, liberal people on the planet earth during that time followed this uncharismatic, bland leader in 61 of his battles? French had already beheaded their king, and all French men were citizens with equal rights - at least only men. No other country in Europe has achieved this level of self-consciousness for human freedom at that time. There is also no mention of his civil, political, artistic achievements like the Code Napoleon or the great artists that flourished under him.Joaquin Phoenix is himself or rather he is still in his Joker character. Apparently, he didn't try enough to get into Napoleon's character. Look at Marlon Brando for example, who shines in his role as Napoleon. Joaquin is so one dimensional who seems to be asleep all the time and has no idea what he is doing while the real Napoleon was an energetic, charismatic, young, and quick individual.I tried to get over his age difference as he is too old to portray such a young person. Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined. He was 35 when he was crowned Emperor of the French. Joaquin Phoenix looks in his fifties in the whole movie. Vanessa Kirby's young age doesn't help much as Josephine was 6 years older. Vanessa Kirby plays brilliantly in her role and dominated every scene she was in as a cold, unfaithful, and then heart-broken queen.It was a brilliant opportunity wasted by the film makers. It could have been much better - as the brilliant life story is already there. The music could have been better. They should have used one of those music/sound directors Christopher Nolan uses in his movies. The cinematography was very good though. The battle scenes were filmed well. My friend pointed out that the cinematographer found his favorite angle on Vaness Kirby when they were in their private bedroom. I laughed more at this joke than at any ""funny"" moments in the movie. Overall, it is a below average movie. Don't go there with your hopes held high. I think Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie. Now I am not sure I will watch the director's cut. I am looking forward to a young, energetic director taking this enterprise and making a Braveheart-like movie."
"Napoleon","M_Exchange","22 November 2023",510,"As many of you know, Stanley Kubrick was obsessed with Napoleon, and he wanted to make his magnum opus about him near the end of his life. He never got around to it. I would have loved to have seen that film.This film is not a total disappointment, but it's far from great. I fell in love with its visuals, and I felt as if I was in the era of the 1790's/early 1800's. Its war scenes are good. Also, I appreciate that it does not hit the three hour mark, but it felt choppy and often incomplete. For instance, when Napoleon got punished a couple of times for his defeats one might think that he cut straight from a loss to a meeting with foreign dignitaries. In actuality, things were much messier in between.I never really felt a romantic spark between him and his first wife, and I never really felt much emotion ever throughout the entirety of the film. Even his death was rather anticlimactic and weak.I would recommend this film only to French people and history buffs."
"Napoleon","dorMancyx","22 November 2023",610,"I feel unsatisfied walking out of that theater after three hours of melancholy and confusion. I understand every single word and every single scene, but when they connect into a whole film I don't understand anything. To start off, the costume/production design, naturalistic sceneries, the two meticulously-depicted ancient warfares --- one amid the doleful squall of Austerlitz and another atop the dampened prairie of Waterloo --- and all other technical stuff are spotless. However, there's an anxiety-inducing problem with the narrative --- the movie has no focus. No climax, no resonating themes like Oppenheimer, just one plain, linear, chronological plot; and even that we get multiple baffling time jumps throughout. The plot is so simple that everything in the film was taught in my AP World History class last year in one day, except it nibbles on some superficial details. Highlighting the relationship between Napolean and Josephine is a unique take, and I do see efforts from the two esteemed performers to capture their mutual toxicity and intricacy, but this love story has barely anything to do with the movie's main arc, Napolean's personal rise and fall. Nothing! Two basically unrelated storylines unfolding in the most bland way possible. Also adding to this insipid mess is the score, which is composed primarily of classical or really old-sounding French folk --- what happened to Radiohead from the trailer? God Ridley I don't wanna say three hours of my life is wasted but it kinda is!I didn't think it was possible but, I think Oppenheimer's winning the Oscar."
"Napoleon","theRetiree","22 November 2023",410,"Just came from a full theater. At the end we got up and left in dead silence. No plot except broad strokes of history, little dialog, no passion, Phoenix seemed catatonic, and the movie was nothing more than set pieces posed to look like romantic paintings by Jacques-Louis David (who actually conveyed more emotion and spirit ). The early climax was Austerlitz, which Scott tried to stage as a replay of the destruction of the Teutonic Knights in Alexander.Nevsky. Wikipedia says maybe two of three soldiers (of thousands of casualties) died in the frozen ponds.Waterloo was equally lame, with French cavalry trying unsuccessfully to break the British Squares looking ridiculously like Plains Indians riding in circles attacking a wagon train. (Mel Brooks staged that better.) And Blucher's timely last minute arrival (which Wellington described as a ""near run thing"") had no tension and no suspense.Beautiful costumes and sets, a case of thousands, but unsatisfying either as historical spectacle or grand love affair, with Phoenix and the director both giving new meaning to the expression ""phoning it in."""
"Napoleon","jozenerd","26 November 2023",310,"During this movie, I just felt like watching a Monty Python's version of Napoleon or a BBC special based on a flyer they took on a train station about Napoleon's affairs and life troubles. Once again, Scott is making out his version of the history or the history that goes with his religion and political views. About Joaquin Phoenix's acting, it's sometimes laughable ala Eddie Redmayne on Jupiter Ascending, Halle Berry on Catwoman, or Marion Cotillard's death scene on Batman, that bad!!! Gosh, this movie is a reminder of past glories that are far gone and Mr. Scott is not deceiving me once again. He did it once with Covenant, guess who did it again? Not Britney!"
"Napoleon","nlcckc","23 November 2023",210,"So here is a film about one of the greatest warlords of history, and what do you suppose it emphasizes? If your guess is the yucky ""relationship"" he had with Josephine, you're not far from the truth.Here's what this movie contains:

"Napoleon","OwneyH","23 November 2023",110,"This was one of the worst big budget movies I have ever seen. I made it toward the later half of the movie and everyone had already walked out, I decided to also walk out. It was the first film I ever walked out on. Here is why:Napoleon opens with what is seemingly going to be a historical biography film adaptation of Napoleon's life, what you instead get is a poorly made, half attempt at a comedy. That's not an exaggeration, it really does play out like a half attempted comedy that's neither funny nor entertaining.It starts in the French Revolution, the first problems was Joaquin Phoenix. I never thought he was a bad actor, but he's bad in this movie. Not only is he a bad Napoleon, not only is he way older looking than actual Napoleon (who is supposed to be 24 at the start of the film), but it's like he didn't even wanna play the role. I don't know what he was going for here but what we got is a bumbling fool with no confidence in any regard, no sign of intelligence, no backstory, no character development, no knowledge of his life outside of his marriage, and above all no historical accuracy whatsoever.This isn't only Joaquin Phoenix's fault, it's Ridley Scott and writer David Scarpa too. Everyone failed this project.If what you were looking for is a film about the Napoleonic Wars, look elsewhere. There is almost no war in it, and what little war there was, is only little clips of warfare, and then straight back to Napoleon's marriage life. Even if you found the marriage stuff interesting about Napoleon, this still isn't the movie for you, because it's not accurate and the film makes it's point early on, but for some reason they keep going over the same ground already covered about Napoleon's love life. It get's very repetitive and quite frankly, boring.These clips of combat we get are completely disconnected from the story, it looks like it's randomly thrown in. They're also really short. If you remember, the trailer has combat in Egypt. You see all that combat in the trailer, that's it. There's no more of it. The trailer was better than the movie.As a history buff (especially history on the French Revolution/Napoleonic Wars) and a film buff, it comes off as offensive to the entire subject matter it's covering in history, offensive to the entire art form of filmmaking, and offensive to the intelligence of it's viewer.It takes nothing seriously, all these huge events regardless of your opinion is treated with disrespect.But most historical events are absent from this film. It focuses so heavily on this marriage story that you don't care about it because the film never tried to make you care, to the point where you feel shocked to see how much time has passed and how many events they skipped when you finally see a date pop up on the screen or an actual recognizable event.Or if you don't know Napoleonic history, you will be entirely lost as to what's happening because it explains nothing, it doesn't even mention why the Napoleonic Wars is happening at all. It doesn't even cover Napoleon growing as a general. Or even growing as a person. The look of Napoleon is even lazily done in this.This version of Napoleon is such a fool instead of a smart general, he makes Napoleon Dynamite look like a cool, collected, Chad.From a film making perspective, the movie is horribly made, generic to bad camera work, a bland soundtrack, HORRIBLE writing, a plot that goes nowhere.The only positives I can find is that some of the costume design is good, the sets are pretty well made, and the one scene in the trailer with the ice was cool. But I'd say watch the trailer again instead of the movie. But that's it. Those are the only good things.If you like Napoleon you won't like this, if you hate Napoleon you won't like this. If you like history you won't like this. If you don't care about history you won't like this. It's poorly made and boring for all. Find any other Napoleon focused movie and I'm sure it will be more entertaining.The trailer makes it seem like a different movie. I feel scammed, I feel lied to.A history film about the Napoleonic Wars with no history, no Napoleonic Wars, and an inaccurate Napoleon that's not fun to watch and at times straight up cringe to witness, makes this movie a solid 1. No entertainment value."
"Napoleon","gmznffvs","22 November 2023",310,"Napoleon is one of the greatest characters in history. He came out of the ashes of the French Revolution to not only lead the country but to inspire it. People were given new hope, aspirations and above all opportunities.Bonaparte created the first meritocracy in Europe. Ordinary people rose to positions of significance in the arts, sciences and all walks of life. In his army almost all the generals came from ordinary backgrounds, whereas pre the Revolution they were aristos.Not one person who doesn't know about Napoleon will know any of this when they come out of the movie.There is nothing to give an insight to his motivation Hint, it wasn't all for Josephine. There was no politics. None of the brilliant generals who fought with him get a look in. Bernadot was invited to be king of Sweden! Talleyrand was a self serving rat, but here is a nobody.Even the election of his brothers to the thrones of other European countries is not worth a mention.Napoleon enjoyed his power. Phoenix mopes about with his usual stone face making every day seem a chore.The only good part, worth the three stars is Waterloo, which is a good battle scene, if not by any means perfect, but watching the move from line to square was satisfying.Now people will think this morose dull man was Napoleon. How could he have been? Why would the French have loved him? Why would they welcome him back.What a disappointment."
"Napoleon","imseeg","23 November 2023",610,"A word of warning for those expecting another Gladiator or non stop action spectacle. It is not. Truly not...The bad: director Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes look slick and impressive (and he does an excellent job again), but he is also known for being quite average at making a drama. And this movie tries (and partly fails) to combine action and drama and somehow ends up being neither one. THAT is one of the reasons I'll only rate it with 6 stars.More bad: this story has a weak ""dramatic"" middle (love story) part, which is kinda tedious. And that brings me to a storyline complaint, namely that this story is all over the place. They cram SO much events and history and different characters from different time periods into this one movie that it kinda confused and numbed me down, instead of thrilling me, as an epic should do.This movie was made for Apple streaming (release date january 2024) in the first place, but they made a shorter (butchered) version for the cinemas in order to be able to compete for the Oscars, which demands that a movie must have run in the cinemas for a couple of weeks. No cinema version, no Oscars.The original Apple streaming version lasted some 2 hours longer. Nobody is gonna sit in the cinema for over 4 hours, hence they cut this movie up and now it feels somewhat rushed, confusing and disjointed at certain moments.Not any good then? Joaquin Phoenix is the one redeeming feature. He nails it.. He makes Napoleon look like a complete joke of a man and I love Joaquin Phoenix' performance, but that unfortunately didnt compensate for the other actors being just about average and with little actor's chemistry between them.I had been warned beforehand by friends that this wasnt the spectacle or epic drama they were hoping for and unfortunately they were right. Certainly not a terrible movie, but one that is just about average.Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb."
"Napoleon","petra_ste","3 December 2023",610,"Ridley Scott directed one of the best movies ever made set during the Napoleonic Wars: unfortunately, that movie is not Napoleon but his cinematic debut, The Duellists, forty years ago.Unsurprisingly, The Duellists had a strong source material (it was based on a novel by Joseph Conrad which it often followed almost verbatim), while Napoleon has an uneven screenplay by David Scarpa.Even past the age of eighty Sir Ridley can still shoot pretty and energetic pictures but his hits and misses depend on the scripts he picks, and he hasn't always shown the best discernment.The elephant in the room is the large amount of historical inaccuracies. Even as a history buff I can forgive many of those: cutting or simplifying events for the sake of narrative, or even some overdramatization like the meeting between Napoleon and Wellington (it never happened) or Napoleon being present at Marie Antoinette's execution (he wasn't); however, stuff like Napoleon charging with his troops at Waterloo is absolute cringe, a kid's (or a lout's) idea of history.Still, the big problems here are characterization and pacing.The movie is a demythologization (some would say emasculation) of Napoleon. If you want to take this route then fair enough, but the character here fails to be consistent. I can buy a Napoleon who is an egomaniac and an overrated tactician (like in Tolstoy's War and Peace). I do not buy one who is an anxious, insecure, uncharismatic cold fish but also a stern tactical genius and an effective leader of men, one who flees from Egypt because Josephine is unfaithful but is also an unflappable military mastermind.Phoenix is a great actor and does what he can but the two sides of the character just don't gel with each other. You can't have parodic moments like Napoleon rolling down the stairs during his coup against the Directory, despondently pouting as he waits for the rain to stop at Waterloo or awkwardly climbing on a box to stand face to face with a pharaoh's mummy (with his diminutive stature becoming a not-too-subtle metaphor of his overall mediocrity)... AND THEN have him magnetically charm the French soldiers into obedience after the Elba. This gawky Napoleon would have been shot to pieces there.The other problem is pacing. A single movie about the whole life of Napoleon is in itself absurd, like making ""a movie about World War 2"". There is material in Napoleon's life for a VERY dense miniseries (which Steven Spielberg is reportedly planning).Napoleon's first wife Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) plays a huge role here but I would argue the movie has either too little or way too much of her. This needed to be either focused mostly on Napoleon's personal life or to drastically reduce the (fairly repetitive after a while) moments where Napoleon is obsessed with his wife.As it is now, it tries to tell - but rushes through - twenty very eventful years of European history and yet devotes more time to Napoleon visiting Josephine after their divorce than to his Russian campaign.It's like making a D-Day movie which keeps cutting back and forth from the Normandy landings to Hitler spending time with Eva Braun. You can have either The Longest Day or Der Untergang, not both.Still, it's not worthless. There are some interesting moments and set-pieces and, while Phoenix is saddled with a contradictory character, Kirby at least is excellent.6/10."
"Napoleon","MissSimonetta","25 November 2023",210,"Ridley Scott's NAPOLEON feels like the highlight reel of a lengthy miniseries. Considering there's a 4-hour cut of this film, that explains it all.NAPOLEON is certainly good spectacle. The battle scenes are breathtaking. Unfortunately, it's also shallow. I know Scott has sneered at viewers criticizing the historical inaccuracies in the film, but I'm more bothered by a total lack of interesting character psychology or even coherent storytelling. Characters pop in and out, leaving little impression in their brief scenes. Relationships between characters are barely fleshed out, including that of Napoleon and Josephine, which dominates the running time. Also, potentially unpopular opinion, I thought Joaquin Phoenix's performance was a one-note bore.Perhaps the 4-hour version is a richer piece of work. As is, NAPOLEON is a let down, especially after Scott's brilliant 2021 period piece THE LAST DUEL, which had all the drama and psychological depth this movie lacked."
"Napoleon","dhunjiwadia","26 November 2023",510,"Ridley Scott's Napoleon is more hysterical than historical. History is like an uninvited guest in this movie. Stunning battle visuals don't make up for gross historical approximations.If you want to watch a masterpiece then see Waterloo, with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. And if you want a historical enumeration then watch the Napoleon series with Christian Clavier, Isabella Rossalini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu.This movie was made for Apple streaming. Then they made a butchered version for cinema to be able to compete for the Oscars. The original Apple streaming version will be at least 2 hours longer. This cut version for cinema is somewhat rushed, disjointed and, as a result, confusing.We never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful and won the admiration of so many. Here it's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in reality, over here he's shown as a childish brute. The focus was more on set pieces and his relationship with Josephine.Joaquin Phoenix can play odd or troubled characters well. Here he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. He's too old for this role (Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined) and made the character seem bizarre than a charismatic leader. Vanessa Kirby as Josephine gets more traction.The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is of a very high order. The battle scenes are filmed well. Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes slick and impressive. But overall it's a below average movie. Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie."
"Napoleon","krzysiektom","26 November 2023",210,"What a disappointment. This film is BORING. A movie with a huge budget, good actors, about a person as fascinating and complex as Bonaparte, who participated in more than 60 battles and had drama, triumphs and failures that would be enough for a few lifetimes, is... BORING! Nothing is well explained, it's unclear who is who beside Napoleon and Josephine. Several unnecessary sex scenes between the two. What's even worse is that it's unclear why the French nation would follow and worship this Napoleon as he's portrayed in this movie, because in this movie he seems a mediocre personality, without much charisma or extraordinary abilities. In addition, everything on the screen looks greyish blue, without vivid colors, and it is a bit depressing. I liked only two elements of this movie: musical score and costumes."
"Napoleon","levybob","2 December 2023",410,"I read the reviews of Ridley Scott's 'Napoleon' and knew it was not the great film everyone anticipated. Even so, I went. And what I discovered is that it's bad in the worst kind of way; It is dull. Lifeless. A flat un-involving story about characters who are in every way unlikable. Another reviewer wrote that he / she had trouble staying awake through its 2 hours 40 minutes run-time. When I read that I laughed. Now that I have seen the film, I am laughing no longer.Napoleon Bonaparte as Emperor of France did a lot of good things; much of the country's 'Civil Code' was instituted during his reign. But this film deals only with (a) Napoleon the warrior and (b) Napoleon the husband, and fails to deliver a well-rounded character in either sense. We know he loves France but aside from living there we don't know what drives his passion. His hatred for anything not France is clear, but the reasons for this hatred are never explained. There are battles a'plenty but the reason for them is elusive. Enemies become friends. Friends become enemies. We care about none of them. Thousands die. Somehow we care nothing about them either.There is, in Napoleon, no one to root for. Making matters worse there is an uneven performance by Joaquin Phoenix. His 'later' Napoleon becomes a different character than we'd seen earlier in the film. And no, I don't think it is attributed to Napoleon's rise in power. I think it's Phoenix; his acting, his portrayal. His Napoleon is far less quirky as the film progresses (as though the actor wants out of his role), and in this way, he is far less interesting.If there's anyone about whom we do care that character would be Josephine, Napoleon's wife and Empress of France. Vanessa Kirby is ravishing in the role. A rare beauty but one with a shadow-filled past as well as future. We can understand Napoleon's undying love her but the truth is, she's not the nicest girl on the block. There's little doubt that Mr. Bonaparte would never have 'won' her, were he not the country's future leader. So, again, no one to truly root for.Ah, yes. The battle scenes. They're fine (though it seems as though a battle fought at the base of Egypt's pyramids was cut out). But I think fewer battles and more unraveling of the reasons behind those battles between France, England, Russia, Austria, and other countries might make the remaining battles more meaningful.More involving.Which, as I said, this film is definitely not."
"Napoleon","Eleatic67","2 March 2024",610,"The success of any film depends mostly on the script. Why Scott would initiate such an expensive project without ensuring a refined and sophisticated script is a mystery. I'm not convinced there is a single interesting scene that provides insight into the characters or captures through language the prevailing political ideas. Scott's frequent missteps as a director reflect a greater interest in the cinematic rather than in the dramatic. However, this seems inevitable when your priority is delivering a blockbuster that will have broad appeal instead of digging deeper into culture, society, or history. A colossal waste of an extraordinary opportunity to create an important film about a fascinating historical figure."
"Napoleon","Vic_max","22 November 2023",610,"Many of Ridley Scott's movies are like visual masterpieces with epic storylines. I was sort of expecting something like Gladiator. Instead, it was just ""meh"" - I probably would have quit watching if it was on TV.Joaquin Phoenix has demonstrated that he can play odd or troubled characters well, but I don't think he was a good choice for Napoleon. He made the character seem more bizarre than charismatic or leader-like. I think the strongest and most interesting character was actually Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) ... who will probably get the most traction from the movie.The story itself wasn't that interesting because it wasn't explained that well. For example, his departure from Elba island seemed to randomly happen without much explanation. The elevation to a monarch-like role also happens without much explanation. It's like you're watching snippets of a bigger, more interesting story.I become so disconnected from the story that I almost fell asleep during some of the long battle sequences.The movie would probably have been better if it captured just one pivotal event or time period ... or better yet, if it had been a miniseries. While I will still look forward to any future movie from Scott, Napoleon deserved better."
"Napoleon","epicking","23 November 2023",310,"Im only focused on the historical aspect here ... and I only mentions a couple of out many hereIn the beginning, Napoleon abandons a battle at the Egyptian pyramids because Joséphine is unfaithful at home in Paris. It is pure fiction.Much later, when the two have divorced, he marches on Paris from his famous exile on the island of Elba, because he is jealous that the Russian Tsar Alexander is apparently taking a swing with Joséphine. From whom Napoleon, by the way, has long since divorced.It is a distortion of history of the worst kind. Joséphine dies of pneumonia in 1814. Napoleon first marches on Paris in 1815 to regain power, a wild story that could be a whole movie in itself.If you´re gonna make an expensive movie like this, get things right instead of just making romantic stuff up."
"Napoleon","LongTimeMovieLover","23 November 2023",410,"First, let me get this out of the way. If you want to watch a focused masterpiece, watch Waterloo with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. It could have only been better (for me) if Steiger had a French accent. Second, if you want to watch a general scoping history of Napoleon, consider the excellent and approachable Napoleon series with Christian Clavier (with a French accent), Isabella Rossallini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu. (Clavier is sometimes unfairly maligned when indeed he does a splendid job in my view.) There are other well-reputed less approachable versions, but these two are excellent.Now, as this work, let's start with Napoleon. A boyishly handsome, philosophically grounded (Napoleonic Code), egotistical, pugnacious genius, sometimes brooding sometimes loving, sometimes playing. That is, a strategically gifted, tactically trained, boyishly handsome, egotistical, passionate, lovable, fighting, moody, young genius.I am sorry, but this character requires someone like a young Brando or Pacino. Phoenix simply cannot, no-way, pull it off. Way wrong. Crazy wrong. He does not have the range. He is a great actor only in a particular type of role, a crouching villainous Caesar or a depressive Joker. A melancholic low-key whispering introverted Napoleon does not work, and some form of delusion by Scott allowed or put Phoenix into this role. I can easily get past failure of boyish good looks and the way wrong age (and Napoleon's young age is part of the story itself). But I cannot get past whispering tone and failure of charisma, passion and charm. Napoleon seduced a lot of people in a lot of ways.It's not Phoenix's fault he was miscast. Way miscast. Vanessa Kirby was fine and did her job. But, no one in this movie deserves any acting nominations. Take one common scene, being the ""Will you shoot your emperor?"" following Napoleon's escape from Elba and return to France, the other referenced Napoleons had timing, tension, and drama, here blah, nothing. Nothing! It's just bad. Really bad.Nothing in this movie taught me anything, made me think, made me feel, or moved me in any way. Terribly unengaging. Even the couple attempts at comic relief (if there would have been any tension, which was devoid) it was misplaced and failed miserably.Now, let's talk about the versions. This is the 2.5H version and there is another 4H version to be released by Apple+. Everything is a gimmick these days. Every streaming channel has one gem, but I'll suggest this work is inherently flawed by miscast Phoenix and more time to blend the scenes won't do it. In this 2.5H version, it's like a bunch of scenes without any context. We go from the French Revolution through the Reign of Terror through Napoleon's coup through Austerlitz through first defeat through Elba through return to France through Waterloo, through St. Helena. In 2.5H, even with the right actor who has engaging charisma and charm, it's too much ground. No character development whatsoever. None. Even in 4H it's like getting two bad suits for the price of one. It's just more of what's bad, which is miscast Phoenix in the titular role. I only understood the movie because I love and know the history. My wife and 86 year old father could not follow it, and my 19 year old daughter (somewhat tired from returning from college) dozed off a couple of times. No one liked the movie. And we even went out of our way to the IMAX because, well, it was Napoleon.I almost forgot to mention the emasculation of Napoleon by Josephine, the jarring politically correct now-required social normalizing casting of extras, and the ending credits that count the dead but give no context for the concomitant social reforms.Braveheart was historically all wrong, but it was still a great story with a wonderful score. This Napoleon is a bad story, and, even if Napoleon was a fictional character it was still bad. It's both a bad reflection of a real man, a grossly incomplete historical depiction, and a bad story poorly told no matter what.Napoleon was loved, hated, admired and ridiculed, by many of the same people, at different times. He was, if nothing else, one of the greatest characters in the recorded history of mankind. To try to do it all fairly, with the wrong titular actor, is silly. Really silly. Delusively silly.Sir Ridley's movie The Last Duel failed for a similar reason, and then he blames the audience. It's not the production or even perhaps the precise movie direction that is going wrong, it's that the story itself is not well-told. Perhaps it's time for him to teach his tactical craft to a young person with the right vision for the story expression.I need to watch my Waterloo DVD again to get my head back to the right flavor of Napoleon the Great, not Napoleon the Whisperer.Nothing good, new or better. A waste of my time and money."
"Napoleon","heisenberg12","23 November 2023",510,"The title says it all. When anyone thinks about Napolean, they automatically think of the general, the egomaniacal conquerer, military genius who glorified and unified France after the French Revolution.So going into an ""epic"" 2 hour and 40 minute movie, you would safely assume we'd get a glimpse into that twisted, genius mind, especially from an actor like Phoenix, right?Wrong. Instead we get practically a two hour, unoriginal portrait of his banal relationship with Josephine; yes, the rest of the 45 minutes are indeed battles that were good, not great. The lopsided focus on Josephine is unwarranted and unjustified, merely because we didn't learn anything new that we couldn't already assume if it only featured a half hour with their relationship on screen. Honestly, I still cannot fathom any point in that narrative decision after enduring it, as again, there were no twists or startling revelations; if the point was to just humanize Napoleon, we get it, he had a wife and dealt with her toxicity.The best part of the entire movie was the very end when the biographical title cards came up and revealed what a bloodlusting monster he really was, with the visceral explanation of the vast amount of lives he lost in his vain conquests. Back then, the world population was exponentially less than today. Three million in less than twenty years over 61 campaigns, with the Russian incursion costing three hundred plus thousand alone, seventy thousand at Waterloo. It's a shame that most of the tone of the movie not only was wasted on his love life, but moreso did not depict him as the maniacal sociopath he clearly was.On a side note, since we're delving into European French history and this piece failed to capture the period well enough, future filmmakers should hone in on the actual French Revolution. Tale of Two Cities, anyone? Nolan would crush it!4.5/10."
"Napoleon","malmevik77","25 November 2023",210,"NapoleonLet's start with the good things. The battle scenes are well shot, exciting, horrifying, the excellent work one can expect from a Ridley Scott movie.Josephine was fantastic. Her situation was clearly not ideal, and the actress portrayed her in such a way that I felt more for her than anyone else in the film.Now the bad things. All of it. This movie was not good at all. It was such a disappointment. This film had major problems with the flow of the story. It was extremely disjointed. I had no understanding of what was happening as it felt like someone took an outline and only filmed the bullet points, and not the detail beneath it. There is no transition from the coup in 1799 to the coronation in 1804. There is no explanation. There is no context as to how and why this was even acceptable.And don't get me started on historical inaccuracies. The very first scene shows Marie Antoinette getting beheaded in 1789 when that amazing invention called google can tell you otherwise.Maybe I'm being a bit harsh but I've studied English and French history quite extensively and it was cringe worthy to watch. Joaquin Phoenix was also very much miscast. I felt sorry for Vanessa Kirby as she was the highlight of the film. In all honesty, this film should have been called Josephine.I do not recommend watching this unless you're just there for the well shot battle scenes. The lake scene will give you chills. This film was a huge disappointment and I felt embarrassed for the filmmakers."
"Napoleon","itsahoverboard","23 November 2023",510,"Yes, that's a real quote from Joaquin Phoenix to Ridley Scott right before they started filming. I love Joaquin Phoenix, but you can really tell that he doesn't ""get"" the character of Napoleon that he's trying to play. I honestly don't know if Phoenix even has that kind of charisma and confidence within him, but then again I don't know anything about Napoleon either. But it was just uncomfortable watching him stumble his way through the movie, often just looking clueless.The other problem with the movie is it's just plain dull and uninteresting. It really does feel like a ""highlights"" movie. For an almost 3-hour film, it has surprisingly little dialogue. The dialogue that's there isn't' that illuminating or interesting. I normally like politics and romance (which is the bulk of this story), but I would have loved to see more military and war stuff in a movie like this. Isn't Napoleon supposed to be a brilliant war leader? There's like none of that here. Except ""oh we'll do a sneak attack in the night.""The cinematography was also really surprisingly dull. It looked super digital. The colors were so bland and washed out.Vanessa Kirby is really the best thing about the movie. And also the first battle taking over that fort, which was admittedly pretty epic. I have never seen such a thing happen to a horse in a movie, and it was wonderfully horrifying.I fully blame Ridley Scott for this dud. Hopefully Spielberg's Kubrick miniseries about Napoleon will be much better."
"Napoleon","zeki-4","22 November 2023",710,"Back in 2005 Ridley Scott's 144 minute version of 'Kingdom of Heaven' premiered in theatres to somewhat mixed reviews. A couple of years later the vastly superior 190 minute director's cut version finally arrived, with the general consensus that the final product was a masterclass in storytelling, directing, acting and cinematography. - without doubt the best motion picture ever made about the crusades.Almost 20 years later we are yet again treated with a compiled highlight reel of a Ridley Scott movie in the theatre, rather than a full-fledged historical epic, since it has already become official that 'Napoleon' will be released later on streaming with its entire runtime of almost four hours, which clearly is needed to flesh out many parts of the movie and fill in the emotional and historical blanks, because this - somewhat butchered cut - moves in a breakneck speed and feels too rushed.Whereas the underappreciated 1970 movie 'Waterloo' starring Rod Steiger as Napoleon Bonaparte, featuring thousands of extras, portrayed events only during the 100 days campaign in 1815, Scott's 'Napoleon' takes us through decades of various major events and battles beginning with the siege of Toulon in 1793. In this version we never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful. Why did he win the admiration of so many? It's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in real life, but here he is portrayed as a childish brute? It felt like the focus was more on setpieces and his troubled relationship with Josephine, than on him as a ruthless and cunning emperor, and in the theatre cut there really isn't a lot of places where Joaquin Phoenix truly shines as an Oscar contender. Maybe the director's cut will remedy that.In spite of its shortcomings (no pun intended) 'Napoleon' is still one of the best movies I have seen this year, but I am baffled. Because if people can sit through 3+ hour box office hits like 'Avengers Endgame', 'Avatar 2' and 'Oppenheimer' - why the need to release just a very extended trailer of 'Napoleon' in the theatre, especially when everyone know that they can just wait a couple of months for it to arrive on streaming in its entirety? An attempt by Apple at a cash grab? ""You need a subscription to our streaming service to watch the whole thing""?With that being said, I do predict some Oscar nominations here. Ridley Scott yet again proves why he is one of the best filmmakers out there. But a word of caution: If you only plan to see this once, you might consider waiting for the director's cut."
"Napoleon","gcarpiceci","22 November 2023",510,"History is an undesired guest taking the backseat in Mr Scott's sprawling epic on Napoleon's life.Mr Scott's craftsmanship is such that it's undoubtedly able to offer the viewer some unique experiences. But stunning battle visuals and great performances by the lead actors don't make up for gross historical approximation.I have no doubt whatsoever that Mr Scott knows his history and, if he didn't, he surely has a fat staff of assistants to tell it to him; so what he does here (as he did already in Gladiator) is a very deliberate and blatant choice to bend historical reality to the purposes of his own art, which looks like an act of unforgivable artistic hubris."
"Napoleon","richard-1787","27 November 2023",310,"This movie must have cost a fortune to make. (There is no budget listed yet here on IMDB.) You would think they could have spent a little of it on a good script. So many of the problems here stem from the bad script, which does not provide clues about what it going on.What we get is several large-scale but very unexciting battle scenes, where we watch the infantry march into suicidal battle, sometimes led by the cavalry, sometimes followed. In a movie about a fabled tactician, there is no discussion of what made him a success, what he did differently, etc.In between the battle episodes are some of the least romantic, un-erotic love scenes ever filmed. Phoenix and his leading lady have absolutely NO chemistry whatsoever. Half the time he is like a statue with her, the other half like an over-eager dog. We never get a hint of what he might see in her.I stayed through the whole 2.5 hours because I was with friends. Otherwise I would have left mid-way through, or fallen asleep - as Napoleon does several times himself during the battle scenes.I saw Oppenheimer, which is a full three hours long, three times last summer, and was riveted to it all three times. That movie was well directed. This movie didn't hold me at all, had no pacing, and was sometimes confusing even though I have studied that period of French history.Some will find fault with historical inaccuracies. There are evidently a fair number of them. But that doesn't bother me. What bothered me was that Scott and his crew never made this story come alive. Why spend all that money and all those resources on something that just is not interesting?"
"Napoleon","rachelnstephens","22 November 2023",410,"If I knew nothing of Napoleon, I'd be utterly confused about what was happening in this film. There is no hero's journey to follow and nobody to root for.Who is Napoleon? Why is he in France? How did he get to his position? The film begins with the death of Marie Antoinette and pretty much dives right into Napoleon being in charge somehow. Why Napoleon? No idea.Early on we meet Josephine's minor son who is never seen again on screen after a one-on-one meeting with Napoleon. Why does Napoleon meet with him? Why does he grant his request? Why is he interested in Josephine? No idea.The film feels as if you're a time traveller who is moving forward to different snapshots of Napoleon's life. There's little context or explanation. Lots of battle scenes, troop movement, flag signaling and even smelting to make munitions but not a lot of context. Why is Napoleon going here or there? No idea. What is his end goal? No idea. Why do Napoleon's men have an affinity for him? No idea.There are large spans of time between scenes so suddenly Josephine's daughter is a grown adult speaking with Napoleon. No clue who she was until Napoleon mentioned Josephine being her mother. Who are all of these people? No idea. How are they connected? No idea.The film is beautifully shot. The costuming is perfection. The set design is dreamy. Nobody can say that Ridley Scott doesn't know how to make a movie or that Joaquin Phoenix isn't a fantastic actor - it's simply a poor script."
"Napoleon","WadoodS","22 November 2023",510,"Making a movie on a charismatic person like Napoleon is a huge undertaking. It requires in-depth study of his life and then choosing specific events of his life to show and connecting them to perfection. The film maker is short in time therefore it is important for the movie to be precise, fluent and with a purpose. In this movie, the director, Ridley Scott, fails to determine which points of his life he wishes to portray and consequently it results in a piece-by-piece movie which lacks cinematic flow and confuses the audience.The movie disappoints in showing the battles, only briefly does it show the battles of Toulon and Austerlitz and then a bit longer Waterloo, of course concentrating more on Wellington's genius rather than Napoleon's side of things, where there is no mention of Marshal Grouchy's failed mission to block Blucher's army from joining the battle.As great an actor as Joaquin Phoenix is, he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. I felt like Napoleon was intentionally mimicked by the film maker to portray him as a socially awkward person who does not know his way around women, or even his soldiers who loved him so much. During the coup d'etat he is seen as a confused ""coward"" who escapes for his life and is only saved by the cleverness of his brother. But I have personally grown up around military personnel who are calm and composed in the face of adversity and prudently handle critical situations which makes it even more incredible that a military genius of Napoleon's stature would cower under pressure.Joaquin Phoenix's character lacks fundamental personal charisma which is so evident in leaders in general, and military leaders specifically. The movie fails to communicate why then the most civilized, liberal people on the planet earth during that time followed this uncharismatic, bland leader in 61 of his battles? French had already beheaded their king, and all French men were citizens with equal rights - at least only men. No other country in Europe has achieved this level of self-consciousness for human freedom at that time. There is also no mention of his civil, political, artistic achievements like the Code Napoleon or the great artists that flourished under him.Joaquin Phoenix is himself or rather he is still in his Joker character. Apparently, he didn't try enough to get into Napoleon's character. Look at Marlon Brando for example, who shines in his role as Napoleon. Joaquin is so one dimensional who seems to be asleep all the time and has no idea what he is doing while the real Napoleon was an energetic, charismatic, young, and quick individual.I tried to get over his age difference as he is too old to portray such a young person. Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined. He was 35 when he was crowned Emperor of the French. Joaquin Phoenix looks in his fifties in the whole movie. Vanessa Kirby's young age doesn't help much as Josephine was 6 years older. Vanessa Kirby plays brilliantly in her role and dominated every scene she was in as a cold, unfaithful, and then heart-broken queen.It was a brilliant opportunity wasted by the film makers. It could have been much better - as the brilliant life story is already there. The music could have been better. They should have used one of those music/sound directors Christopher Nolan uses in his movies. The cinematography was very good though. The battle scenes were filmed well. My friend pointed out that the cinematographer found his favorite angle on Vaness Kirby when they were in their private bedroom. I laughed more at this joke than at any ""funny"" moments in the movie. Overall, it is a below average movie. Don't go there with your hopes held high. I think Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie. Now I am not sure I will watch the director's cut. I am looking forward to a young, energetic director taking this enterprise and making a Braveheart-like movie."
"Napoleon","M_Exchange","22 November 2023",510,"As many of you know, Stanley Kubrick was obsessed with Napoleon, and he wanted to make his magnum opus about him near the end of his life. He never got around to it. I would have loved to have seen that film.This film is not a total disappointment, but it's far from great. I fell in love with its visuals, and I felt as if I was in the era of the 1790's/early 1800's. Its war scenes are good. Also, I appreciate that it does not hit the three hour mark, but it felt choppy and often incomplete. For instance, when Napoleon got punished a couple of times for his defeats one might think that he cut straight from a loss to a meeting with foreign dignitaries. In actuality, things were much messier in between.I never really felt a romantic spark between him and his first wife, and I never really felt much emotion ever throughout the entirety of the film. Even his death was rather anticlimactic and weak.I would recommend this film only to French people and history buffs."
"Napoleon","dorMancyx","22 November 2023",610,"I feel unsatisfied walking out of that theater after three hours of melancholy and confusion. I understand every single word and every single scene, but when they connect into a whole film I don't understand anything. To start off, the costume/production design, naturalistic sceneries, the two meticulously-depicted ancient warfares --- one amid the doleful squall of Austerlitz and another atop the dampened prairie of Waterloo --- and all other technical stuff are spotless. However, there's an anxiety-inducing problem with the narrative --- the movie has no focus. No climax, no resonating themes like Oppenheimer, just one plain, linear, chronological plot; and even that we get multiple baffling time jumps throughout. The plot is so simple that everything in the film was taught in my AP World History class last year in one day, except it nibbles on some superficial details. Highlighting the relationship between Napolean and Josephine is a unique take, and I do see efforts from the two esteemed performers to capture their mutual toxicity and intricacy, but this love story has barely anything to do with the movie's main arc, Napolean's personal rise and fall. Nothing! Two basically unrelated storylines unfolding in the most bland way possible. Also adding to this insipid mess is the score, which is composed primarily of classical or really old-sounding French folk --- what happened to Radiohead from the trailer? God Ridley I don't wanna say three hours of my life is wasted but it kinda is!I didn't think it was possible but, I think Oppenheimer's winning the Oscar."
"Napoleon","theRetiree","22 November 2023",410,"Just came from a full theater. At the end we got up and left in dead silence. No plot except broad strokes of history, little dialog, no passion, Phoenix seemed catatonic, and the movie was nothing more than set pieces posed to look like romantic paintings by Jacques-Louis David (who actually conveyed more emotion and spirit ). The early climax was Austerlitz, which Scott tried to stage as a replay of the destruction of the Teutonic Knights in Alexander.Nevsky. Wikipedia says maybe two of three soldiers (of thousands of casualties) died in the frozen ponds.Waterloo was equally lame, with French cavalry trying unsuccessfully to break the British Squares looking ridiculously like Plains Indians riding in circles attacking a wagon train. (Mel Brooks staged that better.) And Blucher's timely last minute arrival (which Wellington described as a ""near run thing"") had no tension and no suspense.Beautiful costumes and sets, a case of thousands, but unsatisfying either as historical spectacle or grand love affair, with Phoenix and the director both giving new meaning to the expression ""phoning it in."""
"Napoleon","jozenerd","26 November 2023",310,"During this movie, I just felt like watching a Monty Python's version of Napoleon or a BBC special based on a flyer they took on a train station about Napoleon's affairs and life troubles. Once again, Scott is making out his version of the history or the history that goes with his religion and political views. About Joaquin Phoenix's acting, it's sometimes laughable ala Eddie Redmayne on Jupiter Ascending, Halle Berry on Catwoman, or Marion Cotillard's death scene on Batman, that bad!!! Gosh, this movie is a reminder of past glories that are far gone and Mr. Scott is not deceiving me once again. He did it once with Covenant, guess who did it again? Not Britney!"
"Napoleon","nlcckc","23 November 2023",210,"So here is a film about one of the greatest warlords of history, and what do you suppose it emphasizes? If your guess is the yucky ""relationship"" he had with Josephine, you're not far from the truth.Here's what this movie contains:

"Napoleon","OwneyH","23 November 2023",110,"This was one of the worst big budget movies I have ever seen. I made it toward the later half of the movie and everyone had already walked out, I decided to also walk out. It was the first film I ever walked out on. Here is why:Napoleon opens with what is seemingly going to be a historical biography film adaptation of Napoleon's life, what you instead get is a poorly made, half attempt at a comedy. That's not an exaggeration, it really does play out like a half attempted comedy that's neither funny nor entertaining.It starts in the French Revolution, the first problems was Joaquin Phoenix. I never thought he was a bad actor, but he's bad in this movie. Not only is he a bad Napoleon, not only is he way older looking than actual Napoleon (who is supposed to be 24 at the start of the film), but it's like he didn't even wanna play the role. I don't know what he was going for here but what we got is a bumbling fool with no confidence in any regard, no sign of intelligence, no backstory, no character development, no knowledge of his life outside of his marriage, and above all no historical accuracy whatsoever.This isn't only Joaquin Phoenix's fault, it's Ridley Scott and writer David Scarpa too. Everyone failed this project.If what you were looking for is a film about the Napoleonic Wars, look elsewhere. There is almost no war in it, and what little war there was, is only little clips of warfare, and then straight back to Napoleon's marriage life. Even if you found the marriage stuff interesting about Napoleon, this still isn't the movie for you, because it's not accurate and the film makes it's point early on, but for some reason they keep going over the same ground already covered about Napoleon's love life. It get's very repetitive and quite frankly, boring.These clips of combat we get are completely disconnected from the story, it looks like it's randomly thrown in. They're also really short. If you remember, the trailer has combat in Egypt. You see all that combat in the trailer, that's it. There's no more of it. The trailer was better than the movie.As a history buff (especially history on the French Revolution/Napoleonic Wars) and a film buff, it comes off as offensive to the entire subject matter it's covering in history, offensive to the entire art form of filmmaking, and offensive to the intelligence of it's viewer.It takes nothing seriously, all these huge events regardless of your opinion is treated with disrespect.But most historical events are absent from this film. It focuses so heavily on this marriage story that you don't care about it because the film never tried to make you care, to the point where you feel shocked to see how much time has passed and how many events they skipped when you finally see a date pop up on the screen or an actual recognizable event.Or if you don't know Napoleonic history, you will be entirely lost as to what's happening because it explains nothing, it doesn't even mention why the Napoleonic Wars is happening at all. It doesn't even cover Napoleon growing as a general. Or even growing as a person. The look of Napoleon is even lazily done in this.This version of Napoleon is such a fool instead of a smart general, he makes Napoleon Dynamite look like a cool, collected, Chad.From a film making perspective, the movie is horribly made, generic to bad camera work, a bland soundtrack, HORRIBLE writing, a plot that goes nowhere.The only positives I can find is that some of the costume design is good, the sets are pretty well made, and the one scene in the trailer with the ice was cool. But I'd say watch the trailer again instead of the movie. But that's it. Those are the only good things.If you like Napoleon you won't like this, if you hate Napoleon you won't like this. If you like history you won't like this. If you don't care about history you won't like this. It's poorly made and boring for all. Find any other Napoleon focused movie and I'm sure it will be more entertaining.The trailer makes it seem like a different movie. I feel scammed, I feel lied to.A history film about the Napoleonic Wars with no history, no Napoleonic Wars, and an inaccurate Napoleon that's not fun to watch and at times straight up cringe to witness, makes this movie a solid 1. No entertainment value."
"Napoleon","gmznffvs","22 November 2023",310,"Napoleon is one of the greatest characters in history. He came out of the ashes of the French Revolution to not only lead the country but to inspire it. People were given new hope, aspirations and above all opportunities.Bonaparte created the first meritocracy in Europe. Ordinary people rose to positions of significance in the arts, sciences and all walks of life. In his army almost all the generals came from ordinary backgrounds, whereas pre the Revolution they were aristos.Not one person who doesn't know about Napoleon will know any of this when they come out of the movie.There is nothing to give an insight to his motivation Hint, it wasn't all for Josephine. There was no politics. None of the brilliant generals who fought with him get a look in. Bernadot was invited to be king of Sweden! Talleyrand was a self serving rat, but here is a nobody.Even the election of his brothers to the thrones of other European countries is not worth a mention.Napoleon enjoyed his power. Phoenix mopes about with his usual stone face making every day seem a chore.The only good part, worth the three stars is Waterloo, which is a good battle scene, if not by any means perfect, but watching the move from line to square was satisfying.Now people will think this morose dull man was Napoleon. How could he have been? Why would the French have loved him? Why would they welcome him back.What a disappointment."
"Napoleon","imseeg","23 November 2023",610,"A word of warning for those expecting another Gladiator or non stop action spectacle. It is not. Truly not...The bad: director Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes look slick and impressive (and he does an excellent job again), but he is also known for being quite average at making a drama. And this movie tries (and partly fails) to combine action and drama and somehow ends up being neither one. THAT is one of the reasons I'll only rate it with 6 stars.More bad: this story has a weak ""dramatic"" middle (love story) part, which is kinda tedious. And that brings me to a storyline complaint, namely that this story is all over the place. They cram SO much events and history and different characters from different time periods into this one movie that it kinda confused and numbed me down, instead of thrilling me, as an epic should do.This movie was made for Apple streaming (release date january 2024) in the first place, but they made a shorter (butchered) version for the cinemas in order to be able to compete for the Oscars, which demands that a movie must have run in the cinemas for a couple of weeks. No cinema version, no Oscars.The original Apple streaming version lasted some 2 hours longer. Nobody is gonna sit in the cinema for over 4 hours, hence they cut this movie up and now it feels somewhat rushed, confusing and disjointed at certain moments.Not any good then? Joaquin Phoenix is the one redeeming feature. He nails it.. He makes Napoleon look like a complete joke of a man and I love Joaquin Phoenix' performance, but that unfortunately didnt compensate for the other actors being just about average and with little actor's chemistry between them.I had been warned beforehand by friends that this wasnt the spectacle or epic drama they were hoping for and unfortunately they were right. Certainly not a terrible movie, but one that is just about average.Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb."
"Napoleon","petra_ste","3 December 2023",610,"Ridley Scott directed one of the best movies ever made set during the Napoleonic Wars: unfortunately, that movie is not Napoleon but his cinematic debut, The Duellists, forty years ago.Unsurprisingly, The Duellists had a strong source material (it was based on a novel by Joseph Conrad which it often followed almost verbatim), while Napoleon has an uneven screenplay by David Scarpa.Even past the age of eighty Sir Ridley can still shoot pretty and energetic pictures but his hits and misses depend on the scripts he picks, and he hasn't always shown the best discernment.The elephant in the room is the large amount of historical inaccuracies. Even as a history buff I can forgive many of those: cutting or simplifying events for the sake of narrative, or even some overdramatization like the meeting between Napoleon and Wellington (it never happened) or Napoleon being present at Marie Antoinette's execution (he wasn't); however, stuff like Napoleon charging with his troops at Waterloo is absolute cringe, a kid's (or a lout's) idea of history.Still, the big problems here are characterization and pacing.The movie is a demythologization (some would say emasculation) of Napoleon. If you want to take this route then fair enough, but the character here fails to be consistent. I can buy a Napoleon who is an egomaniac and an overrated tactician (like in Tolstoy's War and Peace). I do not buy one who is an anxious, insecure, uncharismatic cold fish but also a stern tactical genius and an effective leader of men, one who flees from Egypt because Josephine is unfaithful but is also an unflappable military mastermind.Phoenix is a great actor and does what he can but the two sides of the character just don't gel with each other. You can't have parodic moments like Napoleon rolling down the stairs during his coup against the Directory, despondently pouting as he waits for the rain to stop at Waterloo or awkwardly climbing on a box to stand face to face with a pharaoh's mummy (with his diminutive stature becoming a not-too-subtle metaphor of his overall mediocrity)... AND THEN have him magnetically charm the French soldiers into obedience after the Elba. This gawky Napoleon would have been shot to pieces there.The other problem is pacing. A single movie about the whole life of Napoleon is in itself absurd, like making ""a movie about World War 2"". There is material in Napoleon's life for a VERY dense miniseries (which Steven Spielberg is reportedly planning).Napoleon's first wife Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) plays a huge role here but I would argue the movie has either too little or way too much of her. This needed to be either focused mostly on Napoleon's personal life or to drastically reduce the (fairly repetitive after a while) moments where Napoleon is obsessed with his wife.As it is now, it tries to tell - but rushes through - twenty very eventful years of European history and yet devotes more time to Napoleon visiting Josephine after their divorce than to his Russian campaign.It's like making a D-Day movie which keeps cutting back and forth from the Normandy landings to Hitler spending time with Eva Braun. You can have either The Longest Day or Der Untergang, not both.Still, it's not worthless. There are some interesting moments and set-pieces and, while Phoenix is saddled with a contradictory character, Kirby at least is excellent.6/10."
"Napoleon","MissSimonetta","25 November 2023",210,"Ridley Scott's NAPOLEON feels like the highlight reel of a lengthy miniseries. Considering there's a 4-hour cut of this film, that explains it all.NAPOLEON is certainly good spectacle. The battle scenes are breathtaking. Unfortunately, it's also shallow. I know Scott has sneered at viewers criticizing the historical inaccuracies in the film, but I'm more bothered by a total lack of interesting character psychology or even coherent storytelling. Characters pop in and out, leaving little impression in their brief scenes. Relationships between characters are barely fleshed out, including that of Napoleon and Josephine, which dominates the running time. Also, potentially unpopular opinion, I thought Joaquin Phoenix's performance was a one-note bore.Perhaps the 4-hour version is a richer piece of work. As is, NAPOLEON is a let down, especially after Scott's brilliant 2021 period piece THE LAST DUEL, which had all the drama and psychological depth this movie lacked."
"Napoleon","dhunjiwadia","26 November 2023",510,"Ridley Scott's Napoleon is more hysterical than historical. History is like an uninvited guest in this movie. Stunning battle visuals don't make up for gross historical approximations.If you want to watch a masterpiece then see Waterloo, with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. And if you want a historical enumeration then watch the Napoleon series with Christian Clavier, Isabella Rossalini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu.This movie was made for Apple streaming. Then they made a butchered version for cinema to be able to compete for the Oscars. The original Apple streaming version will be at least 2 hours longer. This cut version for cinema is somewhat rushed, disjointed and, as a result, confusing.We never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful and won the admiration of so many. Here it's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in reality, over here he's shown as a childish brute. The focus was more on set pieces and his relationship with Josephine.Joaquin Phoenix can play odd or troubled characters well. Here he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. He's too old for this role (Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined) and made the character seem bizarre than a charismatic leader. Vanessa Kirby as Josephine gets more traction.The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is of a very high order. The battle scenes are filmed well. Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes slick and impressive. But overall it's a below average movie. Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie."
"Napoleon","krzysiektom","26 November 2023",210,"What a disappointment. This film is BORING. A movie with a huge budget, good actors, about a person as fascinating and complex as Bonaparte, who participated in more than 60 battles and had drama, triumphs and failures that would be enough for a few lifetimes, is... BORING! Nothing is well explained, it's unclear who is who beside Napoleon and Josephine. Several unnecessary sex scenes between the two. What's even worse is that it's unclear why the French nation would follow and worship this Napoleon as he's portrayed in this movie, because in this movie he seems a mediocre personality, without much charisma or extraordinary abilities. In addition, everything on the screen looks greyish blue, without vivid colors, and it is a bit depressing. I liked only two elements of this movie: musical score and costumes."
"Napoleon","levybob","2 December 2023",410,"I read the reviews of Ridley Scott's 'Napoleon' and knew it was not the great film everyone anticipated. Even so, I went. And what I discovered is that it's bad in the worst kind of way; It is dull. Lifeless. A flat un-involving story about characters who are in every way unlikable. Another reviewer wrote that he / she had trouble staying awake through its 2 hours 40 minutes run-time. When I read that I laughed. Now that I have seen the film, I am laughing no longer.Napoleon Bonaparte as Emperor of France did a lot of good things; much of the country's 'Civil Code' was instituted during his reign. But this film deals only with (a) Napoleon the warrior and (b) Napoleon the husband, and fails to deliver a well-rounded character in either sense. We know he loves France but aside from living there we don't know what drives his passion. His hatred for anything not France is clear, but the reasons for this hatred are never explained. There are battles a'plenty but the reason for them is elusive. Enemies become friends. Friends become enemies. We care about none of them. Thousands die. Somehow we care nothing about them either.There is, in Napoleon, no one to root for. Making matters worse there is an uneven performance by Joaquin Phoenix. His 'later' Napoleon becomes a different character than we'd seen earlier in the film. And no, I don't think it is attributed to Napoleon's rise in power. I think it's Phoenix; his acting, his portrayal. His Napoleon is far less quirky as the film progresses (as though the actor wants out of his role), and in this way, he is far less interesting.If there's anyone about whom we do care that character would be Josephine, Napoleon's wife and Empress of France. Vanessa Kirby is ravishing in the role. A rare beauty but one with a shadow-filled past as well as future. We can understand Napoleon's undying love her but the truth is, she's not the nicest girl on the block. There's little doubt that Mr. Bonaparte would never have 'won' her, were he not the country's future leader. So, again, no one to truly root for.Ah, yes. The battle scenes. They're fine (though it seems as though a battle fought at the base of Egypt's pyramids was cut out). But I think fewer battles and more unraveling of the reasons behind those battles between France, England, Russia, Austria, and other countries might make the remaining battles more meaningful.More involving.Which, as I said, this film is definitely not."
"Napoleon","Eleatic67","2 March 2024",610,"The success of any film depends mostly on the script. Why Scott would initiate such an expensive project without ensuring a refined and sophisticated script is a mystery. I'm not convinced there is a single interesting scene that provides insight into the characters or captures through language the prevailing political ideas. Scott's frequent missteps as a director reflect a greater interest in the cinematic rather than in the dramatic. However, this seems inevitable when your priority is delivering a blockbuster that will have broad appeal instead of digging deeper into culture, society, or history. A colossal waste of an extraordinary opportunity to create an important film about a fascinating historical figure."
"Napoleon","Vic_max","22 November 2023",610,"Many of Ridley Scott's movies are like visual masterpieces with epic storylines. I was sort of expecting something like Gladiator. Instead, it was just ""meh"" - I probably would have quit watching if it was on TV.Joaquin Phoenix has demonstrated that he can play odd or troubled characters well, but I don't think he was a good choice for Napoleon. He made the character seem more bizarre than charismatic or leader-like. I think the strongest and most interesting character was actually Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) ... who will probably get the most traction from the movie.The story itself wasn't that interesting because it wasn't explained that well. For example, his departure from Elba island seemed to randomly happen without much explanation. The elevation to a monarch-like role also happens without much explanation. It's like you're watching snippets of a bigger, more interesting story.I become so disconnected from the story that I almost fell asleep during some of the long battle sequences.The movie would probably have been better if it captured just one pivotal event or time period ... or better yet, if it had been a miniseries. While I will still look forward to any future movie from Scott, Napoleon deserved better."
"Napoleon","epicking","23 November 2023",310,"Im only focused on the historical aspect here ... and I only mentions a couple of out many hereIn the beginning, Napoleon abandons a battle at the Egyptian pyramids because Joséphine is unfaithful at home in Paris. It is pure fiction.Much later, when the two have divorced, he marches on Paris from his famous exile on the island of Elba, because he is jealous that the Russian Tsar Alexander is apparently taking a swing with Joséphine. From whom Napoleon, by the way, has long since divorced.It is a distortion of history of the worst kind. Joséphine dies of pneumonia in 1814. Napoleon first marches on Paris in 1815 to regain power, a wild story that could be a whole movie in itself.If you´re gonna make an expensive movie like this, get things right instead of just making romantic stuff up."
"Napoleon","LongTimeMovieLover","23 November 2023",410,"First, let me get this out of the way. If you want to watch a focused masterpiece, watch Waterloo with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. It could have only been better (for me) if Steiger had a French accent. Second, if you want to watch a general scoping history of Napoleon, consider the excellent and approachable Napoleon series with Christian Clavier (with a French accent), Isabella Rossallini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu. (Clavier is sometimes unfairly maligned when indeed he does a splendid job in my view.) There are other well-reputed less approachable versions, but these two are excellent.Now, as this work, let's start with Napoleon. A boyishly handsome, philosophically grounded (Napoleonic Code), egotistical, pugnacious genius, sometimes brooding sometimes loving, sometimes playing. That is, a strategically gifted, tactically trained, boyishly handsome, egotistical, passionate, lovable, fighting, moody, young genius.I am sorry, but this character requires someone like a young Brando or Pacino. Phoenix simply cannot, no-way, pull it off. Way wrong. Crazy wrong. He does not have the range. He is a great actor only in a particular type of role, a crouching villainous Caesar or a depressive Joker. A melancholic low-key whispering introverted Napoleon does not work, and some form of delusion by Scott allowed or put Phoenix into this role. I can easily get past failure of boyish good looks and the way wrong age (and Napoleon's young age is part of the story itself). But I cannot get past whispering tone and failure of charisma, passion and charm. Napoleon seduced a lot of people in a lot of ways.It's not Phoenix's fault he was miscast. Way miscast. Vanessa Kirby was fine and did her job. But, no one in this movie deserves any acting nominations. Take one common scene, being the ""Will you shoot your emperor?"" following Napoleon's escape from Elba and return to France, the other referenced Napoleons had timing, tension, and drama, here blah, nothing. Nothing! It's just bad. Really bad.Nothing in this movie taught me anything, made me think, made me feel, or moved me in any way. Terribly unengaging. Even the couple attempts at comic relief (if there would have been any tension, which was devoid) it was misplaced and failed miserably.Now, let's talk about the versions. This is the 2.5H version and there is another 4H version to be released by Apple+. Everything is a gimmick these days. Every streaming channel has one gem, but I'll suggest this work is inherently flawed by miscast Phoenix and more time to blend the scenes won't do it. In this 2.5H version, it's like a bunch of scenes without any context. We go from the French Revolution through the Reign of Terror through Napoleon's coup through Austerlitz through first defeat through Elba through return to France through Waterloo, through St. Helena. In 2.5H, even with the right actor who has engaging charisma and charm, it's too much ground. No character development whatsoever. None. Even in 4H it's like getting two bad suits for the price of one. It's just more of what's bad, which is miscast Phoenix in the titular role. I only understood the movie because I love and know the history. My wife and 86 year old father could not follow it, and my 19 year old daughter (somewhat tired from returning from college) dozed off a couple of times. No one liked the movie. And we even went out of our way to the IMAX because, well, it was Napoleon.I almost forgot to mention the emasculation of Napoleon by Josephine, the jarring politically correct now-required social normalizing casting of extras, and the ending credits that count the dead but give no context for the concomitant social reforms.Braveheart was historically all wrong, but it was still a great story with a wonderful score. This Napoleon is a bad story, and, even if Napoleon was a fictional character it was still bad. It's both a bad reflection of a real man, a grossly incomplete historical depiction, and a bad story poorly told no matter what.Napoleon was loved, hated, admired and ridiculed, by many of the same people, at different times. He was, if nothing else, one of the greatest characters in the recorded history of mankind. To try to do it all fairly, with the wrong titular actor, is silly. Really silly. Delusively silly.Sir Ridley's movie The Last Duel failed for a similar reason, and then he blames the audience. It's not the production or even perhaps the precise movie direction that is going wrong, it's that the story itself is not well-told. Perhaps it's time for him to teach his tactical craft to a young person with the right vision for the story expression.I need to watch my Waterloo DVD again to get my head back to the right flavor of Napoleon the Great, not Napoleon the Whisperer.Nothing good, new or better. A waste of my time and money."
"Napoleon","heisenberg12","23 November 2023",510,"The title says it all. When anyone thinks about Napolean, they automatically think of the general, the egomaniacal conquerer, military genius who glorified and unified France after the French Revolution.So going into an ""epic"" 2 hour and 40 minute movie, you would safely assume we'd get a glimpse into that twisted, genius mind, especially from an actor like Phoenix, right?Wrong. Instead we get practically a two hour, unoriginal portrait of his banal relationship with Josephine; yes, the rest of the 45 minutes are indeed battles that were good, not great. The lopsided focus on Josephine is unwarranted and unjustified, merely because we didn't learn anything new that we couldn't already assume if it only featured a half hour with their relationship on screen. Honestly, I still cannot fathom any point in that narrative decision after enduring it, as again, there were no twists or startling revelations; if the point was to just humanize Napoleon, we get it, he had a wife and dealt with her toxicity.The best part of the entire movie was the very end when the biographical title cards came up and revealed what a bloodlusting monster he really was, with the visceral explanation of the vast amount of lives he lost in his vain conquests. Back then, the world population was exponentially less than today. Three million in less than twenty years over 61 campaigns, with the Russian incursion costing three hundred plus thousand alone, seventy thousand at Waterloo. It's a shame that most of the tone of the movie not only was wasted on his love life, but moreso did not depict him as the maniacal sociopath he clearly was.On a side note, since we're delving into European French history and this piece failed to capture the period well enough, future filmmakers should hone in on the actual French Revolution. Tale of Two Cities, anyone? Nolan would crush it!4.5/10."
"Napoleon","malmevik77","25 November 2023",210,"NapoleonLet's start with the good things. The battle scenes are well shot, exciting, horrifying, the excellent work one can expect from a Ridley Scott movie.Josephine was fantastic. Her situation was clearly not ideal, and the actress portrayed her in such a way that I felt more for her than anyone else in the film.Now the bad things. All of it. This movie was not good at all. It was such a disappointment. This film had major problems with the flow of the story. It was extremely disjointed. I had no understanding of what was happening as it felt like someone took an outline and only filmed the bullet points, and not the detail beneath it. There is no transition from the coup in 1799 to the coronation in 1804. There is no explanation. There is no context as to how and why this was even acceptable.And don't get me started on historical inaccuracies. The very first scene shows Marie Antoinette getting beheaded in 1789 when that amazing invention called google can tell you otherwise.Maybe I'm being a bit harsh but I've studied English and French history quite extensively and it was cringe worthy to watch. Joaquin Phoenix was also very much miscast. I felt sorry for Vanessa Kirby as she was the highlight of the film. In all honesty, this film should have been called Josephine.I do not recommend watching this unless you're just there for the well shot battle scenes. The lake scene will give you chills. This film was a huge disappointment and I felt embarrassed for the filmmakers."
"Napoleon","itsahoverboard","23 November 2023",510,"Yes, that's a real quote from Joaquin Phoenix to Ridley Scott right before they started filming. I love Joaquin Phoenix, but you can really tell that he doesn't ""get"" the character of Napoleon that he's trying to play. I honestly don't know if Phoenix even has that kind of charisma and confidence within him, but then again I don't know anything about Napoleon either. But it was just uncomfortable watching him stumble his way through the movie, often just looking clueless.The other problem with the movie is it's just plain dull and uninteresting. It really does feel like a ""highlights"" movie. For an almost 3-hour film, it has surprisingly little dialogue. The dialogue that's there isn't' that illuminating or interesting. I normally like politics and romance (which is the bulk of this story), but I would have loved to see more military and war stuff in a movie like this. Isn't Napoleon supposed to be a brilliant war leader? There's like none of that here. Except ""oh we'll do a sneak attack in the night.""The cinematography was also really surprisingly dull. It looked super digital. The colors were so bland and washed out.Vanessa Kirby is really the best thing about the movie. And also the first battle taking over that fort, which was admittedly pretty epic. I have never seen such a thing happen to a horse in a movie, and it was wonderfully horrifying.I fully blame Ridley Scott for this dud. Hopefully Spielberg's Kubrick miniseries about Napoleon will be much better."
"Napoleon","zeki-4","22 November 2023",710,"Back in 2005 Ridley Scott's 144 minute version of 'Kingdom of Heaven' premiered in theatres to somewhat mixed reviews. A couple of years later the vastly superior 190 minute director's cut version finally arrived, with the general consensus that the final product was a masterclass in storytelling, directing, acting and cinematography. - without doubt the best motion picture ever made about the crusades.Almost 20 years later we are yet again treated with a compiled highlight reel of a Ridley Scott movie in the theatre, rather than a full-fledged historical epic, since it has already become official that 'Napoleon' will be released later on streaming with its entire runtime of almost four hours, which clearly is needed to flesh out many parts of the movie and fill in the emotional and historical blanks, because this - somewhat butchered cut - moves in a breakneck speed and feels too rushed.Whereas the underappreciated 1970 movie 'Waterloo' starring Rod Steiger as Napoleon Bonaparte, featuring thousands of extras, portrayed events only during the 100 days campaign in 1815, Scott's 'Napoleon' takes us through decades of various major events and battles beginning with the siege of Toulon in 1793. In this version we never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful. Why did he win the admiration of so many? It's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in real life, but here he is portrayed as a childish brute? It felt like the focus was more on setpieces and his troubled relationship with Josephine, than on him as a ruthless and cunning emperor, and in the theatre cut there really isn't a lot of places where Joaquin Phoenix truly shines as an Oscar contender. Maybe the director's cut will remedy that.In spite of its shortcomings (no pun intended) 'Napoleon' is still one of the best movies I have seen this year, but I am baffled. Because if people can sit through 3+ hour box office hits like 'Avengers Endgame', 'Avatar 2' and 'Oppenheimer' - why the need to release just a very extended trailer of 'Napoleon' in the theatre, especially when everyone know that they can just wait a couple of months for it to arrive on streaming in its entirety? An attempt by Apple at a cash grab? ""You need a subscription to our streaming service to watch the whole thing""?With that being said, I do predict some Oscar nominations here. Ridley Scott yet again proves why he is one of the best filmmakers out there. But a word of caution: If you only plan to see this once, you might consider waiting for the director's cut."
"Napoleon","gcarpiceci","22 November 2023",510,"History is an undesired guest taking the backseat in Mr Scott's sprawling epic on Napoleon's life.Mr Scott's craftsmanship is such that it's undoubtedly able to offer the viewer some unique experiences. But stunning battle visuals and great performances by the lead actors don't make up for gross historical approximation.I have no doubt whatsoever that Mr Scott knows his history and, if he didn't, he surely has a fat staff of assistants to tell it to him; so what he does here (as he did already in Gladiator) is a very deliberate and blatant choice to bend historical reality to the purposes of his own art, which looks like an act of unforgivable artistic hubris."
"Napoleon","richard-1787","27 November 2023",310,"This movie must have cost a fortune to make. (There is no budget listed yet here on IMDB.) You would think they could have spent a little of it on a good script. So many of the problems here stem from the bad script, which does not provide clues about what it going on.What we get is several large-scale but very unexciting battle scenes, where we watch the infantry march into suicidal battle, sometimes led by the cavalry, sometimes followed. In a movie about a fabled tactician, there is no discussion of what made him a success, what he did differently, etc.In between the battle episodes are some of the least romantic, un-erotic love scenes ever filmed. Phoenix and his leading lady have absolutely NO chemistry whatsoever. Half the time he is like a statue with her, the other half like an over-eager dog. We never get a hint of what he might see in her.I stayed through the whole 2.5 hours because I was with friends. Otherwise I would have left mid-way through, or fallen asleep - as Napoleon does several times himself during the battle scenes.I saw Oppenheimer, which is a full three hours long, three times last summer, and was riveted to it all three times. That movie was well directed. This movie didn't hold me at all, had no pacing, and was sometimes confusing even though I have studied that period of French history.Some will find fault with historical inaccuracies. There are evidently a fair number of them. But that doesn't bother me. What bothered me was that Scott and his crew never made this story come alive. Why spend all that money and all those resources on something that just is not interesting?"
"Napoleon","rachelnstephens","22 November 2023",410,"If I knew nothing of Napoleon, I'd be utterly confused about what was happening in this film. There is no hero's journey to follow and nobody to root for.Who is Napoleon? Why is he in France? How did he get to his position? The film begins with the death of Marie Antoinette and pretty much dives right into Napoleon being in charge somehow. Why Napoleon? No idea.Early on we meet Josephine's minor son who is never seen again on screen after a one-on-one meeting with Napoleon. Why does Napoleon meet with him? Why does he grant his request? Why is he interested in Josephine? No idea.The film feels as if you're a time traveller who is moving forward to different snapshots of Napoleon's life. There's little context or explanation. Lots of battle scenes, troop movement, flag signaling and even smelting to make munitions but not a lot of context. Why is Napoleon going here or there? No idea. What is his end goal? No idea. Why do Napoleon's men have an affinity for him? No idea.There are large spans of time between scenes so suddenly Josephine's daughter is a grown adult speaking with Napoleon. No clue who she was until Napoleon mentioned Josephine being her mother. Who are all of these people? No idea. How are they connected? No idea.The film is beautifully shot. The costuming is perfection. The set design is dreamy. Nobody can say that Ridley Scott doesn't know how to make a movie or that Joaquin Phoenix isn't a fantastic actor - it's simply a poor script."
"Napoleon","WadoodS","22 November 2023",510,"Making a movie on a charismatic person like Napoleon is a huge undertaking. It requires in-depth study of his life and then choosing specific events of his life to show and connecting them to perfection. The film maker is short in time therefore it is important for the movie to be precise, fluent and with a purpose. In this movie, the director, Ridley Scott, fails to determine which points of his life he wishes to portray and consequently it results in a piece-by-piece movie which lacks cinematic flow and confuses the audience.The movie disappoints in showing the battles, only briefly does it show the battles of Toulon and Austerlitz and then a bit longer Waterloo, of course concentrating more on Wellington's genius rather than Napoleon's side of things, where there is no mention of Marshal Grouchy's failed mission to block Blucher's army from joining the battle.As great an actor as Joaquin Phoenix is, he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. I felt like Napoleon was intentionally mimicked by the film maker to portray him as a socially awkward person who does not know his way around women, or even his soldiers who loved him so much. During the coup d'etat he is seen as a confused ""coward"" who escapes for his life and is only saved by the cleverness of his brother. But I have personally grown up around military personnel who are calm and composed in the face of adversity and prudently handle critical situations which makes it even more incredible that a military genius of Napoleon's stature would cower under pressure.Joaquin Phoenix's character lacks fundamental personal charisma which is so evident in leaders in general, and military leaders specifically. The movie fails to communicate why then the most civilized, liberal people on the planet earth during that time followed this uncharismatic, bland leader in 61 of his battles? French had already beheaded their king, and all French men were citizens with equal rights - at least only men. No other country in Europe has achieved this level of self-consciousness for human freedom at that time. There is also no mention of his civil, political, artistic achievements like the Code Napoleon or the great artists that flourished under him.Joaquin Phoenix is himself or rather he is still in his Joker character. Apparently, he didn't try enough to get into Napoleon's character. Look at Marlon Brando for example, who shines in his role as Napoleon. Joaquin is so one dimensional who seems to be asleep all the time and has no idea what he is doing while the real Napoleon was an energetic, charismatic, young, and quick individual.I tried to get over his age difference as he is too old to portray such a young person. Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined. He was 35 when he was crowned Emperor of the French. Joaquin Phoenix looks in his fifties in the whole movie. Vanessa Kirby's young age doesn't help much as Josephine was 6 years older. Vanessa Kirby plays brilliantly in her role and dominated every scene she was in as a cold, unfaithful, and then heart-broken queen.It was a brilliant opportunity wasted by the film makers. It could have been much better - as the brilliant life story is already there. The music could have been better. They should have used one of those music/sound directors Christopher Nolan uses in his movies. The cinematography was very good though. The battle scenes were filmed well. My friend pointed out that the cinematographer found his favorite angle on Vaness Kirby when they were in their private bedroom. I laughed more at this joke than at any ""funny"" moments in the movie. Overall, it is a below average movie. Don't go there with your hopes held high. I think Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie. Now I am not sure I will watch the director's cut. I am looking forward to a young, energetic director taking this enterprise and making a Braveheart-like movie."
"Napoleon","M_Exchange","22 November 2023",510,"As many of you know, Stanley Kubrick was obsessed with Napoleon, and he wanted to make his magnum opus about him near the end of his life. He never got around to it. I would have loved to have seen that film.This film is not a total disappointment, but it's far from great. I fell in love with its visuals, and I felt as if I was in the era of the 1790's/early 1800's. Its war scenes are good. Also, I appreciate that it does not hit the three hour mark, but it felt choppy and often incomplete. For instance, when Napoleon got punished a couple of times for his defeats one might think that he cut straight from a loss to a meeting with foreign dignitaries. In actuality, things were much messier in between.I never really felt a romantic spark between him and his first wife, and I never really felt much emotion ever throughout the entirety of the film. Even his death was rather anticlimactic and weak.I would recommend this film only to French people and history buffs."
"Napoleon","dorMancyx","22 November 2023",610,"I feel unsatisfied walking out of that theater after three hours of melancholy and confusion. I understand every single word and every single scene, but when they connect into a whole film I don't understand anything. To start off, the costume/production design, naturalistic sceneries, the two meticulously-depicted ancient warfares --- one amid the doleful squall of Austerlitz and another atop the dampened prairie of Waterloo --- and all other technical stuff are spotless. However, there's an anxiety-inducing problem with the narrative --- the movie has no focus. No climax, no resonating themes like Oppenheimer, just one plain, linear, chronological plot; and even that we get multiple baffling time jumps throughout. The plot is so simple that everything in the film was taught in my AP World History class last year in one day, except it nibbles on some superficial details. Highlighting the relationship between Napolean and Josephine is a unique take, and I do see efforts from the two esteemed performers to capture their mutual toxicity and intricacy, but this love story has barely anything to do with the movie's main arc, Napolean's personal rise and fall. Nothing! Two basically unrelated storylines unfolding in the most bland way possible. Also adding to this insipid mess is the score, which is composed primarily of classical or really old-sounding French folk --- what happened to Radiohead from the trailer? God Ridley I don't wanna say three hours of my life is wasted but it kinda is!I didn't think it was possible but, I think Oppenheimer's winning the Oscar."
"Napoleon","theRetiree","22 November 2023",410,"Just came from a full theater. At the end we got up and left in dead silence. No plot except broad strokes of history, little dialog, no passion, Phoenix seemed catatonic, and the movie was nothing more than set pieces posed to look like romantic paintings by Jacques-Louis David (who actually conveyed more emotion and spirit ). The early climax was Austerlitz, which Scott tried to stage as a replay of the destruction of the Teutonic Knights in Alexander.Nevsky. Wikipedia says maybe two of three soldiers (of thousands of casualties) died in the frozen ponds.Waterloo was equally lame, with French cavalry trying unsuccessfully to break the British Squares looking ridiculously like Plains Indians riding in circles attacking a wagon train. (Mel Brooks staged that better.) And Blucher's timely last minute arrival (which Wellington described as a ""near run thing"") had no tension and no suspense.Beautiful costumes and sets, a case of thousands, but unsatisfying either as historical spectacle or grand love affair, with Phoenix and the director both giving new meaning to the expression ""phoning it in."""
"Napoleon","jozenerd","26 November 2023",310,"During this movie, I just felt like watching a Monty Python's version of Napoleon or a BBC special based on a flyer they took on a train station about Napoleon's affairs and life troubles. Once again, Scott is making out his version of the history or the history that goes with his religion and political views. About Joaquin Phoenix's acting, it's sometimes laughable ala Eddie Redmayne on Jupiter Ascending, Halle Berry on Catwoman, or Marion Cotillard's death scene on Batman, that bad!!! Gosh, this movie is a reminder of past glories that are far gone and Mr. Scott is not deceiving me once again. He did it once with Covenant, guess who did it again? Not Britney!"

"Napoleon","OwneyH","23 November 2023",110,"This was one of the worst big budget movies I have ever seen. I made it toward the later half of the movie and everyone had already walked out, I decided to also walk out. It was the first film I ever walked out on. Here is why:Napoleon opens with what is seemingly going to be a historical biography film adaptation of Napoleon's life, what you instead get is a poorly made, half attempt at a comedy. That's not an exaggeration, it really does play out like a half attempted comedy that's neither funny nor entertaining.It starts in the French Revolution, the first problems was Joaquin Phoenix. I never thought he was a bad actor, but he's bad in this movie. Not only is he a bad Napoleon, not only is he way older looking than actual Napoleon (who is supposed to be 24 at the start of the film), but it's like he didn't even wanna play the role. I don't know what he was going for here but what we got is a bumbling fool with no confidence in any regard, no sign of intelligence, no backstory, no character development, no knowledge of his life outside of his marriage, and above all no historical accuracy whatsoever.This isn't only Joaquin Phoenix's fault, it's Ridley Scott and writer David Scarpa too. Everyone failed this project.If what you were looking for is a film about the Napoleonic Wars, look elsewhere. There is almost no war in it, and what little war there was, is only little clips of warfare, and then straight back to Napoleon's marriage life. Even if you found the marriage stuff interesting about Napoleon, this still isn't the movie for you, because it's not accurate and the film makes it's point early on, but for some reason they keep going over the same ground already covered about Napoleon's love life. It get's very repetitive and quite frankly, boring.These clips of combat we get are completely disconnected from the story, it looks like it's randomly thrown in. They're also really short. If you remember, the trailer has combat in Egypt. You see all that combat in the trailer, that's it. There's no more of it. The trailer was better than the movie.As a history buff (especially history on the French Revolution/Napoleonic Wars) and a film buff, it comes off as offensive to the entire subject matter it's covering in history, offensive to the entire art form of filmmaking, and offensive to the intelligence of it's viewer.It takes nothing seriously, all these huge events regardless of your opinion is treated with disrespect.But most historical events are absent from this film. It focuses so heavily on this marriage story that you don't care about it because the film never tried to make you care, to the point where you feel shocked to see how much time has passed and how many events they skipped when you finally see a date pop up on the screen or an actual recognizable event.Or if you don't know Napoleonic history, you will be entirely lost as to what's happening because it explains nothing, it doesn't even mention why the Napoleonic Wars is happening at all. It doesn't even cover Napoleon growing as a general. Or even growing as a person. The look of Napoleon is even lazily done in this.This version of Napoleon is such a fool instead of a smart general, he makes Napoleon Dynamite look like a cool, collected, Chad.From a film making perspective, the movie is horribly made, generic to bad camera work, a bland soundtrack, HORRIBLE writing, a plot that goes nowhere.The only positives I can find is that some of the costume design is good, the sets are pretty well made, and the one scene in the trailer with the ice was cool. But I'd say watch the trailer again instead of the movie. But that's it. Those are the only good things.If you like Napoleon you won't like this, if you hate Napoleon you won't like this. If you like history you won't like this. If you don't care about history you won't like this. It's poorly made and boring for all. Find any other Napoleon focused movie and I'm sure it will be more entertaining.The trailer makes it seem like a different movie. I feel scammed, I feel lied to.A history film about the Napoleonic Wars with no history, no Napoleonic Wars, and an inaccurate Napoleon that's not fun to watch and at times straight up cringe to witness, makes this movie a solid 1. No entertainment value."
"Napoleon","gmznffvs","22 November 2023",310,"Napoleon is one of the greatest characters in history. He came out of the ashes of the French Revolution to not only lead the country but to inspire it. People were given new hope, aspirations and above all opportunities.Bonaparte created the first meritocracy in Europe. Ordinary people rose to positions of significance in the arts, sciences and all walks of life. In his army almost all the generals came from ordinary backgrounds, whereas pre the Revolution they were aristos.Not one person who doesn't know about Napoleon will know any of this when they come out of the movie.There is nothing to give an insight to his motivation Hint, it wasn't all for Josephine. There was no politics. None of the brilliant generals who fought with him get a look in. Bernadot was invited to be king of Sweden! Talleyrand was a self serving rat, but here is a nobody.Even the election of his brothers to the thrones of other European countries is not worth a mention.Napoleon enjoyed his power. Phoenix mopes about with his usual stone face making every day seem a chore.The only good part, worth the three stars is Waterloo, which is a good battle scene, if not by any means perfect, but watching the move from line to square was satisfying.Now people will think this morose dull man was Napoleon. How could he have been? Why would the French have loved him? Why would they welcome him back.What a disappointment."
"Napoleon","imseeg","23 November 2023",610,"A word of warning for those expecting another Gladiator or non stop action spectacle. It is not. Truly not...The bad: director Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes look slick and impressive (and he does an excellent job again), but he is also known for being quite average at making a drama. And this movie tries (and partly fails) to combine action and drama and somehow ends up being neither one. THAT is one of the reasons I'll only rate it with 6 stars.More bad: this story has a weak ""dramatic"" middle (love story) part, which is kinda tedious. And that brings me to a storyline complaint, namely that this story is all over the place. They cram SO much events and history and different characters from different time periods into this one movie that it kinda confused and numbed me down, instead of thrilling me, as an epic should do.This movie was made for Apple streaming (release date january 2024) in the first place, but they made a shorter (butchered) version for the cinemas in order to be able to compete for the Oscars, which demands that a movie must have run in the cinemas for a couple of weeks. No cinema version, no Oscars.The original Apple streaming version lasted some 2 hours longer. Nobody is gonna sit in the cinema for over 4 hours, hence they cut this movie up and now it feels somewhat rushed, confusing and disjointed at certain moments.Not any good then? Joaquin Phoenix is the one redeeming feature. He nails it.. He makes Napoleon look like a complete joke of a man and I love Joaquin Phoenix' performance, but that unfortunately didnt compensate for the other actors being just about average and with little actor's chemistry between them.I had been warned beforehand by friends that this wasnt the spectacle or epic drama they were hoping for and unfortunately they were right. Certainly not a terrible movie, but one that is just about average.Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb."
"Napoleon","petra_ste","3 December 2023",610,"Ridley Scott directed one of the best movies ever made set during the Napoleonic Wars: unfortunately, that movie is not Napoleon but his cinematic debut, The Duellists, forty years ago.Unsurprisingly, The Duellists had a strong source material (it was based on a novel by Joseph Conrad which it often followed almost verbatim), while Napoleon has an uneven screenplay by David Scarpa.Even past the age of eighty Sir Ridley can still shoot pretty and energetic pictures but his hits and misses depend on the scripts he picks, and he hasn't always shown the best discernment.The elephant in the room is the large amount of historical inaccuracies. Even as a history buff I can forgive many of those: cutting or simplifying events for the sake of narrative, or even some overdramatization like the meeting between Napoleon and Wellington (it never happened) or Napoleon being present at Marie Antoinette's execution (he wasn't); however, stuff like Napoleon charging with his troops at Waterloo is absolute cringe, a kid's (or a lout's) idea of history.Still, the big problems here are characterization and pacing.The movie is a demythologization (some would say emasculation) of Napoleon. If you want to take this route then fair enough, but the character here fails to be consistent. I can buy a Napoleon who is an egomaniac and an overrated tactician (like in Tolstoy's War and Peace). I do not buy one who is an anxious, insecure, uncharismatic cold fish but also a stern tactical genius and an effective leader of men, one who flees from Egypt because Josephine is unfaithful but is also an unflappable military mastermind.Phoenix is a great actor and does what he can but the two sides of the character just don't gel with each other. You can't have parodic moments like Napoleon rolling down the stairs during his coup against the Directory, despondently pouting as he waits for the rain to stop at Waterloo or awkwardly climbing on a box to stand face to face with a pharaoh's mummy (with his diminutive stature becoming a not-too-subtle metaphor of his overall mediocrity)... AND THEN have him magnetically charm the French soldiers into obedience after the Elba. This gawky Napoleon would have been shot to pieces there.The other problem is pacing. A single movie about the whole life of Napoleon is in itself absurd, like making ""a movie about World War 2"". There is material in Napoleon's life for a VERY dense miniseries (which Steven Spielberg is reportedly planning).Napoleon's first wife Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) plays a huge role here but I would argue the movie has either too little or way too much of her. This needed to be either focused mostly on Napoleon's personal life or to drastically reduce the (fairly repetitive after a while) moments where Napoleon is obsessed with his wife.As it is now, it tries to tell - but rushes through - twenty very eventful years of European history and yet devotes more time to Napoleon visiting Josephine after their divorce than to his Russian campaign.It's like making a D-Day movie which keeps cutting back and forth from the Normandy landings to Hitler spending time with Eva Braun. You can have either The Longest Day or Der Untergang, not both.Still, it's not worthless. There are some interesting moments and set-pieces and, while Phoenix is saddled with a contradictory character, Kirby at least is excellent.6/10."
"Napoleon","MissSimonetta","25 November 2023",210,"Ridley Scott's NAPOLEON feels like the highlight reel of a lengthy miniseries. Considering there's a 4-hour cut of this film, that explains it all.NAPOLEON is certainly good spectacle. The battle scenes are breathtaking. Unfortunately, it's also shallow. I know Scott has sneered at viewers criticizing the historical inaccuracies in the film, but I'm more bothered by a total lack of interesting character psychology or even coherent storytelling. Characters pop in and out, leaving little impression in their brief scenes. Relationships between characters are barely fleshed out, including that of Napoleon and Josephine, which dominates the running time. Also, potentially unpopular opinion, I thought Joaquin Phoenix's performance was a one-note bore.Perhaps the 4-hour version is a richer piece of work. As is, NAPOLEON is a let down, especially after Scott's brilliant 2021 period piece THE LAST DUEL, which had all the drama and psychological depth this movie lacked."
"Napoleon","dhunjiwadia","26 November 2023",510,"Ridley Scott's Napoleon is more hysterical than historical. History is like an uninvited guest in this movie. Stunning battle visuals don't make up for gross historical approximations.If you want to watch a masterpiece then see Waterloo, with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. And if you want a historical enumeration then watch the Napoleon series with Christian Clavier, Isabella Rossalini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu.This movie was made for Apple streaming. Then they made a butchered version for cinema to be able to compete for the Oscars. The original Apple streaming version will be at least 2 hours longer. This cut version for cinema is somewhat rushed, disjointed and, as a result, confusing.We never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful and won the admiration of so many. Here it's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in reality, over here he's shown as a childish brute. The focus was more on set pieces and his relationship with Josephine.Joaquin Phoenix can play odd or troubled characters well. Here he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. He's too old for this role (Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined) and made the character seem bizarre than a charismatic leader. Vanessa Kirby as Josephine gets more traction.The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is of a very high order. The battle scenes are filmed well. Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes slick and impressive. But overall it's a below average movie. Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie."
"Napoleon","krzysiektom","26 November 2023",210,"What a disappointment. This film is BORING. A movie with a huge budget, good actors, about a person as fascinating and complex as Bonaparte, who participated in more than 60 battles and had drama, triumphs and failures that would be enough for a few lifetimes, is... BORING! Nothing is well explained, it's unclear who is who beside Napoleon and Josephine. Several unnecessary sex scenes between the two. What's even worse is that it's unclear why the French nation would follow and worship this Napoleon as he's portrayed in this movie, because in this movie he seems a mediocre personality, without much charisma or extraordinary abilities. In addition, everything on the screen looks greyish blue, without vivid colors, and it is a bit depressing. I liked only two elements of this movie: musical score and costumes."
"Napoleon","levybob","2 December 2023",410,"I read the reviews of Ridley Scott's 'Napoleon' and knew it was not the great film everyone anticipated. Even so, I went. And what I discovered is that it's bad in the worst kind of way; It is dull. Lifeless. A flat un-involving story about characters who are in every way unlikable. Another reviewer wrote that he / she had trouble staying awake through its 2 hours 40 minutes run-time. When I read that I laughed. Now that I have seen the film, I am laughing no longer.Napoleon Bonaparte as Emperor of France did a lot of good things; much of the country's 'Civil Code' was instituted during his reign. But this film deals only with (a) Napoleon the warrior and (b) Napoleon the husband, and fails to deliver a well-rounded character in either sense. We know he loves France but aside from living there we don't know what drives his passion. His hatred for anything not France is clear, but the reasons for this hatred are never explained. There are battles a'plenty but the reason for them is elusive. Enemies become friends. Friends become enemies. We care about none of them. Thousands die. Somehow we care nothing about them either.There is, in Napoleon, no one to root for. Making matters worse there is an uneven performance by Joaquin Phoenix. His 'later' Napoleon becomes a different character than we'd seen earlier in the film. And no, I don't think it is attributed to Napoleon's rise in power. I think it's Phoenix; his acting, his portrayal. His Napoleon is far less quirky as the film progresses (as though the actor wants out of his role), and in this way, he is far less interesting.If there's anyone about whom we do care that character would be Josephine, Napoleon's wife and Empress of France. Vanessa Kirby is ravishing in the role. A rare beauty but one with a shadow-filled past as well as future. We can understand Napoleon's undying love her but the truth is, she's not the nicest girl on the block. There's little doubt that Mr. Bonaparte would never have 'won' her, were he not the country's future leader. So, again, no one to truly root for.Ah, yes. The battle scenes. They're fine (though it seems as though a battle fought at the base of Egypt's pyramids was cut out). But I think fewer battles and more unraveling of the reasons behind those battles between France, England, Russia, Austria, and other countries might make the remaining battles more meaningful.More involving.Which, as I said, this film is definitely not."
"Napoleon","Eleatic67","2 March 2024",610,"The success of any film depends mostly on the script. Why Scott would initiate such an expensive project without ensuring a refined and sophisticated script is a mystery. I'm not convinced there is a single interesting scene that provides insight into the characters or captures through language the prevailing political ideas. Scott's frequent missteps as a director reflect a greater interest in the cinematic rather than in the dramatic. However, this seems inevitable when your priority is delivering a blockbuster that will have broad appeal instead of digging deeper into culture, society, or history. A colossal waste of an extraordinary opportunity to create an important film about a fascinating historical figure."
"Napoleon","Vic_max","22 November 2023",610,"Many of Ridley Scott's movies are like visual masterpieces with epic storylines. I was sort of expecting something like Gladiator. Instead, it was just ""meh"" - I probably would have quit watching if it was on TV.Joaquin Phoenix has demonstrated that he can play odd or troubled characters well, but I don't think he was a good choice for Napoleon. He made the character seem more bizarre than charismatic or leader-like. I think the strongest and most interesting character was actually Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) ... who will probably get the most traction from the movie.The story itself wasn't that interesting because it wasn't explained that well. For example, his departure from Elba island seemed to randomly happen without much explanation. The elevation to a monarch-like role also happens without much explanation. It's like you're watching snippets of a bigger, more interesting story.I become so disconnected from the story that I almost fell asleep during some of the long battle sequences.The movie would probably have been better if it captured just one pivotal event or time period ... or better yet, if it had been a miniseries. While I will still look forward to any future movie from Scott, Napoleon deserved better."
"Napoleon","epicking","23 November 2023",310,"Im only focused on the historical aspect here ... and I only mentions a couple of out many hereIn the beginning, Napoleon abandons a battle at the Egyptian pyramids because Joséphine is unfaithful at home in Paris. It is pure fiction.Much later, when the two have divorced, he marches on Paris from his famous exile on the island of Elba, because he is jealous that the Russian Tsar Alexander is apparently taking a swing with Joséphine. From whom Napoleon, by the way, has long since divorced.It is a distortion of history of the worst kind. Joséphine dies of pneumonia in 1814. Napoleon first marches on Paris in 1815 to regain power, a wild story that could be a whole movie in itself.If you´re gonna make an expensive movie like this, get things right instead of just making romantic stuff up."
"Napoleon","LongTimeMovieLover","23 November 2023",410,"First, let me get this out of the way. If you want to watch a focused masterpiece, watch Waterloo with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. It could have only been better (for me) if Steiger had a French accent. Second, if you want to watch a general scoping history of Napoleon, consider the excellent and approachable Napoleon series with Christian Clavier (with a French accent), Isabella Rossallini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu. (Clavier is sometimes unfairly maligned when indeed he does a splendid job in my view.) There are other well-reputed less approachable versions, but these two are excellent.Now, as this work, let's start with Napoleon. A boyishly handsome, philosophically grounded (Napoleonic Code), egotistical, pugnacious genius, sometimes brooding sometimes loving, sometimes playing. That is, a strategically gifted, tactically trained, boyishly handsome, egotistical, passionate, lovable, fighting, moody, young genius.I am sorry, but this character requires someone like a young Brando or Pacino. Phoenix simply cannot, no-way, pull it off. Way wrong. Crazy wrong. He does not have the range. He is a great actor only in a particular type of role, a crouching villainous Caesar or a depressive Joker. A melancholic low-key whispering introverted Napoleon does not work, and some form of delusion by Scott allowed or put Phoenix into this role. I can easily get past failure of boyish good looks and the way wrong age (and Napoleon's young age is part of the story itself). But I cannot get past whispering tone and failure of charisma, passion and charm. Napoleon seduced a lot of people in a lot of ways.It's not Phoenix's fault he was miscast. Way miscast. Vanessa Kirby was fine and did her job. But, no one in this movie deserves any acting nominations. Take one common scene, being the ""Will you shoot your emperor?"" following Napoleon's escape from Elba and return to France, the other referenced Napoleons had timing, tension, and drama, here blah, nothing. Nothing! It's just bad. Really bad.Nothing in this movie taught me anything, made me think, made me feel, or moved me in any way. Terribly unengaging. Even the couple attempts at comic relief (if there would have been any tension, which was devoid) it was misplaced and failed miserably.Now, let's talk about the versions. This is the 2.5H version and there is another 4H version to be released by Apple+. Everything is a gimmick these days. Every streaming channel has one gem, but I'll suggest this work is inherently flawed by miscast Phoenix and more time to blend the scenes won't do it. In this 2.5H version, it's like a bunch of scenes without any context. We go from the French Revolution through the Reign of Terror through Napoleon's coup through Austerlitz through first defeat through Elba through return to France through Waterloo, through St. Helena. In 2.5H, even with the right actor who has engaging charisma and charm, it's too much ground. No character development whatsoever. None. Even in 4H it's like getting two bad suits for the price of one. It's just more of what's bad, which is miscast Phoenix in the titular role. I only understood the movie because I love and know the history. My wife and 86 year old father could not follow it, and my 19 year old daughter (somewhat tired from returning from college) dozed off a couple of times. No one liked the movie. And we even went out of our way to the IMAX because, well, it was Napoleon.I almost forgot to mention the emasculation of Napoleon by Josephine, the jarring politically correct now-required social normalizing casting of extras, and the ending credits that count the dead but give no context for the concomitant social reforms.Braveheart was historically all wrong, but it was still a great story with a wonderful score. This Napoleon is a bad story, and, even if Napoleon was a fictional character it was still bad. It's both a bad reflection of a real man, a grossly incomplete historical depiction, and a bad story poorly told no matter what.Napoleon was loved, hated, admired and ridiculed, by many of the same people, at different times. He was, if nothing else, one of the greatest characters in the recorded history of mankind. To try to do it all fairly, with the wrong titular actor, is silly. Really silly. Delusively silly.Sir Ridley's movie The Last Duel failed for a similar reason, and then he blames the audience. It's not the production or even perhaps the precise movie direction that is going wrong, it's that the story itself is not well-told. Perhaps it's time for him to teach his tactical craft to a young person with the right vision for the story expression.I need to watch my Waterloo DVD again to get my head back to the right flavor of Napoleon the Great, not Napoleon the Whisperer.Nothing good, new or better. A waste of my time and money."
"Napoleon","heisenberg12","23 November 2023",510,"The title says it all. When anyone thinks about Napolean, they automatically think of the general, the egomaniacal conquerer, military genius who glorified and unified France after the French Revolution.So going into an ""epic"" 2 hour and 40 minute movie, you would safely assume we'd get a glimpse into that twisted, genius mind, especially from an actor like Phoenix, right?Wrong. Instead we get practically a two hour, unoriginal portrait of his banal relationship with Josephine; yes, the rest of the 45 minutes are indeed battles that were good, not great. The lopsided focus on Josephine is unwarranted and unjustified, merely because we didn't learn anything new that we couldn't already assume if it only featured a half hour with their relationship on screen. Honestly, I still cannot fathom any point in that narrative decision after enduring it, as again, there were no twists or startling revelations; if the point was to just humanize Napoleon, we get it, he had a wife and dealt with her toxicity.The best part of the entire movie was the very end when the biographical title cards came up and revealed what a bloodlusting monster he really was, with the visceral explanation of the vast amount of lives he lost in his vain conquests. Back then, the world population was exponentially less than today. Three million in less than twenty years over 61 campaigns, with the Russian incursion costing three hundred plus thousand alone, seventy thousand at Waterloo. It's a shame that most of the tone of the movie not only was wasted on his love life, but moreso did not depict him as the maniacal sociopath he clearly was.On a side note, since we're delving into European French history and this piece failed to capture the period well enough, future filmmakers should hone in on the actual French Revolution. Tale of Two Cities, anyone? Nolan would crush it!4.5/10."
"Napoleon","malmevik77","25 November 2023",210,"NapoleonLet's start with the good things. The battle scenes are well shot, exciting, horrifying, the excellent work one can expect from a Ridley Scott movie.Josephine was fantastic. Her situation was clearly not ideal, and the actress portrayed her in such a way that I felt more for her than anyone else in the film.Now the bad things. All of it. This movie was not good at all. It was such a disappointment. This film had major problems with the flow of the story. It was extremely disjointed. I had no understanding of what was happening as it felt like someone took an outline and only filmed the bullet points, and not the detail beneath it. There is no transition from the coup in 1799 to the coronation in 1804. There is no explanation. There is no context as to how and why this was even acceptable.And don't get me started on historical inaccuracies. The very first scene shows Marie Antoinette getting beheaded in 1789 when that amazing invention called google can tell you otherwise.Maybe I'm being a bit harsh but I've studied English and French history quite extensively and it was cringe worthy to watch. Joaquin Phoenix was also very much miscast. I felt sorry for Vanessa Kirby as she was the highlight of the film. In all honesty, this film should have been called Josephine.I do not recommend watching this unless you're just there for the well shot battle scenes. The lake scene will give you chills. This film was a huge disappointment and I felt embarrassed for the filmmakers."
"Napoleon","itsahoverboard","23 November 2023",510,"Yes, that's a real quote from Joaquin Phoenix to Ridley Scott right before they started filming. I love Joaquin Phoenix, but you can really tell that he doesn't ""get"" the character of Napoleon that he's trying to play. I honestly don't know if Phoenix even has that kind of charisma and confidence within him, but then again I don't know anything about Napoleon either. But it was just uncomfortable watching him stumble his way through the movie, often just looking clueless.The other problem with the movie is it's just plain dull and uninteresting. It really does feel like a ""highlights"" movie. For an almost 3-hour film, it has surprisingly little dialogue. The dialogue that's there isn't' that illuminating or interesting. I normally like politics and romance (which is the bulk of this story), but I would have loved to see more military and war stuff in a movie like this. Isn't Napoleon supposed to be a brilliant war leader? There's like none of that here. Except ""oh we'll do a sneak attack in the night.""The cinematography was also really surprisingly dull. It looked super digital. The colors were so bland and washed out.Vanessa Kirby is really the best thing about the movie. And also the first battle taking over that fort, which was admittedly pretty epic. I have never seen such a thing happen to a horse in a movie, and it was wonderfully horrifying.I fully blame Ridley Scott for this dud. Hopefully Spielberg's Kubrick miniseries about Napoleon will be much better."
"Napoleon","zeki-4","22 November 2023",710,"Back in 2005 Ridley Scott's 144 minute version of 'Kingdom of Heaven' premiered in theatres to somewhat mixed reviews. A couple of years later the vastly superior 190 minute director's cut version finally arrived, with the general consensus that the final product was a masterclass in storytelling, directing, acting and cinematography. - without doubt the best motion picture ever made about the crusades.Almost 20 years later we are yet again treated with a compiled highlight reel of a Ridley Scott movie in the theatre, rather than a full-fledged historical epic, since it has already become official that 'Napoleon' will be released later on streaming with its entire runtime of almost four hours, which clearly is needed to flesh out many parts of the movie and fill in the emotional and historical blanks, because this - somewhat butchered cut - moves in a breakneck speed and feels too rushed.Whereas the underappreciated 1970 movie 'Waterloo' starring Rod Steiger as Napoleon Bonaparte, featuring thousands of extras, portrayed events only during the 100 days campaign in 1815, Scott's 'Napoleon' takes us through decades of various major events and battles beginning with the siege of Toulon in 1793. In this version we never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful. Why did he win the admiration of so many? It's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in real life, but here he is portrayed as a childish brute? It felt like the focus was more on setpieces and his troubled relationship with Josephine, than on him as a ruthless and cunning emperor, and in the theatre cut there really isn't a lot of places where Joaquin Phoenix truly shines as an Oscar contender. Maybe the director's cut will remedy that.In spite of its shortcomings (no pun intended) 'Napoleon' is still one of the best movies I have seen this year, but I am baffled. Because if people can sit through 3+ hour box office hits like 'Avengers Endgame', 'Avatar 2' and 'Oppenheimer' - why the need to release just a very extended trailer of 'Napoleon' in the theatre, especially when everyone know that they can just wait a couple of months for it to arrive on streaming in its entirety? An attempt by Apple at a cash grab? ""You need a subscription to our streaming service to watch the whole thing""?With that being said, I do predict some Oscar nominations here. Ridley Scott yet again proves why he is one of the best filmmakers out there. But a word of caution: If you only plan to see this once, you might consider waiting for the director's cut."
"Napoleon","gcarpiceci","22 November 2023",510,"History is an undesired guest taking the backseat in Mr Scott's sprawling epic on Napoleon's life.Mr Scott's craftsmanship is such that it's undoubtedly able to offer the viewer some unique experiences. But stunning battle visuals and great performances by the lead actors don't make up for gross historical approximation.I have no doubt whatsoever that Mr Scott knows his history and, if he didn't, he surely has a fat staff of assistants to tell it to him; so what he does here (as he did already in Gladiator) is a very deliberate and blatant choice to bend historical reality to the purposes of his own art, which looks like an act of unforgivable artistic hubris."
"Napoleon","richard-1787","27 November 2023",310,"This movie must have cost a fortune to make. (There is no budget listed yet here on IMDB.) You would think they could have spent a little of it on a good script. So many of the problems here stem from the bad script, which does not provide clues about what it going on.What we get is several large-scale but very unexciting battle scenes, where we watch the infantry march into suicidal battle, sometimes led by the cavalry, sometimes followed. In a movie about a fabled tactician, there is no discussion of what made him a success, what he did differently, etc.In between the battle episodes are some of the least romantic, un-erotic love scenes ever filmed. Phoenix and his leading lady have absolutely NO chemistry whatsoever. Half the time he is like a statue with her, the other half like an over-eager dog. We never get a hint of what he might see in her.I stayed through the whole 2.5 hours because I was with friends. Otherwise I would have left mid-way through, or fallen asleep - as Napoleon does several times himself during the battle scenes.I saw Oppenheimer, which is a full three hours long, three times last summer, and was riveted to it all three times. That movie was well directed. This movie didn't hold me at all, had no pacing, and was sometimes confusing even though I have studied that period of French history.Some will find fault with historical inaccuracies. There are evidently a fair number of them. But that doesn't bother me. What bothered me was that Scott and his crew never made this story come alive. Why spend all that money and all those resources on something that just is not interesting?"
"Napoleon","rachelnstephens","22 November 2023",410,"If I knew nothing of Napoleon, I'd be utterly confused about what was happening in this film. There is no hero's journey to follow and nobody to root for.Who is Napoleon? Why is he in France? How did he get to his position? The film begins with the death of Marie Antoinette and pretty much dives right into Napoleon being in charge somehow. Why Napoleon? No idea.Early on we meet Josephine's minor son who is never seen again on screen after a one-on-one meeting with Napoleon. Why does Napoleon meet with him? Why does he grant his request? Why is he interested in Josephine? No idea.The film feels as if you're a time traveller who is moving forward to different snapshots of Napoleon's life. There's little context or explanation. Lots of battle scenes, troop movement, flag signaling and even smelting to make munitions but not a lot of context. Why is Napoleon going here or there? No idea. What is his end goal? No idea. Why do Napoleon's men have an affinity for him? No idea.There are large spans of time between scenes so suddenly Josephine's daughter is a grown adult speaking with Napoleon. No clue who she was until Napoleon mentioned Josephine being her mother. Who are all of these people? No idea. How are they connected? No idea.The film is beautifully shot. The costuming is perfection. The set design is dreamy. Nobody can say that Ridley Scott doesn't know how to make a movie or that Joaquin Phoenix isn't a fantastic actor - it's simply a poor script."
"Napoleon","WadoodS","22 November 2023",510,"Making a movie on a charismatic person like Napoleon is a huge undertaking. It requires in-depth study of his life and then choosing specific events of his life to show and connecting them to perfection. The film maker is short in time therefore it is important for the movie to be precise, fluent and with a purpose. In this movie, the director, Ridley Scott, fails to determine which points of his life he wishes to portray and consequently it results in a piece-by-piece movie which lacks cinematic flow and confuses the audience.The movie disappoints in showing the battles, only briefly does it show the battles of Toulon and Austerlitz and then a bit longer Waterloo, of course concentrating more on Wellington's genius rather than Napoleon's side of things, where there is no mention of Marshal Grouchy's failed mission to block Blucher's army from joining the battle.As great an actor as Joaquin Phoenix is, he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. I felt like Napoleon was intentionally mimicked by the film maker to portray him as a socially awkward person who does not know his way around women, or even his soldiers who loved him so much. During the coup d'etat he is seen as a confused ""coward"" who escapes for his life and is only saved by the cleverness of his brother. But I have personally grown up around military personnel who are calm and composed in the face of adversity and prudently handle critical situations which makes it even more incredible that a military genius of Napoleon's stature would cower under pressure.Joaquin Phoenix's character lacks fundamental personal charisma which is so evident in leaders in general, and military leaders specifically. The movie fails to communicate why then the most civilized, liberal people on the planet earth during that time followed this uncharismatic, bland leader in 61 of his battles? French had already beheaded their king, and all French men were citizens with equal rights - at least only men. No other country in Europe has achieved this level of self-consciousness for human freedom at that time. There is also no mention of his civil, political, artistic achievements like the Code Napoleon or the great artists that flourished under him.Joaquin Phoenix is himself or rather he is still in his Joker character. Apparently, he didn't try enough to get into Napoleon's character. Look at Marlon Brando for example, who shines in his role as Napoleon. Joaquin is so one dimensional who seems to be asleep all the time and has no idea what he is doing while the real Napoleon was an energetic, charismatic, young, and quick individual.I tried to get over his age difference as he is too old to portray such a young person. Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined. He was 35 when he was crowned Emperor of the French. Joaquin Phoenix looks in his fifties in the whole movie. Vanessa Kirby's young age doesn't help much as Josephine was 6 years older. Vanessa Kirby plays brilliantly in her role and dominated every scene she was in as a cold, unfaithful, and then heart-broken queen.It was a brilliant opportunity wasted by the film makers. It could have been much better - as the brilliant life story is already there. The music could have been better. They should have used one of those music/sound directors Christopher Nolan uses in his movies. The cinematography was very good though. The battle scenes were filmed well. My friend pointed out that the cinematographer found his favorite angle on Vaness Kirby when they were in their private bedroom. I laughed more at this joke than at any ""funny"" moments in the movie. Overall, it is a below average movie. Don't go there with your hopes held high. I think Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie. Now I am not sure I will watch the director's cut. I am looking forward to a young, energetic director taking this enterprise and making a Braveheart-like movie."
"Napoleon","M_Exchange","22 November 2023",510,"As many of you know, Stanley Kubrick was obsessed with Napoleon, and he wanted to make his magnum opus about him near the end of his life. He never got around to it. I would have loved to have seen that film.This film is not a total disappointment, but it's far from great. I fell in love with its visuals, and I felt as if I was in the era of the 1790's/early 1800's. Its war scenes are good. Also, I appreciate that it does not hit the three hour mark, but it felt choppy and often incomplete. For instance, when Napoleon got punished a couple of times for his defeats one might think that he cut straight from a loss to a meeting with foreign dignitaries. In actuality, things were much messier in between.I never really felt a romantic spark between him and his first wife, and I never really felt much emotion ever throughout the entirety of the film. Even his death was rather anticlimactic and weak.I would recommend this film only to French people and history buffs."
"Napoleon","dorMancyx","22 November 2023",610,"I feel unsatisfied walking out of that theater after three hours of melancholy and confusion. I understand every single word and every single scene, but when they connect into a whole film I don't understand anything. To start off, the costume/production design, naturalistic sceneries, the two meticulously-depicted ancient warfares --- one amid the doleful squall of Austerlitz and another atop the dampened prairie of Waterloo --- and all other technical stuff are spotless. However, there's an anxiety-inducing problem with the narrative --- the movie has no focus. No climax, no resonating themes like Oppenheimer, just one plain, linear, chronological plot; and even that we get multiple baffling time jumps throughout. The plot is so simple that everything in the film was taught in my AP World History class last year in one day, except it nibbles on some superficial details. Highlighting the relationship between Napolean and Josephine is a unique take, and I do see efforts from the two esteemed performers to capture their mutual toxicity and intricacy, but this love story has barely anything to do with the movie's main arc, Napolean's personal rise and fall. Nothing! Two basically unrelated storylines unfolding in the most bland way possible. Also adding to this insipid mess is the score, which is composed primarily of classical or really old-sounding French folk --- what happened to Radiohead from the trailer? God Ridley I don't wanna say three hours of my life is wasted but it kinda is!I didn't think it was possible but, I think Oppenheimer's winning the Oscar."
"Napoleon","theRetiree","22 November 2023",410,"Just came from a full theater. At the end we got up and left in dead silence. No plot except broad strokes of history, little dialog, no passion, Phoenix seemed catatonic, and the movie was nothing more than set pieces posed to look like romantic paintings by Jacques-Louis David (who actually conveyed more emotion and spirit ). The early climax was Austerlitz, which Scott tried to stage as a replay of the destruction of the Teutonic Knights in Alexander.Nevsky. Wikipedia says maybe two of three soldiers (of thousands of casualties) died in the frozen ponds.Waterloo was equally lame, with French cavalry trying unsuccessfully to break the British Squares looking ridiculously like Plains Indians riding in circles attacking a wagon train. (Mel Brooks staged that better.) And Blucher's timely last minute arrival (which Wellington described as a ""near run thing"") had no tension and no suspense.Beautiful costumes and sets, a case of thousands, but unsatisfying either as historical spectacle or grand love affair, with Phoenix and the director both giving new meaning to the expression ""phoning it in."""
"Napoleon","jozenerd","26 November 2023",310,"During this movie, I just felt like watching a Monty Python's version of Napoleon or a BBC special based on a flyer they took on a train station about Napoleon's affairs and life troubles. Once again, Scott is making out his version of the history or the history that goes with his religion and political views. About Joaquin Phoenix's acting, it's sometimes laughable ala Eddie Redmayne on Jupiter Ascending, Halle Berry on Catwoman, or Marion Cotillard's death scene on Batman, that bad!!! Gosh, this movie is a reminder of past glories that are far gone and Mr. Scott is not deceiving me once again. He did it once with Covenant, guess who did it again? Not Britney!"
"Napoleon","nlcckc","23 November 2023",210,"So here is a film about one of the greatest warlords of history, and what do you suppose it emphasizes? If your guess is the yucky ""relationship"" he had with Josephine, you're not far from the truth.Here's what this movie contains:

"Napoleon","OwneyH","23 November 2023",110,"This was one of the worst big budget movies I have ever seen. I made it toward the later half of the movie and everyone had already walked out, I decided to also walk out. It was the first film I ever walked out on. Here is why:Napoleon opens with what is seemingly going to be a historical biography film adaptation of Napoleon's life, what you instead get is a poorly made, half attempt at a comedy. That's not an exaggeration, it really does play out like a half attempted comedy that's neither funny nor entertaining.It starts in the French Revolution, the first problems was Joaquin Phoenix. I never thought he was a bad actor, but he's bad in this movie. Not only is he a bad Napoleon, not only is he way older looking than actual Napoleon (who is supposed to be 24 at the start of the film), but it's like he didn't even wanna play the role. I don't know what he was going for here but what we got is a bumbling fool with no confidence in any regard, no sign of intelligence, no backstory, no character development, no knowledge of his life outside of his marriage, and above all no historical accuracy whatsoever.This isn't only Joaquin Phoenix's fault, it's Ridley Scott and writer David Scarpa too. Everyone failed this project.If what you were looking for is a film about the Napoleonic Wars, look elsewhere. There is almost no war in it, and what little war there was, is only little clips of warfare, and then straight back to Napoleon's marriage life. Even if you found the marriage stuff interesting about Napoleon, this still isn't the movie for you, because it's not accurate and the film makes it's point early on, but for some reason they keep going over the same ground already covered about Napoleon's love life. It get's very repetitive and quite frankly, boring.These clips of combat we get are completely disconnected from the story, it looks like it's randomly thrown in. They're also really short. If you remember, the trailer has combat in Egypt. You see all that combat in the trailer, that's it. There's no more of it. The trailer was better than the movie.As a history buff (especially history on the French Revolution/Napoleonic Wars) and a film buff, it comes off as offensive to the entire subject matter it's covering in history, offensive to the entire art form of filmmaking, and offensive to the intelligence of it's viewer.It takes nothing seriously, all these huge events regardless of your opinion is treated with disrespect.But most historical events are absent from this film. It focuses so heavily on this marriage story that you don't care about it because the film never tried to make you care, to the point where you feel shocked to see how much time has passed and how many events they skipped when you finally see a date pop up on the screen or an actual recognizable event.Or if you don't know Napoleonic history, you will be entirely lost as to what's happening because it explains nothing, it doesn't even mention why the Napoleonic Wars is happening at all. It doesn't even cover Napoleon growing as a general. Or even growing as a person. The look of Napoleon is even lazily done in this.This version of Napoleon is such a fool instead of a smart general, he makes Napoleon Dynamite look like a cool, collected, Chad.From a film making perspective, the movie is horribly made, generic to bad camera work, a bland soundtrack, HORRIBLE writing, a plot that goes nowhere.The only positives I can find is that some of the costume design is good, the sets are pretty well made, and the one scene in the trailer with the ice was cool. But I'd say watch the trailer again instead of the movie. But that's it. Those are the only good things.If you like Napoleon you won't like this, if you hate Napoleon you won't like this. If you like history you won't like this. If you don't care about history you won't like this. It's poorly made and boring for all. Find any other Napoleon focused movie and I'm sure it will be more entertaining.The trailer makes it seem like a different movie. I feel scammed, I feel lied to.A history film about the Napoleonic Wars with no history, no Napoleonic Wars, and an inaccurate Napoleon that's not fun to watch and at times straight up cringe to witness, makes this movie a solid 1. No entertainment value."
"Napoleon","gmznffvs","22 November 2023",310,"Napoleon is one of the greatest characters in history. He came out of the ashes of the French Revolution to not only lead the country but to inspire it. People were given new hope, aspirations and above all opportunities.Bonaparte created the first meritocracy in Europe. Ordinary people rose to positions of significance in the arts, sciences and all walks of life. In his army almost all the generals came from ordinary backgrounds, whereas pre the Revolution they were aristos.Not one person who doesn't know about Napoleon will know any of this when they come out of the movie.There is nothing to give an insight to his motivation Hint, it wasn't all for Josephine. There was no politics. None of the brilliant generals who fought with him get a look in. Bernadot was invited to be king of Sweden! Talleyrand was a self serving rat, but here is a nobody.Even the election of his brothers to the thrones of other European countries is not worth a mention.Napoleon enjoyed his power. Phoenix mopes about with his usual stone face making every day seem a chore.The only good part, worth the three stars is Waterloo, which is a good battle scene, if not by any means perfect, but watching the move from line to square was satisfying.Now people will think this morose dull man was Napoleon. How could he have been? Why would the French have loved him? Why would they welcome him back.What a disappointment."
"Napoleon","imseeg","23 November 2023",610,"A word of warning for those expecting another Gladiator or non stop action spectacle. It is not. Truly not...The bad: director Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes look slick and impressive (and he does an excellent job again), but he is also known for being quite average at making a drama. And this movie tries (and partly fails) to combine action and drama and somehow ends up being neither one. THAT is one of the reasons I'll only rate it with 6 stars.More bad: this story has a weak ""dramatic"" middle (love story) part, which is kinda tedious. And that brings me to a storyline complaint, namely that this story is all over the place. They cram SO much events and history and different characters from different time periods into this one movie that it kinda confused and numbed me down, instead of thrilling me, as an epic should do.This movie was made for Apple streaming (release date january 2024) in the first place, but they made a shorter (butchered) version for the cinemas in order to be able to compete for the Oscars, which demands that a movie must have run in the cinemas for a couple of weeks. No cinema version, no Oscars.The original Apple streaming version lasted some 2 hours longer. Nobody is gonna sit in the cinema for over 4 hours, hence they cut this movie up and now it feels somewhat rushed, confusing and disjointed at certain moments.Not any good then? Joaquin Phoenix is the one redeeming feature. He nails it.. He makes Napoleon look like a complete joke of a man and I love Joaquin Phoenix' performance, but that unfortunately didnt compensate for the other actors being just about average and with little actor's chemistry between them.I had been warned beforehand by friends that this wasnt the spectacle or epic drama they were hoping for and unfortunately they were right. Certainly not a terrible movie, but one that is just about average.Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb."
"Napoleon","petra_ste","3 December 2023",610,"Ridley Scott directed one of the best movies ever made set during the Napoleonic Wars: unfortunately, that movie is not Napoleon but his cinematic debut, The Duellists, forty years ago.Unsurprisingly, The Duellists had a strong source material (it was based on a novel by Joseph Conrad which it often followed almost verbatim), while Napoleon has an uneven screenplay by David Scarpa.Even past the age of eighty Sir Ridley can still shoot pretty and energetic pictures but his hits and misses depend on the scripts he picks, and he hasn't always shown the best discernment.The elephant in the room is the large amount of historical inaccuracies. Even as a history buff I can forgive many of those: cutting or simplifying events for the sake of narrative, or even some overdramatization like the meeting between Napoleon and Wellington (it never happened) or Napoleon being present at Marie Antoinette's execution (he wasn't); however, stuff like Napoleon charging with his troops at Waterloo is absolute cringe, a kid's (or a lout's) idea of history.Still, the big problems here are characterization and pacing.The movie is a demythologization (some would say emasculation) of Napoleon. If you want to take this route then fair enough, but the character here fails to be consistent. I can buy a Napoleon who is an egomaniac and an overrated tactician (like in Tolstoy's War and Peace). I do not buy one who is an anxious, insecure, uncharismatic cold fish but also a stern tactical genius and an effective leader of men, one who flees from Egypt because Josephine is unfaithful but is also an unflappable military mastermind.Phoenix is a great actor and does what he can but the two sides of the character just don't gel with each other. You can't have parodic moments like Napoleon rolling down the stairs during his coup against the Directory, despondently pouting as he waits for the rain to stop at Waterloo or awkwardly climbing on a box to stand face to face with a pharaoh's mummy (with his diminutive stature becoming a not-too-subtle metaphor of his overall mediocrity)... AND THEN have him magnetically charm the French soldiers into obedience after the Elba. This gawky Napoleon would have been shot to pieces there.The other problem is pacing. A single movie about the whole life of Napoleon is in itself absurd, like making ""a movie about World War 2"". There is material in Napoleon's life for a VERY dense miniseries (which Steven Spielberg is reportedly planning).Napoleon's first wife Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) plays a huge role here but I would argue the movie has either too little or way too much of her. This needed to be either focused mostly on Napoleon's personal life or to drastically reduce the (fairly repetitive after a while) moments where Napoleon is obsessed with his wife.As it is now, it tries to tell - but rushes through - twenty very eventful years of European history and yet devotes more time to Napoleon visiting Josephine after their divorce than to his Russian campaign.It's like making a D-Day movie which keeps cutting back and forth from the Normandy landings to Hitler spending time with Eva Braun. You can have either The Longest Day or Der Untergang, not both.Still, it's not worthless. There are some interesting moments and set-pieces and, while Phoenix is saddled with a contradictory character, Kirby at least is excellent.6/10."
"Napoleon","MissSimonetta","25 November 2023",210,"Ridley Scott's NAPOLEON feels like the highlight reel of a lengthy miniseries. Considering there's a 4-hour cut of this film, that explains it all.NAPOLEON is certainly good spectacle. The battle scenes are breathtaking. Unfortunately, it's also shallow. I know Scott has sneered at viewers criticizing the historical inaccuracies in the film, but I'm more bothered by a total lack of interesting character psychology or even coherent storytelling. Characters pop in and out, leaving little impression in their brief scenes. Relationships between characters are barely fleshed out, including that of Napoleon and Josephine, which dominates the running time. Also, potentially unpopular opinion, I thought Joaquin Phoenix's performance was a one-note bore.Perhaps the 4-hour version is a richer piece of work. As is, NAPOLEON is a let down, especially after Scott's brilliant 2021 period piece THE LAST DUEL, which had all the drama and psychological depth this movie lacked."
"Napoleon","dhunjiwadia","26 November 2023",510,"Ridley Scott's Napoleon is more hysterical than historical. History is like an uninvited guest in this movie. Stunning battle visuals don't make up for gross historical approximations.If you want to watch a masterpiece then see Waterloo, with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. And if you want a historical enumeration then watch the Napoleon series with Christian Clavier, Isabella Rossalini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu.This movie was made for Apple streaming. Then they made a butchered version for cinema to be able to compete for the Oscars. The original Apple streaming version will be at least 2 hours longer. This cut version for cinema is somewhat rushed, disjointed and, as a result, confusing.We never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful and won the admiration of so many. Here it's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in reality, over here he's shown as a childish brute. The focus was more on set pieces and his relationship with Josephine.Joaquin Phoenix can play odd or troubled characters well. Here he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. He's too old for this role (Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined) and made the character seem bizarre than a charismatic leader. Vanessa Kirby as Josephine gets more traction.The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is of a very high order. The battle scenes are filmed well. Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes slick and impressive. But overall it's a below average movie. Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie."
"Napoleon","krzysiektom","26 November 2023",210,"What a disappointment. This film is BORING. A movie with a huge budget, good actors, about a person as fascinating and complex as Bonaparte, who participated in more than 60 battles and had drama, triumphs and failures that would be enough for a few lifetimes, is... BORING! Nothing is well explained, it's unclear who is who beside Napoleon and Josephine. Several unnecessary sex scenes between the two. What's even worse is that it's unclear why the French nation would follow and worship this Napoleon as he's portrayed in this movie, because in this movie he seems a mediocre personality, without much charisma or extraordinary abilities. In addition, everything on the screen looks greyish blue, without vivid colors, and it is a bit depressing. I liked only two elements of this movie: musical score and costumes."
"Napoleon","levybob","2 December 2023",410,"I read the reviews of Ridley Scott's 'Napoleon' and knew it was not the great film everyone anticipated. Even so, I went. And what I discovered is that it's bad in the worst kind of way; It is dull. Lifeless. A flat un-involving story about characters who are in every way unlikable. Another reviewer wrote that he / she had trouble staying awake through its 2 hours 40 minutes run-time. When I read that I laughed. Now that I have seen the film, I am laughing no longer.Napoleon Bonaparte as Emperor of France did a lot of good things; much of the country's 'Civil Code' was instituted during his reign. But this film deals only with (a) Napoleon the warrior and (b) Napoleon the husband, and fails to deliver a well-rounded character in either sense. We know he loves France but aside from living there we don't know what drives his passion. His hatred for anything not France is clear, but the reasons for this hatred are never explained. There are battles a'plenty but the reason for them is elusive. Enemies become friends. Friends become enemies. We care about none of them. Thousands die. Somehow we care nothing about them either.There is, in Napoleon, no one to root for. Making matters worse there is an uneven performance by Joaquin Phoenix. His 'later' Napoleon becomes a different character than we'd seen earlier in the film. And no, I don't think it is attributed to Napoleon's rise in power. I think it's Phoenix; his acting, his portrayal. His Napoleon is far less quirky as the film progresses (as though the actor wants out of his role), and in this way, he is far less interesting.If there's anyone about whom we do care that character would be Josephine, Napoleon's wife and Empress of France. Vanessa Kirby is ravishing in the role. A rare beauty but one with a shadow-filled past as well as future. We can understand Napoleon's undying love her but the truth is, she's not the nicest girl on the block. There's little doubt that Mr. Bonaparte would never have 'won' her, were he not the country's future leader. So, again, no one to truly root for.Ah, yes. The battle scenes. They're fine (though it seems as though a battle fought at the base of Egypt's pyramids was cut out). But I think fewer battles and more unraveling of the reasons behind those battles between France, England, Russia, Austria, and other countries might make the remaining battles more meaningful.More involving.Which, as I said, this film is definitely not."
"Napoleon","Eleatic67","2 March 2024",610,"The success of any film depends mostly on the script. Why Scott would initiate such an expensive project without ensuring a refined and sophisticated script is a mystery. I'm not convinced there is a single interesting scene that provides insight into the characters or captures through language the prevailing political ideas. Scott's frequent missteps as a director reflect a greater interest in the cinematic rather than in the dramatic. However, this seems inevitable when your priority is delivering a blockbuster that will have broad appeal instead of digging deeper into culture, society, or history. A colossal waste of an extraordinary opportunity to create an important film about a fascinating historical figure."
"Napoleon","Vic_max","22 November 2023",610,"Many of Ridley Scott's movies are like visual masterpieces with epic storylines. I was sort of expecting something like Gladiator. Instead, it was just ""meh"" - I probably would have quit watching if it was on TV.Joaquin Phoenix has demonstrated that he can play odd or troubled characters well, but I don't think he was a good choice for Napoleon. He made the character seem more bizarre than charismatic or leader-like. I think the strongest and most interesting character was actually Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) ... who will probably get the most traction from the movie.The story itself wasn't that interesting because it wasn't explained that well. For example, his departure from Elba island seemed to randomly happen without much explanation. The elevation to a monarch-like role also happens without much explanation. It's like you're watching snippets of a bigger, more interesting story.I become so disconnected from the story that I almost fell asleep during some of the long battle sequences.The movie would probably have been better if it captured just one pivotal event or time period ... or better yet, if it had been a miniseries. While I will still look forward to any future movie from Scott, Napoleon deserved better."
"Napoleon","epicking","23 November 2023",310,"Im only focused on the historical aspect here ... and I only mentions a couple of out many hereIn the beginning, Napoleon abandons a battle at the Egyptian pyramids because Joséphine is unfaithful at home in Paris. It is pure fiction.Much later, when the two have divorced, he marches on Paris from his famous exile on the island of Elba, because he is jealous that the Russian Tsar Alexander is apparently taking a swing with Joséphine. From whom Napoleon, by the way, has long since divorced.It is a distortion of history of the worst kind. Joséphine dies of pneumonia in 1814. Napoleon first marches on Paris in 1815 to regain power, a wild story that could be a whole movie in itself.If you´re gonna make an expensive movie like this, get things right instead of just making romantic stuff up."
"Napoleon","LongTimeMovieLover","23 November 2023",410,"First, let me get this out of the way. If you want to watch a focused masterpiece, watch Waterloo with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. It could have only been better (for me) if Steiger had a French accent. Second, if you want to watch a general scoping history of Napoleon, consider the excellent and approachable Napoleon series with Christian Clavier (with a French accent), Isabella Rossallini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu. (Clavier is sometimes unfairly maligned when indeed he does a splendid job in my view.) There are other well-reputed less approachable versions, but these two are excellent.Now, as this work, let's start with Napoleon. A boyishly handsome, philosophically grounded (Napoleonic Code), egotistical, pugnacious genius, sometimes brooding sometimes loving, sometimes playing. That is, a strategically gifted, tactically trained, boyishly handsome, egotistical, passionate, lovable, fighting, moody, young genius.I am sorry, but this character requires someone like a young Brando or Pacino. Phoenix simply cannot, no-way, pull it off. Way wrong. Crazy wrong. He does not have the range. He is a great actor only in a particular type of role, a crouching villainous Caesar or a depressive Joker. A melancholic low-key whispering introverted Napoleon does not work, and some form of delusion by Scott allowed or put Phoenix into this role. I can easily get past failure of boyish good looks and the way wrong age (and Napoleon's young age is part of the story itself). But I cannot get past whispering tone and failure of charisma, passion and charm. Napoleon seduced a lot of people in a lot of ways.It's not Phoenix's fault he was miscast. Way miscast. Vanessa Kirby was fine and did her job. But, no one in this movie deserves any acting nominations. Take one common scene, being the ""Will you shoot your emperor?"" following Napoleon's escape from Elba and return to France, the other referenced Napoleons had timing, tension, and drama, here blah, nothing. Nothing! It's just bad. Really bad.Nothing in this movie taught me anything, made me think, made me feel, or moved me in any way. Terribly unengaging. Even the couple attempts at comic relief (if there would have been any tension, which was devoid) it was misplaced and failed miserably.Now, let's talk about the versions. This is the 2.5H version and there is another 4H version to be released by Apple+. Everything is a gimmick these days. Every streaming channel has one gem, but I'll suggest this work is inherently flawed by miscast Phoenix and more time to blend the scenes won't do it. In this 2.5H version, it's like a bunch of scenes without any context. We go from the French Revolution through the Reign of Terror through Napoleon's coup through Austerlitz through first defeat through Elba through return to France through Waterloo, through St. Helena. In 2.5H, even with the right actor who has engaging charisma and charm, it's too much ground. No character development whatsoever. None. Even in 4H it's like getting two bad suits for the price of one. It's just more of what's bad, which is miscast Phoenix in the titular role. I only understood the movie because I love and know the history. My wife and 86 year old father could not follow it, and my 19 year old daughter (somewhat tired from returning from college) dozed off a couple of times. No one liked the movie. And we even went out of our way to the IMAX because, well, it was Napoleon.I almost forgot to mention the emasculation of Napoleon by Josephine, the jarring politically correct now-required social normalizing casting of extras, and the ending credits that count the dead but give no context for the concomitant social reforms.Braveheart was historically all wrong, but it was still a great story with a wonderful score. This Napoleon is a bad story, and, even if Napoleon was a fictional character it was still bad. It's both a bad reflection of a real man, a grossly incomplete historical depiction, and a bad story poorly told no matter what.Napoleon was loved, hated, admired and ridiculed, by many of the same people, at different times. He was, if nothing else, one of the greatest characters in the recorded history of mankind. To try to do it all fairly, with the wrong titular actor, is silly. Really silly. Delusively silly.Sir Ridley's movie The Last Duel failed for a similar reason, and then he blames the audience. It's not the production or even perhaps the precise movie direction that is going wrong, it's that the story itself is not well-told. Perhaps it's time for him to teach his tactical craft to a young person with the right vision for the story expression.I need to watch my Waterloo DVD again to get my head back to the right flavor of Napoleon the Great, not Napoleon the Whisperer.Nothing good, new or better. A waste of my time and money."
"Napoleon","heisenberg12","23 November 2023",510,"The title says it all. When anyone thinks about Napolean, they automatically think of the general, the egomaniacal conquerer, military genius who glorified and unified France after the French Revolution.So going into an ""epic"" 2 hour and 40 minute movie, you would safely assume we'd get a glimpse into that twisted, genius mind, especially from an actor like Phoenix, right?Wrong. Instead we get practically a two hour, unoriginal portrait of his banal relationship with Josephine; yes, the rest of the 45 minutes are indeed battles that were good, not great. The lopsided focus on Josephine is unwarranted and unjustified, merely because we didn't learn anything new that we couldn't already assume if it only featured a half hour with their relationship on screen. Honestly, I still cannot fathom any point in that narrative decision after enduring it, as again, there were no twists or startling revelations; if the point was to just humanize Napoleon, we get it, he had a wife and dealt with her toxicity.The best part of the entire movie was the very end when the biographical title cards came up and revealed what a bloodlusting monster he really was, with the visceral explanation of the vast amount of lives he lost in his vain conquests. Back then, the world population was exponentially less than today. Three million in less than twenty years over 61 campaigns, with the Russian incursion costing three hundred plus thousand alone, seventy thousand at Waterloo. It's a shame that most of the tone of the movie not only was wasted on his love life, but moreso did not depict him as the maniacal sociopath he clearly was.On a side note, since we're delving into European French history and this piece failed to capture the period well enough, future filmmakers should hone in on the actual French Revolution. Tale of Two Cities, anyone? Nolan would crush it!4.5/10."
"Napoleon","malmevik77","25 November 2023",210,"NapoleonLet's start with the good things. The battle scenes are well shot, exciting, horrifying, the excellent work one can expect from a Ridley Scott movie.Josephine was fantastic. Her situation was clearly not ideal, and the actress portrayed her in such a way that I felt more for her than anyone else in the film.Now the bad things. All of it. This movie was not good at all. It was such a disappointment. This film had major problems with the flow of the story. It was extremely disjointed. I had no understanding of what was happening as it felt like someone took an outline and only filmed the bullet points, and not the detail beneath it. There is no transition from the coup in 1799 to the coronation in 1804. There is no explanation. There is no context as to how and why this was even acceptable.And don't get me started on historical inaccuracies. The very first scene shows Marie Antoinette getting beheaded in 1789 when that amazing invention called google can tell you otherwise.Maybe I'm being a bit harsh but I've studied English and French history quite extensively and it was cringe worthy to watch. Joaquin Phoenix was also very much miscast. I felt sorry for Vanessa Kirby as she was the highlight of the film. In all honesty, this film should have been called Josephine.I do not recommend watching this unless you're just there for the well shot battle scenes. The lake scene will give you chills. This film was a huge disappointment and I felt embarrassed for the filmmakers."
"Napoleon","itsahoverboard","23 November 2023",510,"Yes, that's a real quote from Joaquin Phoenix to Ridley Scott right before they started filming. I love Joaquin Phoenix, but you can really tell that he doesn't ""get"" the character of Napoleon that he's trying to play. I honestly don't know if Phoenix even has that kind of charisma and confidence within him, but then again I don't know anything about Napoleon either. But it was just uncomfortable watching him stumble his way through the movie, often just looking clueless.The other problem with the movie is it's just plain dull and uninteresting. It really does feel like a ""highlights"" movie. For an almost 3-hour film, it has surprisingly little dialogue. The dialogue that's there isn't' that illuminating or interesting. I normally like politics and romance (which is the bulk of this story), but I would have loved to see more military and war stuff in a movie like this. Isn't Napoleon supposed to be a brilliant war leader? There's like none of that here. Except ""oh we'll do a sneak attack in the night.""The cinematography was also really surprisingly dull. It looked super digital. The colors were so bland and washed out.Vanessa Kirby is really the best thing about the movie. And also the first battle taking over that fort, which was admittedly pretty epic. I have never seen such a thing happen to a horse in a movie, and it was wonderfully horrifying.I fully blame Ridley Scott for this dud. Hopefully Spielberg's Kubrick miniseries about Napoleon will be much better."
"Napoleon","zeki-4","22 November 2023",710,"Back in 2005 Ridley Scott's 144 minute version of 'Kingdom of Heaven' premiered in theatres to somewhat mixed reviews. A couple of years later the vastly superior 190 minute director's cut version finally arrived, with the general consensus that the final product was a masterclass in storytelling, directing, acting and cinematography. - without doubt the best motion picture ever made about the crusades.Almost 20 years later we are yet again treated with a compiled highlight reel of a Ridley Scott movie in the theatre, rather than a full-fledged historical epic, since it has already become official that 'Napoleon' will be released later on streaming with its entire runtime of almost four hours, which clearly is needed to flesh out many parts of the movie and fill in the emotional and historical blanks, because this - somewhat butchered cut - moves in a breakneck speed and feels too rushed.Whereas the underappreciated 1970 movie 'Waterloo' starring Rod Steiger as Napoleon Bonaparte, featuring thousands of extras, portrayed events only during the 100 days campaign in 1815, Scott's 'Napoleon' takes us through decades of various major events and battles beginning with the siege of Toulon in 1793. In this version we never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful. Why did he win the admiration of so many? It's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in real life, but here he is portrayed as a childish brute? It felt like the focus was more on setpieces and his troubled relationship with Josephine, than on him as a ruthless and cunning emperor, and in the theatre cut there really isn't a lot of places where Joaquin Phoenix truly shines as an Oscar contender. Maybe the director's cut will remedy that.In spite of its shortcomings (no pun intended) 'Napoleon' is still one of the best movies I have seen this year, but I am baffled. Because if people can sit through 3+ hour box office hits like 'Avengers Endgame', 'Avatar 2' and 'Oppenheimer' - why the need to release just a very extended trailer of 'Napoleon' in the theatre, especially when everyone know that they can just wait a couple of months for it to arrive on streaming in its entirety? An attempt by Apple at a cash grab? ""You need a subscription to our streaming service to watch the whole thing""?With that being said, I do predict some Oscar nominations here. Ridley Scott yet again proves why he is one of the best filmmakers out there. But a word of caution: If you only plan to see this once, you might consider waiting for the director's cut."
"Napoleon","gcarpiceci","22 November 2023",510,"History is an undesired guest taking the backseat in Mr Scott's sprawling epic on Napoleon's life.Mr Scott's craftsmanship is such that it's undoubtedly able to offer the viewer some unique experiences. But stunning battle visuals and great performances by the lead actors don't make up for gross historical approximation.I have no doubt whatsoever that Mr Scott knows his history and, if he didn't, he surely has a fat staff of assistants to tell it to him; so what he does here (as he did already in Gladiator) is a very deliberate and blatant choice to bend historical reality to the purposes of his own art, which looks like an act of unforgivable artistic hubris."
"Napoleon","richard-1787","27 November 2023",310,"This movie must have cost a fortune to make. (There is no budget listed yet here on IMDB.) You would think they could have spent a little of it on a good script. So many of the problems here stem from the bad script, which does not provide clues about what it going on.What we get is several large-scale but very unexciting battle scenes, where we watch the infantry march into suicidal battle, sometimes led by the cavalry, sometimes followed. In a movie about a fabled tactician, there is no discussion of what made him a success, what he did differently, etc.In between the battle episodes are some of the least romantic, un-erotic love scenes ever filmed. Phoenix and his leading lady have absolutely NO chemistry whatsoever. Half the time he is like a statue with her, the other half like an over-eager dog. We never get a hint of what he might see in her.I stayed through the whole 2.5 hours because I was with friends. Otherwise I would have left mid-way through, or fallen asleep - as Napoleon does several times himself during the battle scenes.I saw Oppenheimer, which is a full three hours long, three times last summer, and was riveted to it all three times. That movie was well directed. This movie didn't hold me at all, had no pacing, and was sometimes confusing even though I have studied that period of French history.Some will find fault with historical inaccuracies. There are evidently a fair number of them. But that doesn't bother me. What bothered me was that Scott and his crew never made this story come alive. Why spend all that money and all those resources on something that just is not interesting?"
"Napoleon","rachelnstephens","22 November 2023",410,"If I knew nothing of Napoleon, I'd be utterly confused about what was happening in this film. There is no hero's journey to follow and nobody to root for.Who is Napoleon? Why is he in France? How did he get to his position? The film begins with the death of Marie Antoinette and pretty much dives right into Napoleon being in charge somehow. Why Napoleon? No idea.Early on we meet Josephine's minor son who is never seen again on screen after a one-on-one meeting with Napoleon. Why does Napoleon meet with him? Why does he grant his request? Why is he interested in Josephine? No idea.The film feels as if you're a time traveller who is moving forward to different snapshots of Napoleon's life. There's little context or explanation. Lots of battle scenes, troop movement, flag signaling and even smelting to make munitions but not a lot of context. Why is Napoleon going here or there? No idea. What is his end goal? No idea. Why do Napoleon's men have an affinity for him? No idea.There are large spans of time between scenes so suddenly Josephine's daughter is a grown adult speaking with Napoleon. No clue who she was until Napoleon mentioned Josephine being her mother. Who are all of these people? No idea. How are they connected? No idea.The film is beautifully shot. The costuming is perfection. The set design is dreamy. Nobody can say that Ridley Scott doesn't know how to make a movie or that Joaquin Phoenix isn't a fantastic actor - it's simply a poor script."
"Napoleon","WadoodS","22 November 2023",510,"Making a movie on a charismatic person like Napoleon is a huge undertaking. It requires in-depth study of his life and then choosing specific events of his life to show and connecting them to perfection. The film maker is short in time therefore it is important for the movie to be precise, fluent and with a purpose. In this movie, the director, Ridley Scott, fails to determine which points of his life he wishes to portray and consequently it results in a piece-by-piece movie which lacks cinematic flow and confuses the audience.The movie disappoints in showing the battles, only briefly does it show the battles of Toulon and Austerlitz and then a bit longer Waterloo, of course concentrating more on Wellington's genius rather than Napoleon's side of things, where there is no mention of Marshal Grouchy's failed mission to block Blucher's army from joining the battle.As great an actor as Joaquin Phoenix is, he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. I felt like Napoleon was intentionally mimicked by the film maker to portray him as a socially awkward person who does not know his way around women, or even his soldiers who loved him so much. During the coup d'etat he is seen as a confused ""coward"" who escapes for his life and is only saved by the cleverness of his brother. But I have personally grown up around military personnel who are calm and composed in the face of adversity and prudently handle critical situations which makes it even more incredible that a military genius of Napoleon's stature would cower under pressure.Joaquin Phoenix's character lacks fundamental personal charisma which is so evident in leaders in general, and military leaders specifically. The movie fails to communicate why then the most civilized, liberal people on the planet earth during that time followed this uncharismatic, bland leader in 61 of his battles? French had already beheaded their king, and all French men were citizens with equal rights - at least only men. No other country in Europe has achieved this level of self-consciousness for human freedom at that time. There is also no mention of his civil, political, artistic achievements like the Code Napoleon or the great artists that flourished under him.Joaquin Phoenix is himself or rather he is still in his Joker character. Apparently, he didn't try enough to get into Napoleon's character. Look at Marlon Brando for example, who shines in his role as Napoleon. Joaquin is so one dimensional who seems to be asleep all the time and has no idea what he is doing while the real Napoleon was an energetic, charismatic, young, and quick individual.I tried to get over his age difference as he is too old to portray such a young person. Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined. He was 35 when he was crowned Emperor of the French. Joaquin Phoenix looks in his fifties in the whole movie. Vanessa Kirby's young age doesn't help much as Josephine was 6 years older. Vanessa Kirby plays brilliantly in her role and dominated every scene she was in as a cold, unfaithful, and then heart-broken queen.It was a brilliant opportunity wasted by the film makers. It could have been much better - as the brilliant life story is already there. The music could have been better. They should have used one of those music/sound directors Christopher Nolan uses in his movies. The cinematography was very good though. The battle scenes were filmed well. My friend pointed out that the cinematographer found his favorite angle on Vaness Kirby when they were in their private bedroom. I laughed more at this joke than at any ""funny"" moments in the movie. Overall, it is a below average movie. Don't go there with your hopes held high. I think Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie. Now I am not sure I will watch the director's cut. I am looking forward to a young, energetic director taking this enterprise and making a Braveheart-like movie."
"Napoleon","M_Exchange","22 November 2023",510,"As many of you know, Stanley Kubrick was obsessed with Napoleon, and he wanted to make his magnum opus about him near the end of his life. He never got around to it. I would have loved to have seen that film.This film is not a total disappointment, but it's far from great. I fell in love with its visuals, and I felt as if I was in the era of the 1790's/early 1800's. Its war scenes are good. Also, I appreciate that it does not hit the three hour mark, but it felt choppy and often incomplete. For instance, when Napoleon got punished a couple of times for his defeats one might think that he cut straight from a loss to a meeting with foreign dignitaries. In actuality, things were much messier in between.I never really felt a romantic spark between him and his first wife, and I never really felt much emotion ever throughout the entirety of the film. Even his death was rather anticlimactic and weak.I would recommend this film only to French people and history buffs."
"Napoleon","dorMancyx","22 November 2023",610,"I feel unsatisfied walking out of that theater after three hours of melancholy and confusion. I understand every single word and every single scene, but when they connect into a whole film I don't understand anything. To start off, the costume/production design, naturalistic sceneries, the two meticulously-depicted ancient warfares --- one amid the doleful squall of Austerlitz and another atop the dampened prairie of Waterloo --- and all other technical stuff are spotless. However, there's an anxiety-inducing problem with the narrative --- the movie has no focus. No climax, no resonating themes like Oppenheimer, just one plain, linear, chronological plot; and even that we get multiple baffling time jumps throughout. The plot is so simple that everything in the film was taught in my AP World History class last year in one day, except it nibbles on some superficial details. Highlighting the relationship between Napolean and Josephine is a unique take, and I do see efforts from the two esteemed performers to capture their mutual toxicity and intricacy, but this love story has barely anything to do with the movie's main arc, Napolean's personal rise and fall. Nothing! Two basically unrelated storylines unfolding in the most bland way possible. Also adding to this insipid mess is the score, which is composed primarily of classical or really old-sounding French folk --- what happened to Radiohead from the trailer? God Ridley I don't wanna say three hours of my life is wasted but it kinda is!I didn't think it was possible but, I think Oppenheimer's winning the Oscar."
"Napoleon","theRetiree","22 November 2023",410,"Just came from a full theater. At the end we got up and left in dead silence. No plot except broad strokes of history, little dialog, no passion, Phoenix seemed catatonic, and the movie was nothing more than set pieces posed to look like romantic paintings by Jacques-Louis David (who actually conveyed more emotion and spirit ). The early climax was Austerlitz, which Scott tried to stage as a replay of the destruction of the Teutonic Knights in Alexander.Nevsky. Wikipedia says maybe two of three soldiers (of thousands of casualties) died in the frozen ponds.Waterloo was equally lame, with French cavalry trying unsuccessfully to break the British Squares looking ridiculously like Plains Indians riding in circles attacking a wagon train. (Mel Brooks staged that better.) And Blucher's timely last minute arrival (which Wellington described as a ""near run thing"") had no tension and no suspense.Beautiful costumes and sets, a case of thousands, but unsatisfying either as historical spectacle or grand love affair, with Phoenix and the director both giving new meaning to the expression ""phoning it in."""
"Napoleon","jozenerd","26 November 2023",310,"During this movie, I just felt like watching a Monty Python's version of Napoleon or a BBC special based on a flyer they took on a train station about Napoleon's affairs and life troubles. Once again, Scott is making out his version of the history or the history that goes with his religion and political views. About Joaquin Phoenix's acting, it's sometimes laughable ala Eddie Redmayne on Jupiter Ascending, Halle Berry on Catwoman, or Marion Cotillard's death scene on Batman, that bad!!! Gosh, this movie is a reminder of past glories that are far gone and Mr. Scott is not deceiving me once again. He did it once with Covenant, guess who did it again? Not Britney!"
"Napoleon","nlcckc","23 November 2023",210,"So here is a film about one of the greatest warlords of history, and what do you suppose it emphasizes? If your guess is the yucky ""relationship"" he had with Josephine, you're not far from the truth.Here's what this movie contains:

"Napoleon","OwneyH","23 November 2023",110,"This was one of the worst big budget movies I have ever seen. I made it toward the later half of the movie and everyone had already walked out, I decided to also walk out. It was the first film I ever walked out on. Here is why:Napoleon opens with what is seemingly going to be a historical biography film adaptation of Napoleon's life, what you instead get is a poorly made, half attempt at a comedy. That's not an exaggeration, it really does play out like a half attempted comedy that's neither funny nor entertaining.It starts in the French Revolution, the first problems was Joaquin Phoenix. I never thought he was a bad actor, but he's bad in this movie. Not only is he a bad Napoleon, not only is he way older looking than actual Napoleon (who is supposed to be 24 at the start of the film), but it's like he didn't even wanna play the role. I don't know what he was going for here but what we got is a bumbling fool with no confidence in any regard, no sign of intelligence, no backstory, no character development, no knowledge of his life outside of his marriage, and above all no historical accuracy whatsoever.This isn't only Joaquin Phoenix's fault, it's Ridley Scott and writer David Scarpa too. Everyone failed this project.If what you were looking for is a film about the Napoleonic Wars, look elsewhere. There is almost no war in it, and what little war there was, is only little clips of warfare, and then straight back to Napoleon's marriage life. Even if you found the marriage stuff interesting about Napoleon, this still isn't the movie for you, because it's not accurate and the film makes it's point early on, but for some reason they keep going over the same ground already covered about Napoleon's love life. It get's very repetitive and quite frankly, boring.These clips of combat we get are completely disconnected from the story, it looks like it's randomly thrown in. They're also really short. If you remember, the trailer has combat in Egypt. You see all that combat in the trailer, that's it. There's no more of it. The trailer was better than the movie.As a history buff (especially history on the French Revolution/Napoleonic Wars) and a film buff, it comes off as offensive to the entire subject matter it's covering in history, offensive to the entire art form of filmmaking, and offensive to the intelligence of it's viewer.It takes nothing seriously, all these huge events regardless of your opinion is treated with disrespect.But most historical events are absent from this film. It focuses so heavily on this marriage story that you don't care about it because the film never tried to make you care, to the point where you feel shocked to see how much time has passed and how many events they skipped when you finally see a date pop up on the screen or an actual recognizable event.Or if you don't know Napoleonic history, you will be entirely lost as to what's happening because it explains nothing, it doesn't even mention why the Napoleonic Wars is happening at all. It doesn't even cover Napoleon growing as a general. Or even growing as a person. The look of Napoleon is even lazily done in this.This version of Napoleon is such a fool instead of a smart general, he makes Napoleon Dynamite look like a cool, collected, Chad.From a film making perspective, the movie is horribly made, generic to bad camera work, a bland soundtrack, HORRIBLE writing, a plot that goes nowhere.The only positives I can find is that some of the costume design is good, the sets are pretty well made, and the one scene in the trailer with the ice was cool. But I'd say watch the trailer again instead of the movie. But that's it. Those are the only good things.If you like Napoleon you won't like this, if you hate Napoleon you won't like this. If you like history you won't like this. If you don't care about history you won't like this. It's poorly made and boring for all. Find any other Napoleon focused movie and I'm sure it will be more entertaining.The trailer makes it seem like a different movie. I feel scammed, I feel lied to.A history film about the Napoleonic Wars with no history, no Napoleonic Wars, and an inaccurate Napoleon that's not fun to watch and at times straight up cringe to witness, makes this movie a solid 1. No entertainment value."
"Napoleon","gmznffvs","22 November 2023",310,"Napoleon is one of the greatest characters in history. He came out of the ashes of the French Revolution to not only lead the country but to inspire it. People were given new hope, aspirations and above all opportunities.Bonaparte created the first meritocracy in Europe. Ordinary people rose to positions of significance in the arts, sciences and all walks of life. In his army almost all the generals came from ordinary backgrounds, whereas pre the Revolution they were aristos.Not one person who doesn't know about Napoleon will know any of this when they come out of the movie.There is nothing to give an insight to his motivation Hint, it wasn't all for Josephine. There was no politics. None of the brilliant generals who fought with him get a look in. Bernadot was invited to be king of Sweden! Talleyrand was a self serving rat, but here is a nobody.Even the election of his brothers to the thrones of other European countries is not worth a mention.Napoleon enjoyed his power. Phoenix mopes about with his usual stone face making every day seem a chore.The only good part, worth the three stars is Waterloo, which is a good battle scene, if not by any means perfect, but watching the move from line to square was satisfying.Now people will think this morose dull man was Napoleon. How could he have been? Why would the French have loved him? Why would they welcome him back.What a disappointment."
"Napoleon","imseeg","23 November 2023",610,"A word of warning for those expecting another Gladiator or non stop action spectacle. It is not. Truly not...The bad: director Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes look slick and impressive (and he does an excellent job again), but he is also known for being quite average at making a drama. And this movie tries (and partly fails) to combine action and drama and somehow ends up being neither one. THAT is one of the reasons I'll only rate it with 6 stars.More bad: this story has a weak ""dramatic"" middle (love story) part, which is kinda tedious. And that brings me to a storyline complaint, namely that this story is all over the place. They cram SO much events and history and different characters from different time periods into this one movie that it kinda confused and numbed me down, instead of thrilling me, as an epic should do.This movie was made for Apple streaming (release date january 2024) in the first place, but they made a shorter (butchered) version for the cinemas in order to be able to compete for the Oscars, which demands that a movie must have run in the cinemas for a couple of weeks. No cinema version, no Oscars.The original Apple streaming version lasted some 2 hours longer. Nobody is gonna sit in the cinema for over 4 hours, hence they cut this movie up and now it feels somewhat rushed, confusing and disjointed at certain moments.Not any good then? Joaquin Phoenix is the one redeeming feature. He nails it.. He makes Napoleon look like a complete joke of a man and I love Joaquin Phoenix' performance, but that unfortunately didnt compensate for the other actors being just about average and with little actor's chemistry between them.I had been warned beforehand by friends that this wasnt the spectacle or epic drama they were hoping for and unfortunately they were right. Certainly not a terrible movie, but one that is just about average.Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb."
"Napoleon","petra_ste","3 December 2023",610,"Ridley Scott directed one of the best movies ever made set during the Napoleonic Wars: unfortunately, that movie is not Napoleon but his cinematic debut, The Duellists, forty years ago.Unsurprisingly, The Duellists had a strong source material (it was based on a novel by Joseph Conrad which it often followed almost verbatim), while Napoleon has an uneven screenplay by David Scarpa.Even past the age of eighty Sir Ridley can still shoot pretty and energetic pictures but his hits and misses depend on the scripts he picks, and he hasn't always shown the best discernment.The elephant in the room is the large amount of historical inaccuracies. Even as a history buff I can forgive many of those: cutting or simplifying events for the sake of narrative, or even some overdramatization like the meeting between Napoleon and Wellington (it never happened) or Napoleon being present at Marie Antoinette's execution (he wasn't); however, stuff like Napoleon charging with his troops at Waterloo is absolute cringe, a kid's (or a lout's) idea of history.Still, the big problems here are characterization and pacing.The movie is a demythologization (some would say emasculation) of Napoleon. If you want to take this route then fair enough, but the character here fails to be consistent. I can buy a Napoleon who is an egomaniac and an overrated tactician (like in Tolstoy's War and Peace). I do not buy one who is an anxious, insecure, uncharismatic cold fish but also a stern tactical genius and an effective leader of men, one who flees from Egypt because Josephine is unfaithful but is also an unflappable military mastermind.Phoenix is a great actor and does what he can but the two sides of the character just don't gel with each other. You can't have parodic moments like Napoleon rolling down the stairs during his coup against the Directory, despondently pouting as he waits for the rain to stop at Waterloo or awkwardly climbing on a box to stand face to face with a pharaoh's mummy (with his diminutive stature becoming a not-too-subtle metaphor of his overall mediocrity)... AND THEN have him magnetically charm the French soldiers into obedience after the Elba. This gawky Napoleon would have been shot to pieces there.The other problem is pacing. A single movie about the whole life of Napoleon is in itself absurd, like making ""a movie about World War 2"". There is material in Napoleon's life for a VERY dense miniseries (which Steven Spielberg is reportedly planning).Napoleon's first wife Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) plays a huge role here but I would argue the movie has either too little or way too much of her. This needed to be either focused mostly on Napoleon's personal life or to drastically reduce the (fairly repetitive after a while) moments where Napoleon is obsessed with his wife.As it is now, it tries to tell - but rushes through - twenty very eventful years of European history and yet devotes more time to Napoleon visiting Josephine after their divorce than to his Russian campaign.It's like making a D-Day movie which keeps cutting back and forth from the Normandy landings to Hitler spending time with Eva Braun. You can have either The Longest Day or Der Untergang, not both.Still, it's not worthless. There are some interesting moments and set-pieces and, while Phoenix is saddled with a contradictory character, Kirby at least is excellent.6/10."
"Napoleon","MissSimonetta","25 November 2023",210,"Ridley Scott's NAPOLEON feels like the highlight reel of a lengthy miniseries. Considering there's a 4-hour cut of this film, that explains it all.NAPOLEON is certainly good spectacle. The battle scenes are breathtaking. Unfortunately, it's also shallow. I know Scott has sneered at viewers criticizing the historical inaccuracies in the film, but I'm more bothered by a total lack of interesting character psychology or even coherent storytelling. Characters pop in and out, leaving little impression in their brief scenes. Relationships between characters are barely fleshed out, including that of Napoleon and Josephine, which dominates the running time. Also, potentially unpopular opinion, I thought Joaquin Phoenix's performance was a one-note bore.Perhaps the 4-hour version is a richer piece of work. As is, NAPOLEON is a let down, especially after Scott's brilliant 2021 period piece THE LAST DUEL, which had all the drama and psychological depth this movie lacked."
"Napoleon","dhunjiwadia","26 November 2023",510,"Ridley Scott's Napoleon is more hysterical than historical. History is like an uninvited guest in this movie. Stunning battle visuals don't make up for gross historical approximations.If you want to watch a masterpiece then see Waterloo, with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. And if you want a historical enumeration then watch the Napoleon series with Christian Clavier, Isabella Rossalini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu.This movie was made for Apple streaming. Then they made a butchered version for cinema to be able to compete for the Oscars. The original Apple streaming version will be at least 2 hours longer. This cut version for cinema is somewhat rushed, disjointed and, as a result, confusing.We never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful and won the admiration of so many. Here it's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in reality, over here he's shown as a childish brute. The focus was more on set pieces and his relationship with Josephine.Joaquin Phoenix can play odd or troubled characters well. Here he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. He's too old for this role (Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined) and made the character seem bizarre than a charismatic leader. Vanessa Kirby as Josephine gets more traction.The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is of a very high order. The battle scenes are filmed well. Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes slick and impressive. But overall it's a below average movie. Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie."
"Napoleon","krzysiektom","26 November 2023",210,"What a disappointment. This film is BORING. A movie with a huge budget, good actors, about a person as fascinating and complex as Bonaparte, who participated in more than 60 battles and had drama, triumphs and failures that would be enough for a few lifetimes, is... BORING! Nothing is well explained, it's unclear who is who beside Napoleon and Josephine. Several unnecessary sex scenes between the two. What's even worse is that it's unclear why the French nation would follow and worship this Napoleon as he's portrayed in this movie, because in this movie he seems a mediocre personality, without much charisma or extraordinary abilities. In addition, everything on the screen looks greyish blue, without vivid colors, and it is a bit depressing. I liked only two elements of this movie: musical score and costumes."
"Napoleon","levybob","2 December 2023",410,"I read the reviews of Ridley Scott's 'Napoleon' and knew it was not the great film everyone anticipated. Even so, I went. And what I discovered is that it's bad in the worst kind of way; It is dull. Lifeless. A flat un-involving story about characters who are in every way unlikable. Another reviewer wrote that he / she had trouble staying awake through its 2 hours 40 minutes run-time. When I read that I laughed. Now that I have seen the film, I am laughing no longer.Napoleon Bonaparte as Emperor of France did a lot of good things; much of the country's 'Civil Code' was instituted during his reign. But this film deals only with (a) Napoleon the warrior and (b) Napoleon the husband, and fails to deliver a well-rounded character in either sense. We know he loves France but aside from living there we don't know what drives his passion. His hatred for anything not France is clear, but the reasons for this hatred are never explained. There are battles a'plenty but the reason for them is elusive. Enemies become friends. Friends become enemies. We care about none of them. Thousands die. Somehow we care nothing about them either.There is, in Napoleon, no one to root for. Making matters worse there is an uneven performance by Joaquin Phoenix. His 'later' Napoleon becomes a different character than we'd seen earlier in the film. And no, I don't think it is attributed to Napoleon's rise in power. I think it's Phoenix; his acting, his portrayal. His Napoleon is far less quirky as the film progresses (as though the actor wants out of his role), and in this way, he is far less interesting.If there's anyone about whom we do care that character would be Josephine, Napoleon's wife and Empress of France. Vanessa Kirby is ravishing in the role. A rare beauty but one with a shadow-filled past as well as future. We can understand Napoleon's undying love her but the truth is, she's not the nicest girl on the block. There's little doubt that Mr. Bonaparte would never have 'won' her, were he not the country's future leader. So, again, no one to truly root for.Ah, yes. The battle scenes. They're fine (though it seems as though a battle fought at the base of Egypt's pyramids was cut out). But I think fewer battles and more unraveling of the reasons behind those battles between France, England, Russia, Austria, and other countries might make the remaining battles more meaningful.More involving.Which, as I said, this film is definitely not."
"Napoleon","Eleatic67","2 March 2024",610,"The success of any film depends mostly on the script. Why Scott would initiate such an expensive project without ensuring a refined and sophisticated script is a mystery. I'm not convinced there is a single interesting scene that provides insight into the characters or captures through language the prevailing political ideas. Scott's frequent missteps as a director reflect a greater interest in the cinematic rather than in the dramatic. However, this seems inevitable when your priority is delivering a blockbuster that will have broad appeal instead of digging deeper into culture, society, or history. A colossal waste of an extraordinary opportunity to create an important film about a fascinating historical figure."
"Napoleon","Vic_max","22 November 2023",610,"Many of Ridley Scott's movies are like visual masterpieces with epic storylines. I was sort of expecting something like Gladiator. Instead, it was just ""meh"" - I probably would have quit watching if it was on TV.Joaquin Phoenix has demonstrated that he can play odd or troubled characters well, but I don't think he was a good choice for Napoleon. He made the character seem more bizarre than charismatic or leader-like. I think the strongest and most interesting character was actually Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) ... who will probably get the most traction from the movie.The story itself wasn't that interesting because it wasn't explained that well. For example, his departure from Elba island seemed to randomly happen without much explanation. The elevation to a monarch-like role also happens without much explanation. It's like you're watching snippets of a bigger, more interesting story.I become so disconnected from the story that I almost fell asleep during some of the long battle sequences.The movie would probably have been better if it captured just one pivotal event or time period ... or better yet, if it had been a miniseries. While I will still look forward to any future movie from Scott, Napoleon deserved better."
"Napoleon","epicking","23 November 2023",310,"Im only focused on the historical aspect here ... and I only mentions a couple of out many hereIn the beginning, Napoleon abandons a battle at the Egyptian pyramids because Joséphine is unfaithful at home in Paris. It is pure fiction.Much later, when the two have divorced, he marches on Paris from his famous exile on the island of Elba, because he is jealous that the Russian Tsar Alexander is apparently taking a swing with Joséphine. From whom Napoleon, by the way, has long since divorced.It is a distortion of history of the worst kind. Joséphine dies of pneumonia in 1814. Napoleon first marches on Paris in 1815 to regain power, a wild story that could be a whole movie in itself.If you´re gonna make an expensive movie like this, get things right instead of just making romantic stuff up."
"Napoleon","LongTimeMovieLover","23 November 2023",410,"First, let me get this out of the way. If you want to watch a focused masterpiece, watch Waterloo with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. It could have only been better (for me) if Steiger had a French accent. Second, if you want to watch a general scoping history of Napoleon, consider the excellent and approachable Napoleon series with Christian Clavier (with a French accent), Isabella Rossallini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu. (Clavier is sometimes unfairly maligned when indeed he does a splendid job in my view.) There are other well-reputed less approachable versions, but these two are excellent.Now, as this work, let's start with Napoleon. A boyishly handsome, philosophically grounded (Napoleonic Code), egotistical, pugnacious genius, sometimes brooding sometimes loving, sometimes playing. That is, a strategically gifted, tactically trained, boyishly handsome, egotistical, passionate, lovable, fighting, moody, young genius.I am sorry, but this character requires someone like a young Brando or Pacino. Phoenix simply cannot, no-way, pull it off. Way wrong. Crazy wrong. He does not have the range. He is a great actor only in a particular type of role, a crouching villainous Caesar or a depressive Joker. A melancholic low-key whispering introverted Napoleon does not work, and some form of delusion by Scott allowed or put Phoenix into this role. I can easily get past failure of boyish good looks and the way wrong age (and Napoleon's young age is part of the story itself). But I cannot get past whispering tone and failure of charisma, passion and charm. Napoleon seduced a lot of people in a lot of ways.It's not Phoenix's fault he was miscast. Way miscast. Vanessa Kirby was fine and did her job. But, no one in this movie deserves any acting nominations. Take one common scene, being the ""Will you shoot your emperor?"" following Napoleon's escape from Elba and return to France, the other referenced Napoleons had timing, tension, and drama, here blah, nothing. Nothing! It's just bad. Really bad.Nothing in this movie taught me anything, made me think, made me feel, or moved me in any way. Terribly unengaging. Even the couple attempts at comic relief (if there would have been any tension, which was devoid) it was misplaced and failed miserably.Now, let's talk about the versions. This is the 2.5H version and there is another 4H version to be released by Apple+. Everything is a gimmick these days. Every streaming channel has one gem, but I'll suggest this work is inherently flawed by miscast Phoenix and more time to blend the scenes won't do it. In this 2.5H version, it's like a bunch of scenes without any context. We go from the French Revolution through the Reign of Terror through Napoleon's coup through Austerlitz through first defeat through Elba through return to France through Waterloo, through St. Helena. In 2.5H, even with the right actor who has engaging charisma and charm, it's too much ground. No character development whatsoever. None. Even in 4H it's like getting two bad suits for the price of one. It's just more of what's bad, which is miscast Phoenix in the titular role. I only understood the movie because I love and know the history. My wife and 86 year old father could not follow it, and my 19 year old daughter (somewhat tired from returning from college) dozed off a couple of times. No one liked the movie. And we even went out of our way to the IMAX because, well, it was Napoleon.I almost forgot to mention the emasculation of Napoleon by Josephine, the jarring politically correct now-required social normalizing casting of extras, and the ending credits that count the dead but give no context for the concomitant social reforms.Braveheart was historically all wrong, but it was still a great story with a wonderful score. This Napoleon is a bad story, and, even if Napoleon was a fictional character it was still bad. It's both a bad reflection of a real man, a grossly incomplete historical depiction, and a bad story poorly told no matter what.Napoleon was loved, hated, admired and ridiculed, by many of the same people, at different times. He was, if nothing else, one of the greatest characters in the recorded history of mankind. To try to do it all fairly, with the wrong titular actor, is silly. Really silly. Delusively silly.Sir Ridley's movie The Last Duel failed for a similar reason, and then he blames the audience. It's not the production or even perhaps the precise movie direction that is going wrong, it's that the story itself is not well-told. Perhaps it's time for him to teach his tactical craft to a young person with the right vision for the story expression.I need to watch my Waterloo DVD again to get my head back to the right flavor of Napoleon the Great, not Napoleon the Whisperer.Nothing good, new or better. A waste of my time and money."
"Napoleon","heisenberg12","23 November 2023",510,"The title says it all. When anyone thinks about Napolean, they automatically think of the general, the egomaniacal conquerer, military genius who glorified and unified France after the French Revolution.So going into an ""epic"" 2 hour and 40 minute movie, you would safely assume we'd get a glimpse into that twisted, genius mind, especially from an actor like Phoenix, right?Wrong. Instead we get practically a two hour, unoriginal portrait of his banal relationship with Josephine; yes, the rest of the 45 minutes are indeed battles that were good, not great. The lopsided focus on Josephine is unwarranted and unjustified, merely because we didn't learn anything new that we couldn't already assume if it only featured a half hour with their relationship on screen. Honestly, I still cannot fathom any point in that narrative decision after enduring it, as again, there were no twists or startling revelations; if the point was to just humanize Napoleon, we get it, he had a wife and dealt with her toxicity.The best part of the entire movie was the very end when the biographical title cards came up and revealed what a bloodlusting monster he really was, with the visceral explanation of the vast amount of lives he lost in his vain conquests. Back then, the world population was exponentially less than today. Three million in less than twenty years over 61 campaigns, with the Russian incursion costing three hundred plus thousand alone, seventy thousand at Waterloo. It's a shame that most of the tone of the movie not only was wasted on his love life, but moreso did not depict him as the maniacal sociopath he clearly was.On a side note, since we're delving into European French history and this piece failed to capture the period well enough, future filmmakers should hone in on the actual French Revolution. Tale of Two Cities, anyone? Nolan would crush it!4.5/10."
"Napoleon","malmevik77","25 November 2023",210,"NapoleonLet's start with the good things. The battle scenes are well shot, exciting, horrifying, the excellent work one can expect from a Ridley Scott movie.Josephine was fantastic. Her situation was clearly not ideal, and the actress portrayed her in such a way that I felt more for her than anyone else in the film.Now the bad things. All of it. This movie was not good at all. It was such a disappointment. This film had major problems with the flow of the story. It was extremely disjointed. I had no understanding of what was happening as it felt like someone took an outline and only filmed the bullet points, and not the detail beneath it. There is no transition from the coup in 1799 to the coronation in 1804. There is no explanation. There is no context as to how and why this was even acceptable.And don't get me started on historical inaccuracies. The very first scene shows Marie Antoinette getting beheaded in 1789 when that amazing invention called google can tell you otherwise.Maybe I'm being a bit harsh but I've studied English and French history quite extensively and it was cringe worthy to watch. Joaquin Phoenix was also very much miscast. I felt sorry for Vanessa Kirby as she was the highlight of the film. In all honesty, this film should have been called Josephine.I do not recommend watching this unless you're just there for the well shot battle scenes. The lake scene will give you chills. This film was a huge disappointment and I felt embarrassed for the filmmakers."
"Napoleon","itsahoverboard","23 November 2023",510,"Yes, that's a real quote from Joaquin Phoenix to Ridley Scott right before they started filming. I love Joaquin Phoenix, but you can really tell that he doesn't ""get"" the character of Napoleon that he's trying to play. I honestly don't know if Phoenix even has that kind of charisma and confidence within him, but then again I don't know anything about Napoleon either. But it was just uncomfortable watching him stumble his way through the movie, often just looking clueless.The other problem with the movie is it's just plain dull and uninteresting. It really does feel like a ""highlights"" movie. For an almost 3-hour film, it has surprisingly little dialogue. The dialogue that's there isn't' that illuminating or interesting. I normally like politics and romance (which is the bulk of this story), but I would have loved to see more military and war stuff in a movie like this. Isn't Napoleon supposed to be a brilliant war leader? There's like none of that here. Except ""oh we'll do a sneak attack in the night.""The cinematography was also really surprisingly dull. It looked super digital. The colors were so bland and washed out.Vanessa Kirby is really the best thing about the movie. And also the first battle taking over that fort, which was admittedly pretty epic. I have never seen such a thing happen to a horse in a movie, and it was wonderfully horrifying.I fully blame Ridley Scott for this dud. Hopefully Spielberg's Kubrick miniseries about Napoleon will be much better."
"Napoleon","zeki-4","22 November 2023",710,"Back in 2005 Ridley Scott's 144 minute version of 'Kingdom of Heaven' premiered in theatres to somewhat mixed reviews. A couple of years later the vastly superior 190 minute director's cut version finally arrived, with the general consensus that the final product was a masterclass in storytelling, directing, acting and cinematography. - without doubt the best motion picture ever made about the crusades.Almost 20 years later we are yet again treated with a compiled highlight reel of a Ridley Scott movie in the theatre, rather than a full-fledged historical epic, since it has already become official that 'Napoleon' will be released later on streaming with its entire runtime of almost four hours, which clearly is needed to flesh out many parts of the movie and fill in the emotional and historical blanks, because this - somewhat butchered cut - moves in a breakneck speed and feels too rushed.Whereas the underappreciated 1970 movie 'Waterloo' starring Rod Steiger as Napoleon Bonaparte, featuring thousands of extras, portrayed events only during the 100 days campaign in 1815, Scott's 'Napoleon' takes us through decades of various major events and battles beginning with the siege of Toulon in 1793. In this version we never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful. Why did he win the admiration of so many? It's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in real life, but here he is portrayed as a childish brute? It felt like the focus was more on setpieces and his troubled relationship with Josephine, than on him as a ruthless and cunning emperor, and in the theatre cut there really isn't a lot of places where Joaquin Phoenix truly shines as an Oscar contender. Maybe the director's cut will remedy that.In spite of its shortcomings (no pun intended) 'Napoleon' is still one of the best movies I have seen this year, but I am baffled. Because if people can sit through 3+ hour box office hits like 'Avengers Endgame', 'Avatar 2' and 'Oppenheimer' - why the need to release just a very extended trailer of 'Napoleon' in the theatre, especially when everyone know that they can just wait a couple of months for it to arrive on streaming in its entirety? An attempt by Apple at a cash grab? ""You need a subscription to our streaming service to watch the whole thing""?With that being said, I do predict some Oscar nominations here. Ridley Scott yet again proves why he is one of the best filmmakers out there. But a word of caution: If you only plan to see this once, you might consider waiting for the director's cut."
"Napoleon","gcarpiceci","22 November 2023",510,"History is an undesired guest taking the backseat in Mr Scott's sprawling epic on Napoleon's life.Mr Scott's craftsmanship is such that it's undoubtedly able to offer the viewer some unique experiences. But stunning battle visuals and great performances by the lead actors don't make up for gross historical approximation.I have no doubt whatsoever that Mr Scott knows his history and, if he didn't, he surely has a fat staff of assistants to tell it to him; so what he does here (as he did already in Gladiator) is a very deliberate and blatant choice to bend historical reality to the purposes of his own art, which looks like an act of unforgivable artistic hubris."
"Napoleon","richard-1787","27 November 2023",310,"This movie must have cost a fortune to make. (There is no budget listed yet here on IMDB.) You would think they could have spent a little of it on a good script. So many of the problems here stem from the bad script, which does not provide clues about what it going on.What we get is several large-scale but very unexciting battle scenes, where we watch the infantry march into suicidal battle, sometimes led by the cavalry, sometimes followed. In a movie about a fabled tactician, there is no discussion of what made him a success, what he did differently, etc.In between the battle episodes are some of the least romantic, un-erotic love scenes ever filmed. Phoenix and his leading lady have absolutely NO chemistry whatsoever. Half the time he is like a statue with her, the other half like an over-eager dog. We never get a hint of what he might see in her.I stayed through the whole 2.5 hours because I was with friends. Otherwise I would have left mid-way through, or fallen asleep - as Napoleon does several times himself during the battle scenes.I saw Oppenheimer, which is a full three hours long, three times last summer, and was riveted to it all three times. That movie was well directed. This movie didn't hold me at all, had no pacing, and was sometimes confusing even though I have studied that period of French history.Some will find fault with historical inaccuracies. There are evidently a fair number of them. But that doesn't bother me. What bothered me was that Scott and his crew never made this story come alive. Why spend all that money and all those resources on something that just is not interesting?"
"Napoleon","rachelnstephens","22 November 2023",410,"If I knew nothing of Napoleon, I'd be utterly confused about what was happening in this film. There is no hero's journey to follow and nobody to root for.Who is Napoleon? Why is he in France? How did he get to his position? The film begins with the death of Marie Antoinette and pretty much dives right into Napoleon being in charge somehow. Why Napoleon? No idea.Early on we meet Josephine's minor son who is never seen again on screen after a one-on-one meeting with Napoleon. Why does Napoleon meet with him? Why does he grant his request? Why is he interested in Josephine? No idea.The film feels as if you're a time traveller who is moving forward to different snapshots of Napoleon's life. There's little context or explanation. Lots of battle scenes, troop movement, flag signaling and even smelting to make munitions but not a lot of context. Why is Napoleon going here or there? No idea. What is his end goal? No idea. Why do Napoleon's men have an affinity for him? No idea.There are large spans of time between scenes so suddenly Josephine's daughter is a grown adult speaking with Napoleon. No clue who she was until Napoleon mentioned Josephine being her mother. Who are all of these people? No idea. How are they connected? No idea.The film is beautifully shot. The costuming is perfection. The set design is dreamy. Nobody can say that Ridley Scott doesn't know how to make a movie or that Joaquin Phoenix isn't a fantastic actor - it's simply a poor script."
"Napoleon","WadoodS","22 November 2023",510,"Making a movie on a charismatic person like Napoleon is a huge undertaking. It requires in-depth study of his life and then choosing specific events of his life to show and connecting them to perfection. The film maker is short in time therefore it is important for the movie to be precise, fluent and with a purpose. In this movie, the director, Ridley Scott, fails to determine which points of his life he wishes to portray and consequently it results in a piece-by-piece movie which lacks cinematic flow and confuses the audience.The movie disappoints in showing the battles, only briefly does it show the battles of Toulon and Austerlitz and then a bit longer Waterloo, of course concentrating more on Wellington's genius rather than Napoleon's side of things, where there is no mention of Marshal Grouchy's failed mission to block Blucher's army from joining the battle.As great an actor as Joaquin Phoenix is, he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. I felt like Napoleon was intentionally mimicked by the film maker to portray him as a socially awkward person who does not know his way around women, or even his soldiers who loved him so much. During the coup d'etat he is seen as a confused ""coward"" who escapes for his life and is only saved by the cleverness of his brother. But I have personally grown up around military personnel who are calm and composed in the face of adversity and prudently handle critical situations which makes it even more incredible that a military genius of Napoleon's stature would cower under pressure.Joaquin Phoenix's character lacks fundamental personal charisma which is so evident in leaders in general, and military leaders specifically. The movie fails to communicate why then the most civilized, liberal people on the planet earth during that time followed this uncharismatic, bland leader in 61 of his battles? French had already beheaded their king, and all French men were citizens with equal rights - at least only men. No other country in Europe has achieved this level of self-consciousness for human freedom at that time. There is also no mention of his civil, political, artistic achievements like the Code Napoleon or the great artists that flourished under him.Joaquin Phoenix is himself or rather he is still in his Joker character. Apparently, he didn't try enough to get into Napoleon's character. Look at Marlon Brando for example, who shines in his role as Napoleon. Joaquin is so one dimensional who seems to be asleep all the time and has no idea what he is doing while the real Napoleon was an energetic, charismatic, young, and quick individual.I tried to get over his age difference as he is too old to portray such a young person. Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined. He was 35 when he was crowned Emperor of the French. Joaquin Phoenix looks in his fifties in the whole movie. Vanessa Kirby's young age doesn't help much as Josephine was 6 years older. Vanessa Kirby plays brilliantly in her role and dominated every scene she was in as a cold, unfaithful, and then heart-broken queen.It was a brilliant opportunity wasted by the film makers. It could have been much better - as the brilliant life story is already there. The music could have been better. They should have used one of those music/sound directors Christopher Nolan uses in his movies. The cinematography was very good though. The battle scenes were filmed well. My friend pointed out that the cinematographer found his favorite angle on Vaness Kirby when they were in their private bedroom. I laughed more at this joke than at any ""funny"" moments in the movie. Overall, it is a below average movie. Don't go there with your hopes held high. I think Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie. Now I am not sure I will watch the director's cut. I am looking forward to a young, energetic director taking this enterprise and making a Braveheart-like movie."
"Napoleon","M_Exchange","22 November 2023",510,"As many of you know, Stanley Kubrick was obsessed with Napoleon, and he wanted to make his magnum opus about him near the end of his life. He never got around to it. I would have loved to have seen that film.This film is not a total disappointment, but it's far from great. I fell in love with its visuals, and I felt as if I was in the era of the 1790's/early 1800's. Its war scenes are good. Also, I appreciate that it does not hit the three hour mark, but it felt choppy and often incomplete. For instance, when Napoleon got punished a couple of times for his defeats one might think that he cut straight from a loss to a meeting with foreign dignitaries. In actuality, things were much messier in between.I never really felt a romantic spark between him and his first wife, and I never really felt much emotion ever throughout the entirety of the film. Even his death was rather anticlimactic and weak.I would recommend this film only to French people and history buffs."
"Napoleon","dorMancyx","22 November 2023",610,"I feel unsatisfied walking out of that theater after three hours of melancholy and confusion. I understand every single word and every single scene, but when they connect into a whole film I don't understand anything. To start off, the costume/production design, naturalistic sceneries, the two meticulously-depicted ancient warfares --- one amid the doleful squall of Austerlitz and another atop the dampened prairie of Waterloo --- and all other technical stuff are spotless. However, there's an anxiety-inducing problem with the narrative --- the movie has no focus. No climax, no resonating themes like Oppenheimer, just one plain, linear, chronological plot; and even that we get multiple baffling time jumps throughout. The plot is so simple that everything in the film was taught in my AP World History class last year in one day, except it nibbles on some superficial details. Highlighting the relationship between Napolean and Josephine is a unique take, and I do see efforts from the two esteemed performers to capture their mutual toxicity and intricacy, but this love story has barely anything to do with the movie's main arc, Napolean's personal rise and fall. Nothing! Two basically unrelated storylines unfolding in the most bland way possible. Also adding to this insipid mess is the score, which is composed primarily of classical or really old-sounding French folk --- what happened to Radiohead from the trailer? God Ridley I don't wanna say three hours of my life is wasted but it kinda is!I didn't think it was possible but, I think Oppenheimer's winning the Oscar."
"Napoleon","theRetiree","22 November 2023",410,"Just came from a full theater. At the end we got up and left in dead silence. No plot except broad strokes of history, little dialog, no passion, Phoenix seemed catatonic, and the movie was nothing more than set pieces posed to look like romantic paintings by Jacques-Louis David (who actually conveyed more emotion and spirit ). The early climax was Austerlitz, which Scott tried to stage as a replay of the destruction of the Teutonic Knights in Alexander.Nevsky. Wikipedia says maybe two of three soldiers (of thousands of casualties) died in the frozen ponds.Waterloo was equally lame, with French cavalry trying unsuccessfully to break the British Squares looking ridiculously like Plains Indians riding in circles attacking a wagon train. (Mel Brooks staged that better.) And Blucher's timely last minute arrival (which Wellington described as a ""near run thing"") had no tension and no suspense.Beautiful costumes and sets, a case of thousands, but unsatisfying either as historical spectacle or grand love affair, with Phoenix and the director both giving new meaning to the expression ""phoning it in."""
"Napoleon","jozenerd","26 November 2023",310,"During this movie, I just felt like watching a Monty Python's version of Napoleon or a BBC special based on a flyer they took on a train station about Napoleon's affairs and life troubles. Once again, Scott is making out his version of the history or the history that goes with his religion and political views. About Joaquin Phoenix's acting, it's sometimes laughable ala Eddie Redmayne on Jupiter Ascending, Halle Berry on Catwoman, or Marion Cotillard's death scene on Batman, that bad!!! Gosh, this movie is a reminder of past glories that are far gone and Mr. Scott is not deceiving me once again. He did it once with Covenant, guess who did it again? Not Britney!"

I made it toward the later half of the movie and everyone had already walked out, I decided to also walk out. It was the first film I ever walked out on. Here is why:Napoleon opens with what is seemingly going to be a historical biography film adaptation of Napoleon's life, what you instead get is a poorly made, half attempt at a comedy. That's not an exaggeration, it really does play out like a half attempted comedy that's neither funny nor entertaining.It starts in the French Revolution, the first problems was Joaquin Phoenix. I never thought he was a bad actor, but he's bad in this movie. Not only is he a bad Napoleon, not only is he way older looking than actual Napoleon (who is supposed to be 24 at the start of the film), but it's like he didn't even wanna play the role. I don't know what he was going for here but what we got is a bumbling fool with no confidence in any regard, no sign of intelligence, no backstory, no character development, no knowledge of his life outside of his marriage, and above all no historical accuracy whatsoever.This isn't only Joaquin Phoenix's fault, it's Ridley Scott and writer David Scarpa too. Everyone failed this project.If what you were looking for is a film about the Napoleonic Wars, look elsewhere. There is almost no war in it, and what little war there was, is only little clips of warfare, and then straight back to Napoleon's marriage life. Even if you found the marriage stuff interesting about Napoleon, this still isn't the movie for you, because it's not accurate and the film makes it's point early on, but for some reason they keep going over the same ground already covered about Napoleon's love life. It get's very repetitive and quite frankly, boring.These clips of combat we get are completely disconnected from the story, it looks like it's randomly thrown in. They're also really short. If you remember, the trailer has combat in Egypt. You see all that combat in the trailer, that's it. There's no more of it. The trailer was better than the movie.As a history buff (especially history on the French Revolution/Napoleonic Wars) and a film buff, it comes off as offensive to the entire subject matter it's covering in history, offensive to the entire art form of filmmaking, and offensive to the intelligence of it's viewer.It takes nothing seriously, all these huge events regardless of your opinion is treated with disrespect.But most historical events are absent from this film. It focuses so heavily on this marriage story that you don't care about it because the film never tried to make you care, to the point where you feel shocked to see how much time has passed and how many events they skipped when you finally see a date pop up on the screen or an actual recognizable event.Or if you don't know Napoleonic history, you will be entirely lost as to what's happening because it explains nothing, it doesn't even mention why the Napoleonic Wars is happening at all. It doesn't even cover Napoleon growing as a general. Or even growing as a person. The look of Napoleon is even lazily done in this.This version of Napoleon is such a fool instead of a smart general, he makes Napoleon Dynamite look like a cool, collected, Chad.From a film making perspective, the movie is horribly made, generic to bad camera work, a bland soundtrack, HORRIBLE writing, a plot that goes nowhere.The only positives I can find is that some of the costume design is good, the sets are pretty well made, and the one scene in the trailer with the ice was cool. But I'd say watch the trailer again instead of the movie. But that's it. Those are the only good things.If you like Napoleon you won't like this, if you hate Napoleon you won't like this. If you like history you won't like this. If you don't care about history you won't like this. It's poorly made and boring for all. Find any other Napoleon focused movie and I'm sure it will be more entertaining.The trailer makes it seem like a different movie. I feel scammed, I feel lied to.A history film about the Napoleonic Wars with no history, no Napoleonic Wars, and an inaccurate Napoleon that's not fun to watch and at times straight up cringe to witness, makes this movie a solid 1. No entertainment value."
"Napoleon","gmznffvs","22 November 2023",310,"Napoleon is one of the greatest characters in history. He came out of the ashes of the French Revolution to not only lead the country but to inspire it. People were given new hope, aspirations and above all opportunities.Bonaparte created the first meritocracy in Europe. Ordinary people rose to positions of significance in the arts, sciences and all walks of life. In his army almost all the generals came from ordinary backgrounds, whereas pre the Revolution they were aristos.Not one person who doesn't know about Napoleon will know any of this when they come out of the movie.There is nothing to give an insight to his motivation Hint, it wasn't all for Josephine. There was no politics. None of the brilliant generals who fought with him get a look in. Bernadot was invited to be king of Sweden! Talleyrand was a self serving rat, but here is a nobody.Even the election of his brothers to the thrones of other European countries is not worth a mention.Napoleon enjoyed his power. Phoenix mopes about with his usual stone face making every day seem a chore.The only good part, worth the three stars is Waterloo, which is a good battle scene, if not by any means perfect, but watching the move from line to square was satisfying.Now people will think this morose dull man was Napoleon. How could he have been? Why would the French have loved him? Why would they welcome him back.What a disappointment."
"Napoleon","imseeg","23 November 2023",610,"A word of warning for those expecting another Gladiator or non stop action spectacle. It is not. Truly not...The bad: director Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes look slick and impressive (and he does an excellent job again), but he is also known for being quite average at making a drama. And this movie tries (and partly fails) to combine action and drama and somehow ends up being neither one. THAT is one of the reasons I'll only rate it with 6 stars.More bad: this story has a weak ""dramatic"" middle (love story) part, which is kinda tedious. And that brings me to a storyline complaint, namely that this story is all over the place. They cram SO much events and history and different characters from different time periods into this one movie that it kinda confused and numbed me down, instead of thrilling me, as an epic should do.This movie was made for Apple streaming (release date january 2024) in the first place, but they made a shorter (butchered) version for the cinemas in order to be able to compete for the Oscars, which demands that a movie must have run in the cinemas for a couple of weeks. No cinema version, no Oscars.The original Apple streaming version lasted some 2 hours longer. Nobody is gonna sit in the cinema for over 4 hours, hence they cut this movie up and now it feels somewhat rushed, confusing and disjointed at certain moments.Not any good then? Joaquin Phoenix is the one redeeming feature. He nails it.. He makes Napoleon look like a complete joke of a man and I love Joaquin Phoenix' performance, but that unfortunately didnt compensate for the other actors being just about average and with little actor's chemistry between them.I had been warned beforehand by friends that this wasnt the spectacle or epic drama they were hoping for and unfortunately they were right. Certainly not a terrible movie, but one that is just about average.Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb."
"Napoleon","petra_ste","3 December 2023",610,"Ridley Scott directed one of the best movies ever made set during the Napoleonic Wars: unfortunately, that movie is not Napoleon but his cinematic debut, The Duellists, forty years ago.Unsurprisingly, The Duellists had a strong source material (it was based on a novel by Joseph Conrad which it often followed almost verbatim), while Napoleon has an uneven screenplay by David Scarpa.Even past the age of eighty Sir Ridley can still shoot pretty and energetic pictures but his hits and misses depend on the scripts he picks, and he hasn't always shown the best discernment.The elephant in the room is the large amount of historical inaccuracies. Even as a history buff I can forgive many of those: cutting or simplifying events for the sake of narrative, or even some overdramatization like the meeting between Napoleon and Wellington (it never happened) or Napoleon being present at Marie Antoinette's execution (he wasn't); however, stuff like Napoleon charging with his troops at Waterloo is absolute cringe, a kid's (or a lout's) idea of history.Still, the big problems here are characterization and pacing.The movie is a demythologization (some would say emasculation) of Napoleon. If you want to take this route then fair enough, but the character here fails to be consistent. I can buy a Napoleon who is an egomaniac and an overrated tactician (like in Tolstoy's War and Peace). I do not buy one who is an anxious, insecure, uncharismatic cold fish but also a stern tactical genius and an effective leader of men, one who flees from Egypt because Josephine is unfaithful but is also an unflappable military mastermind.Phoenix is a great actor and does what he can but the two sides of the character just don't gel with each other. You can't have parodic moments like Napoleon rolling down the stairs during his coup against the Directory, despondently pouting as he waits for the rain to stop at Waterloo or awkwardly climbing on a box to stand face to face with a pharaoh's mummy (with his diminutive stature becoming a not-too-subtle metaphor of his overall mediocrity)... AND THEN have him magnetically charm the French soldiers into obedience after the Elba. This gawky Napoleon would have been shot to pieces there.The other problem is pacing. A single movie about the whole life of Napoleon is in itself absurd, like making ""a movie about World War 2"". There is material in Napoleon's life for a VERY dense miniseries (which Steven Spielberg is reportedly planning).Napoleon's first wife Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) plays a huge role here but I would argue the movie has either too little or way too much of her. This needed to be either focused mostly on Napoleon's personal life or to drastically reduce the (fairly repetitive after a while) moments where Napoleon is obsessed with his wife.As it is now, it tries to tell - but rushes through - twenty very eventful years of European history and yet devotes more time to Napoleon visiting Josephine after their divorce than to his Russian campaign.It's like making a D-Day movie which keeps cutting back and forth from the Normandy landings to Hitler spending time with Eva Braun. You can have either The Longest Day or Der Untergang, not both.Still, it's not worthless. There are some interesting moments and set-pieces and, while Phoenix is saddled with a contradictory character, Kirby at least is excellent.6/10."
"Napoleon","MissSimonetta","25 November 2023",210,"Ridley Scott's NAPOLEON feels like the highlight reel of a lengthy miniseries. Considering there's a 4-hour cut of this film, that explains it all.NAPOLEON is certainly good spectacle. The battle scenes are breathtaking. Unfortunately, it's also shallow. I know Scott has sneered at viewers criticizing the historical inaccuracies in the film, but I'm more bothered by a total lack of interesting character psychology or even coherent storytelling. Characters pop in and out, leaving little impression in their brief scenes. Relationships between characters are barely fleshed out, including that of Napoleon and Josephine, which dominates the running time. Also, potentially unpopular opinion, I thought Joaquin Phoenix's performance was a one-note bore.Perhaps the 4-hour version is a richer piece of work. As is, NAPOLEON is a let down, especially after Scott's brilliant 2021 period piece THE LAST DUEL, which had all the drama and psychological depth this movie lacked."
"Napoleon","dhunjiwadia","26 November 2023",510,"Ridley Scott's Napoleon is more hysterical than historical. History is like an uninvited guest in this movie. Stunning battle visuals don't make up for gross historical approximations.If you want to watch a masterpiece then see Waterloo, with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. And if you want a historical enumeration then watch the Napoleon series with Christian Clavier, Isabella Rossalini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu.This movie was made for Apple streaming. Then they made a butchered version for cinema to be able to compete for the Oscars. The original Apple streaming version will be at least 2 hours longer. This cut version for cinema is somewhat rushed, disjointed and, as a result, confusing.We never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful and won the admiration of so many. Here it's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in reality, over here he's shown as a childish brute. The focus was more on set pieces and his relationship with Josephine.Joaquin Phoenix can play odd or troubled characters well. Here he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. He's too old for this role (Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined) and made the character seem bizarre than a charismatic leader. Vanessa Kirby as Josephine gets more traction.The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is of a very high order. The battle scenes are filmed well. Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes slick and impressive. But overall it's a below average movie. Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie."
"Napoleon","krzysiektom","26 November 2023",210,"What a disappointment. This film is BORING. A movie with a huge budget, good actors, about a person as fascinating and complex as Bonaparte, who participated in more than 60 battles and had drama, triumphs and failures that would be enough for a few lifetimes, is... BORING! Nothing is well explained, it's unclear who is who beside Napoleon and Josephine. Several unnecessary sex scenes between the two. What's even worse is that it's unclear why the French nation would follow and worship this Napoleon as he's portrayed in this movie, because in this movie he seems a mediocre personality, without much charisma or extraordinary abilities. In addition, everything on the screen looks greyish blue, without vivid colors, and it is a bit depressing. I liked only two elements of this movie: musical score and costumes."
"Napoleon","levybob","2 December 2023",410,"I read the reviews of Ridley Scott's 'Napoleon' and knew it was not the great film everyone anticipated. Even so, I went. And what I discovered is that it's bad in the worst kind of way; It is dull. Lifeless. A flat un-involving story about characters who are in every way unlikable. Another reviewer wrote that he / she had trouble staying awake through its 2 hours 40 minutes run-time. When I read that I laughed. Now that I have seen the film, I am laughing no longer.Napoleon Bonaparte as Emperor of France did a lot of good things; much of the country's 'Civil Code' was instituted during his reign. But this film deals only with (a) Napoleon the warrior and (b) Napoleon the husband, and fails to deliver a well-rounded character in either sense. We know he loves France but aside from living there we don't know what drives his passion. His hatred for anything not France is clear, but the reasons for this hatred are never explained. There are battles a'plenty but the reason for them is elusive. Enemies become friends. Friends become enemies. We care about none of them. Thousands die. Somehow we care nothing about them either.There is, in Napoleon, no one to root for. Making matters worse there is an uneven performance by Joaquin Phoenix. His 'later' Napoleon becomes a different character than we'd seen earlier in the film. And no, I don't think it is attributed to Napoleon's rise in power. I think it's Phoenix; his acting, his portrayal. His Napoleon is far less quirky as the film progresses (as though the actor wants out of his role), and in this way, he is far less interesting.If there's anyone about whom we do care that character would be Josephine, Napoleon's wife and Empress of France. Vanessa Kirby is ravishing in the role. A rare beauty but one with a shadow-filled past as well as future. We can understand Napoleon's undying love her but the truth is, she's not the nicest girl on the block. There's little doubt that Mr. Bonaparte would never have 'won' her, were he not the country's future leader. So, again, no one to truly root for.Ah, yes. The battle scenes. They're fine (though it seems as though a battle fought at the base of Egypt's pyramids was cut out). But I think fewer battles and more unraveling of the reasons behind those battles between France, England, Russia, Austria, and other countries might make the remaining battles more meaningful.More involving.Which, as I said, this film is definitely not."
"Napoleon","Eleatic67","2 March 2024",610,"The success of any film depends mostly on the script. Why Scott would initiate such an expensive project without ensuring a refined and sophisticated script is a mystery. I'm not convinced there is a single interesting scene that provides insight into the characters or captures through language the prevailing political ideas. Scott's frequent missteps as a director reflect a greater interest in the cinematic rather than in the dramatic. However, this seems inevitable when your priority is delivering a blockbuster that will have broad appeal instead of digging deeper into culture, society, or history. A colossal waste of an extraordinary opportunity to create an important film about a fascinating historical figure."
"Napoleon","Vic_max","22 November 2023",610,"Many of Ridley Scott's movies are like visual masterpieces with epic storylines. I was sort of expecting something like Gladiator. Instead, it was just ""meh"" - I probably would have quit watching if it was on TV.Joaquin Phoenix has demonstrated that he can play odd or troubled characters well, but I don't think he was a good choice for Napoleon. He made the character seem more bizarre than charismatic or leader-like. I think the strongest and most interesting character was actually Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) ... who will probably get the most traction from the movie.The story itself wasn't that interesting because it wasn't explained that well. For example, his departure from Elba island seemed to randomly happen without much explanation. The elevation to a monarch-like role also happens without much explanation. It's like you're watching snippets of a bigger, more interesting story.I become so disconnected from the story that I almost fell asleep during some of the long battle sequences.The movie would probably have been better if it captured just one pivotal event or time period ... or better yet, if it had been a miniseries. While I will still look forward to any future movie from Scott, Napoleon deserved better."
"Napoleon","epicking","23 November 2023",310,"Im only focused on the historical aspect here ... and I only mentions a couple of out many hereIn the beginning, Napoleon abandons a battle at the Egyptian pyramids because Joséphine is unfaithful at home in Paris. It is pure fiction.Much later, when the two have divorced, he marches on Paris from his famous exile on the island of Elba, because he is jealous that the Russian Tsar Alexander is apparently taking a swing with Joséphine. From whom Napoleon, by the way, has long since divorced.It is a distortion of history of the worst kind. Joséphine dies of pneumonia in 1814. Napoleon first marches on Paris in 1815 to regain power, a wild story that could be a whole movie in itself.If you´re gonna make an expensive movie like this, get things right instead of just making romantic stuff up."
"Napoleon","LongTimeMovieLover","23 November 2023",410,"First, let me get this out of the way. If you want to watch a focused masterpiece, watch Waterloo with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. It could have only been better (for me) if Steiger had a French accent. Second, if you want to watch a general scoping history of Napoleon, consider the excellent and approachable Napoleon series with Christian Clavier (with a French accent), Isabella Rossallini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu. (Clavier is sometimes unfairly maligned when indeed he does a splendid job in my view.) There are other well-reputed less approachable versions, but these two are excellent.Now, as this work, let's start with Napoleon. A boyishly handsome, philosophically grounded (Napoleonic Code), egotistical, pugnacious genius, sometimes brooding sometimes loving, sometimes playing. That is, a strategically gifted, tactically trained, boyishly handsome, egotistical, passionate, lovable, fighting, moody, young genius.I am sorry, but this character requires someone like a young Brando or Pacino. Phoenix simply cannot, no-way, pull it off. Way wrong. Crazy wrong. He does not have the range. He is a great actor only in a particular type of role, a crouching villainous Caesar or a depressive Joker. A melancholic low-key whispering introverted Napoleon does not work, and some form of delusion by Scott allowed or put Phoenix into this role. I can easily get past failure of boyish good looks and the way wrong age (and Napoleon's young age is part of the story itself). But I cannot get past whispering tone and failure of charisma, passion and charm. Napoleon seduced a lot of people in a lot of ways.It's not Phoenix's fault he was miscast. Way miscast. Vanessa Kirby was fine and did her job. But, no one in this movie deserves any acting nominations. Take one common scene, being the ""Will you shoot your emperor?"" following Napoleon's escape from Elba and return to France, the other referenced Napoleons had timing, tension, and drama, here blah, nothing. Nothing! It's just bad. Really bad.Nothing in this movie taught me anything, made me think, made me feel, or moved me in any way. Terribly unengaging. Even the couple attempts at comic relief (if there would have been any tension, which was devoid) it was misplaced and failed miserably.Now, let's talk about the versions. This is the 2.5H version and there is another 4H version to be released by Apple+. Everything is a gimmick these days. Every streaming channel has one gem, but I'll suggest this work is inherently flawed by miscast Phoenix and more time to blend the scenes won't do it. In this 2.5H version, it's like a bunch of scenes without any context. We go from the French Revolution through the Reign of Terror through Napoleon's coup through Austerlitz through first defeat through Elba through return to France through Waterloo, through St. Helena. In 2.5H, even with the right actor who has engaging charisma and charm, it's too much ground. No character development whatsoever. None. Even in 4H it's like getting two bad suits for the price of one. It's just more of what's bad, which is miscast Phoenix in the titular role. I only understood the movie because I love and know the history. My wife and 86 year old father could not follow it, and my 19 year old daughter (somewhat tired from returning from college) dozed off a couple of times. No one liked the movie. And we even went out of our way to the IMAX because, well, it was Napoleon.I almost forgot to mention the emasculation of Napoleon by Josephine, the jarring politically correct now-required social normalizing casting of extras, and the ending credits that count the dead but give no context for the concomitant social reforms.Braveheart was historically all wrong, but it was still a great story with a wonderful score. This Napoleon is a bad story, and, even if Napoleon was a fictional character it was still bad. It's both a bad reflection of a real man, a grossly incomplete historical depiction, and a bad story poorly told no matter what.Napoleon was loved, hated, admired and ridiculed, by many of the same people, at different times. He was, if nothing else, one of the greatest characters in the recorded history of mankind. To try to do it all fairly, with the wrong titular actor, is silly. Really silly. Delusively silly.Sir Ridley's movie The Last Duel failed for a similar reason, and then he blames the audience. It's not the production or even perhaps the precise movie direction that is going wrong, it's that the story itself is not well-told. Perhaps it's time for him to teach his tactical craft to a young person with the right vision for the story expression.I need to watch my Waterloo DVD again to get my head back to the right flavor of Napoleon the Great, not Napoleon the Whisperer.Nothing good, new or better. A waste of my time and money."
"Napoleon","heisenberg12","23 November 2023",510,"The title says it all. When anyone thinks about Napolean, they automatically think of the general, the egomaniacal conquerer, military genius who glorified and unified France after the French Revolution.So going into an ""epic"" 2 hour and 40 minute movie, you would safely assume we'd get a glimpse into that twisted, genius mind, especially from an actor like Phoenix, right?Wrong. Instead we get practically a two hour, unoriginal portrait of his banal relationship with Josephine; yes, the rest of the 45 minutes are indeed battles that were good, not great. The lopsided focus on Josephine is unwarranted and unjustified, merely because we didn't learn anything new that we couldn't already assume if it only featured a half hour with their relationship on screen. Honestly, I still cannot fathom any point in that narrative decision after enduring it, as again, there were no twists or startling revelations; if the point was to just humanize Napoleon, we get it, he had a wife and dealt with her toxicity.The best part of the entire movie was the very end when the biographical title cards came up and revealed what a bloodlusting monster he really was, with the visceral explanation of the vast amount of lives he lost in his vain conquests. Back then, the world population was exponentially less than today. Three million in less than twenty years over 61 campaigns, with the Russian incursion costing three hundred plus thousand alone, seventy thousand at Waterloo. It's a shame that most of the tone of the movie not only was wasted on his love life, but moreso did not depict him as the maniacal sociopath he clearly was.On a side note, since we're delving into European French history and this piece failed to capture the period well enough, future filmmakers should hone in on the actual French Revolution. Tale of Two Cities, anyone? Nolan would crush it!4.5/10."
"Napoleon","malmevik77","25 November 2023",210,"NapoleonLet's start with the good things. The battle scenes are well shot, exciting, horrifying, the excellent work one can expect from a Ridley Scott movie.Josephine was fantastic. Her situation was clearly not ideal, and the actress portrayed her in such a way that I felt more for her than anyone else in the film.Now the bad things. All of it. This movie was not good at all. It was such a disappointment. This film had major problems with the flow of the story. It was extremely disjointed. I had no understanding of what was happening as it felt like someone took an outline and only filmed the bullet points, and not the detail beneath it. There is no transition from the coup in 1799 to the coronation in 1804. There is no explanation. There is no context as to how and why this was even acceptable.And don't get me started on historical inaccuracies. The very first scene shows Marie Antoinette getting beheaded in 1789 when that amazing invention called google can tell you otherwise.Maybe I'm being a bit harsh but I've studied English and French history quite extensively and it was cringe worthy to watch. Joaquin Phoenix was also very much miscast. I felt sorry for Vanessa Kirby as she was the highlight of the film. In all honesty, this film should have been called Josephine.I do not recommend watching this unless you're just there for the well shot battle scenes. The lake scene will give you chills. This film was a huge disappointment and I felt embarrassed for the filmmakers."
"Napoleon","itsahoverboard","23 November 2023",510,"Yes, that's a real quote from Joaquin Phoenix to Ridley Scott right before they started filming. I love Joaquin Phoenix, but you can really tell that he doesn't ""get"" the character of Napoleon that he's trying to play. I honestly don't know if Phoenix even has that kind of charisma and confidence within him, but then again I don't know anything about Napoleon either. But it was just uncomfortable watching him stumble his way through the movie, often just looking clueless.The other problem with the movie is it's just plain dull and uninteresting. It really does feel like a ""highlights"" movie. For an almost 3-hour film, it has surprisingly little dialogue. The dialogue that's there isn't' that illuminating or interesting. I normally like politics and romance (which is the bulk of this story), but I would have loved to see more military and war stuff in a movie like this. Isn't Napoleon supposed to be a brilliant war leader? There's like none of that here. Except ""oh we'll do a sneak attack in the night.""The cinematography was also really surprisingly dull. It looked super digital. The colors were so bland and washed out.Vanessa Kirby is really the best thing about the movie. And also the first battle taking over that fort, which was admittedly pretty epic. I have never seen such a thing happen to a horse in a movie, and it was wonderfully horrifying.I fully blame Ridley Scott for this dud. Hopefully Spielberg's Kubrick miniseries about Napoleon will be much better."
"Napoleon","zeki-4","22 November 2023",710,"Back in 2005 Ridley Scott's 144 minute version of 'Kingdom of Heaven' premiered in theatres to somewhat mixed reviews. A couple of years later the vastly superior 190 minute director's cut version finally arrived, with the general consensus that the final product was a masterclass in storytelling, directing, acting and cinematography. - without doubt the best motion picture ever made about the crusades.Almost 20 years later we are yet again treated with a compiled highlight reel of a Ridley Scott movie in the theatre, rather than a full-fledged historical epic, since it has already become official that 'Napoleon' will be released later on streaming with its entire runtime of almost four hours, which clearly is needed to flesh out many parts of the movie and fill in the emotional and historical blanks, because this - somewhat butchered cut - moves in a breakneck speed and feels too rushed.Whereas the underappreciated 1970 movie 'Waterloo' starring Rod Steiger as Napoleon Bonaparte, featuring thousands of extras, portrayed events only during the 100 days campaign in 1815, Scott's 'Napoleon' takes us through decades of various major events and battles beginning with the siege of Toulon in 1793. In this version we never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful. Why did he win the admiration of so many? It's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in real life, but here he is portrayed as a childish brute? It felt like the focus was more on setpieces and his troubled relationship with Josephine, than on him as a ruthless and cunning emperor, and in the theatre cut there really isn't a lot of places where Joaquin Phoenix truly shines as an Oscar contender. Maybe the director's cut will remedy that.In spite of its shortcomings (no pun intended) 'Napoleon' is still one of the best movies I have seen this year, but I am baffled. Because if people can sit through 3+ hour box office hits like 'Avengers Endgame', 'Avatar 2' and 'Oppenheimer' - why the need to release just a very extended trailer of 'Napoleon' in the theatre, especially when everyone know that they can just wait a couple of months for it to arrive on streaming in its entirety? An attempt by Apple at a cash grab? ""You need a subscription to our streaming service to watch the whole thing""?With that being said, I do predict some Oscar nominations here. Ridley Scott yet again proves why he is one of the best filmmakers out there. But a word of caution: If you only plan to see this once, you might consider waiting for the director's cut."
"Napoleon","gcarpiceci","22 November 2023",510,"History is an undesired guest taking the backseat in Mr Scott's sprawling epic on Napoleon's life.Mr Scott's craftsmanship is such that it's undoubtedly able to offer the viewer some unique experiences. But stunning battle visuals and great performances by the lead actors don't make up for gross historical approximation.I have no doubt whatsoever that Mr Scott knows his history and, if he didn't, he surely has a fat staff of assistants to tell it to him; so what he does here (as he did already in Gladiator) is a very deliberate and blatant choice to bend historical reality to the purposes of his own art, which looks like an act of unforgivable artistic hubris."
"Napoleon","richard-1787","27 November 2023",310,"This movie must have cost a fortune to make. (There is no budget listed yet here on IMDB.) You would think they could have spent a little of it on a good script. So many of the problems here stem from the bad script, which does not provide clues about what it going on.What we get is several large-scale but very unexciting battle scenes, where we watch the infantry march into suicidal battle, sometimes led by the cavalry, sometimes followed. In a movie about a fabled tactician, there is no discussion of what made him a success, what he did differently, etc.In between the battle episodes are some of the least romantic, un-erotic love scenes ever filmed. Phoenix and his leading lady have absolutely NO chemistry whatsoever. Half the time he is like a statue with her, the other half like an over-eager dog. We never get a hint of what he might see in her.I stayed through the whole 2.5 hours because I was with friends. Otherwise I would have left mid-way through, or fallen asleep - as Napoleon does several times himself during the battle scenes.I saw Oppenheimer, which is a full three hours long, three times last summer, and was riveted to it all three times. That movie was well directed. This movie didn't hold me at all, had no pacing, and was sometimes confusing even though I have studied that period of French history.Some will find fault with historical inaccuracies. There are evidently a fair number of them. But that doesn't bother me. What bothered me was that Scott and his crew never made this story come alive. Why spend all that money and all those resources on something that just is not interesting?"
"Napoleon","rachelnstephens","22 November 2023",410,"If I knew nothing of Napoleon, I'd be utterly confused about what was happening in this film. There is no hero's journey to follow and nobody to root for.Who is Napoleon? Why is he in France? How did he get to his position? The film begins with the death of Marie Antoinette and pretty much dives right into Napoleon being in charge somehow. Why Napoleon? No idea.Early on we meet Josephine's minor son who is never seen again on screen after a one-on-one meeting with Napoleon. Why does Napoleon meet with him? Why does he grant his request? Why is he interested in Josephine? No idea.The film feels as if you're a time traveller who is moving forward to different snapshots of Napoleon's life. There's little context or explanation. Lots of battle scenes, troop movement, flag signaling and even smelting to make munitions but not a lot of context. Why is Napoleon going here or there? No idea. What is his end goal? No idea. Why do Napoleon's men have an affinity for him? No idea.There are large spans of time between scenes so suddenly Josephine's daughter is a grown adult speaking with Napoleon. No clue who she was until Napoleon mentioned Josephine being her mother. Who are all of these people? No idea. How are they connected? No idea.The film is beautifully shot. The costuming is perfection. The set design is dreamy. Nobody can say that Ridley Scott doesn't know how to make a movie or that Joaquin Phoenix isn't a fantastic actor - it's simply a poor script."
"Napoleon","WadoodS","22 November 2023",510,"Making a movie on a charismatic person like Napoleon is a huge undertaking. It requires in-depth study of his life and then choosing specific events of his life to show and connecting them to perfection. The film maker is short in time therefore it is important for the movie to be precise, fluent and with a purpose. In this movie, the director, Ridley Scott, fails to determine which points of his life he wishes to portray and consequently it results in a piece-by-piece movie which lacks cinematic flow and confuses the audience.The movie disappoints in showing the battles, only briefly does it show the battles of Toulon and Austerlitz and then a bit longer Waterloo, of course concentrating more on Wellington's genius rather than Napoleon's side of things, where there is no mention of Marshal Grouchy's failed mission to block Blucher's army from joining the battle.As great an actor as Joaquin Phoenix is, he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. I felt like Napoleon was intentionally mimicked by the film maker to portray him as a socially awkward person who does not know his way around women, or even his soldiers who loved him so much. During the coup d'etat he is seen as a confused ""coward"" who escapes for his life and is only saved by the cleverness of his brother. But I have personally grown up around military personnel who are calm and composed in the face of adversity and prudently handle critical situations which makes it even more incredible that a military genius of Napoleon's stature would cower under pressure.Joaquin Phoenix's character lacks fundamental personal charisma which is so evident in leaders in general, and military leaders specifically. The movie fails to communicate why then the most civilized, liberal people on the planet earth during that time followed this uncharismatic, bland leader in 61 of his battles? French had already beheaded their king, and all French men were citizens with equal rights - at least only men. No other country in Europe has achieved this level of self-consciousness for human freedom at that time. There is also no mention of his civil, political, artistic achievements like the Code Napoleon or the great artists that flourished under him.Joaquin Phoenix is himself or rather he is still in his Joker character. Apparently, he didn't try enough to get into Napoleon's character. Look at Marlon Brando for example, who shines in his role as Napoleon. Joaquin is so one dimensional who seems to be asleep all the time and has no idea what he is doing while the real Napoleon was an energetic, charismatic, young, and quick individual.I tried to get over his age difference as he is too old to portray such a young person. Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined. He was 35 when he was crowned Emperor of the French. Joaquin Phoenix looks in his fifties in the whole movie. Vanessa Kirby's young age doesn't help much as Josephine was 6 years older. Vanessa Kirby plays brilliantly in her role and dominated every scene she was in as a cold, unfaithful, and then heart-broken queen.It was a brilliant opportunity wasted by the film makers. It could have been much better - as the brilliant life story is already there. The music could have been better. They should have used one of those music/sound directors Christopher Nolan uses in his movies. The cinematography was very good though. The battle scenes were filmed well. My friend pointed out that the cinematographer found his favorite angle on Vaness Kirby when they were in their private bedroom. I laughed more at this joke than at any ""funny"" moments in the movie. Overall, it is a below average movie. Don't go there with your hopes held high. I think Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie. Now I am not sure I will watch the director's cut. I am looking forward to a young, energetic director taking this enterprise and making a Braveheart-like movie."
"Napoleon","M_Exchange","22 November 2023",510,"As many of you know, Stanley Kubrick was obsessed with Napoleon, and he wanted to make his magnum opus about him near the end of his life. He never got around to it. I would have loved to have seen that film.This film is not a total disappointment, but it's far from great. I fell in love with its visuals, and I felt as if I was in the era of the 1790's/early 1800's. Its war scenes are good. Also, I appreciate that it does not hit the three hour mark, but it felt choppy and often incomplete. For instance, when Napoleon got punished a couple of times for his defeats one might think that he cut straight from a loss to a meeting with foreign dignitaries. In actuality, things were much messier in between.I never really felt a romantic spark between him and his first wife, and I never really felt much emotion ever throughout the entirety of the film. Even his death was rather anticlimactic and weak.I would recommend this film only to French people and history buffs."
"Napoleon","dorMancyx","22 November 2023",610,"I feel unsatisfied walking out of that theater after three hours of melancholy and confusion. I understand every single word and every single scene, but when they connect into a whole film I don't understand anything. To start off, the costume/production design, naturalistic sceneries, the two meticulously-depicted ancient warfares --- one amid the doleful squall of Austerlitz and another atop the dampened prairie of Waterloo --- and all other technical stuff are spotless. However, there's an anxiety-inducing problem with the narrative --- the movie has no focus. No climax, no resonating themes like Oppenheimer, just one plain, linear, chronological plot; and even that we get multiple baffling time jumps throughout. The plot is so simple that everything in the film was taught in my AP World History class last year in one day, except it nibbles on some superficial details. Highlighting the relationship between Napolean and Josephine is a unique take, and I do see efforts from the two esteemed performers to capture their mutual toxicity and intricacy, but this love story has barely anything to do with the movie's main arc, Napolean's personal rise and fall. Nothing! Two basically unrelated storylines unfolding in the most bland way possible. Also adding to this insipid mess is the score, which is composed primarily of classical or really old-sounding French folk --- what happened to Radiohead from the trailer? God Ridley I don't wanna say three hours of my life is wasted but it kinda is!I didn't think it was possible but, I think Oppenheimer's winning the Oscar."
"Napoleon","theRetiree","22 November 2023",410,"Just came from a full theater. At the end we got up and left in dead silence. No plot except broad strokes of history, little dialog, no passion, Phoenix seemed catatonic, and the movie was nothing more than set pieces posed to look like romantic paintings by Jacques-Louis David (who actually conveyed more emotion and spirit ). The early climax was Austerlitz, which Scott tried to stage as a replay of the destruction of the Teutonic Knights in Alexander.Nevsky. Wikipedia says maybe two of three soldiers (of thousands of casualties) died in the frozen ponds.Waterloo was equally lame, with French cavalry trying unsuccessfully to break the British Squares looking ridiculously like Plains Indians riding in circles attacking a wagon train. (Mel Brooks staged that better.) And Blucher's timely last minute arrival (which Wellington described as a ""near run thing"") had no tension and no suspense.Beautiful costumes and sets, a case of thousands, but unsatisfying either as historical spectacle or grand love affair, with Phoenix and the director both giving new meaning to the expression ""phoning it in."""
"Napoleon","jozenerd","26 November 2023",310,"During this movie, I just felt like watching a Monty Python's version of Napoleon or a BBC special based on a flyer they took on a train station about Napoleon's affairs and life troubles. Once again, Scott is making out his version of the history or the history that goes with his religion and political views. About Joaquin Phoenix's acting, it's sometimes laughable ala Eddie Redmayne on Jupiter Ascending, Halle Berry on Catwoman, or Marion Cotillard's death scene on Batman, that bad!!! Gosh, this movie is a reminder of past glories that are far gone and Mr. Scott is not deceiving me once again. He did it once with Covenant, guess who did it again? Not Britney!"
"Napoleon","nlcckc","23 November 2023",210,"So here is a film about one of the greatest warlords of history, and what do you suppose it emphasizes? If your guess is the yucky ""relationship"" he had with Josephine, you're not far from the truth.Here's what this movie contains:

"Napoleon","OwneyH","23 November 2023",110,"This was one of the worst big budget movies I have ever seen. I made it toward the later half of the movie and everyone had already walked out, I decided to also walk out. It was the first film I ever walked out on. Here is why:Napoleon opens with what is seemingly going to be a historical biography film adaptation of Napoleon's life, what you instead get is a poorly made, half attempt at a comedy. That's not an exaggeration, it really does play out like a half attempted comedy that's neither funny nor entertaining.It starts in the French Revolution, the first problems was Joaquin Phoenix. I never thought he was a bad actor, but he's bad in this movie. Not only is he a bad Napoleon, not only is he way older looking than actual Napoleon (who is supposed to be 24 at the start of the film), but it's like he didn't even wanna play the role. I don't know what he was going for here but what we got is a bumbling fool with no confidence in any regard, no sign of intelligence, no backstory, no character development, no knowledge of his life outside of his marriage, and above all no historical accuracy whatsoever.This isn't only Joaquin Phoenix's fault, it's Ridley Scott and writer David Scarpa too. Everyone failed this project.If what you were looking for is a film about the Napoleonic Wars, look elsewhere. There is almost no war in it, and what little war there was, is only little clips of warfare, and then straight back to Napoleon's marriage life. Even if you found the marriage stuff interesting about Napoleon, this still isn't the movie for you, because it's not accurate and the film makes it's point early on, but for some reason they keep going over the same ground already covered about Napoleon's love life. It get's very repetitive and quite frankly, boring.These clips of combat we get are completely disconnected from the story, it looks like it's randomly thrown in. They're also really short. If you remember, the trailer has combat in Egypt. You see all that combat in the trailer, that's it. There's no more of it. The trailer was better than the movie.As a history buff (especially history on the French Revolution/Napoleonic Wars) and a film buff, it comes off as offensive to the entire subject matter it's covering in history, offensive to the entire art form of filmmaking, and offensive to the intelligence of it's viewer.It takes nothing seriously, all these huge events regardless of your opinion is treated with disrespect.But most historical events are absent from this film. It focuses so heavily on this marriage story that you don't care about it because the film never tried to make you care, to the point where you feel shocked to see how much time has passed and how many events they skipped when you finally see a date pop up on the screen or an actual recognizable event.Or if you don't know Napoleonic history, you will be entirely lost as to what's happening because it explains nothing, it doesn't even mention why the Napoleonic Wars is happening at all. It doesn't even cover Napoleon growing as a general. Or even growing as a person. The look of Napoleon is even lazily done in this.This version of Napoleon is such a fool instead of a smart general, he makes Napoleon Dynamite look like a cool, collected, Chad.From a film making perspective, the movie is horribly made, generic to bad camera work, a bland soundtrack, HORRIBLE writing, a plot that goes nowhere.The only positives I can find is that some of the costume design is good, the sets are pretty well made, and the one scene in the trailer with the ice was cool. But I'd say watch the trailer again instead of the movie. But that's it. Those are the only good things.If you like Napoleon you won't like this, if you hate Napoleon you won't like this. If you like history you won't like this. If you don't care about history you won't like this. It's poorly made and boring for all. Find any other Napoleon focused movie and I'm sure it will be more entertaining.The trailer makes it seem like a different movie. I feel scammed, I feel lied to.A history film about the Napoleonic Wars with no history, no Napoleonic Wars, and an inaccurate Napoleon that's not fun to watch and at times straight up cringe to witness, makes this movie a solid 1. No entertainment value."
"Napoleon","gmznffvs","22 November 2023",310,"Napoleon is one of the greatest characters in history. He came out of the ashes of the French Revolution to not only lead the country but to inspire it. People were given new hope, aspirations and above all opportunities.Bonaparte created the first meritocracy in Europe. Ordinary people rose to positions of significance in the arts, sciences and all walks of life. In his army almost all the generals came from ordinary backgrounds, whereas pre the Revolution they were aristos.Not one person who doesn't know about Napoleon will know any of this when they come out of the movie.There is nothing to give an insight to his motivation Hint, it wasn't all for Josephine. There was no politics. None of the brilliant generals who fought with him get a look in. Bernadot was invited to be king of Sweden! Talleyrand was a self serving rat, but here is a nobody.Even the election of his brothers to the thrones of other European countries is not worth a mention.Napoleon enjoyed his power. Phoenix mopes about with his usual stone face making every day seem a chore.The only good part, worth the three stars is Waterloo, which is a good battle scene, if not by any means perfect, but watching the move from line to square was satisfying.Now people will think this morose dull man was Napoleon. How could he have been? Why would the French have loved him? Why would they welcome him back.What a disappointment."
"Napoleon","imseeg","23 November 2023",610,"A word of warning for those expecting another Gladiator or non stop action spectacle. It is not. Truly not...The bad: director Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes look slick and impressive (and he does an excellent job again), but he is also known for being quite average at making a drama. And this movie tries (and partly fails) to combine action and drama and somehow ends up being neither one. THAT is one of the reasons I'll only rate it with 6 stars.More bad: this story has a weak ""dramatic"" middle (love story) part, which is kinda tedious. And that brings me to a storyline complaint, namely that this story is all over the place. They cram SO much events and history and different characters from different time periods into this one movie that it kinda confused and numbed me down, instead of thrilling me, as an epic should do.This movie was made for Apple streaming (release date january 2024) in the first place, but they made a shorter (butchered) version for the cinemas in order to be able to compete for the Oscars, which demands that a movie must have run in the cinemas for a couple of weeks. No cinema version, no Oscars.The original Apple streaming version lasted some 2 hours longer. Nobody is gonna sit in the cinema for over 4 hours, hence they cut this movie up and now it feels somewhat rushed, confusing and disjointed at certain moments.Not any good then? Joaquin Phoenix is the one redeeming feature. He nails it.. He makes Napoleon look like a complete joke of a man and I love Joaquin Phoenix' performance, but that unfortunately didnt compensate for the other actors being just about average and with little actor's chemistry between them.I had been warned beforehand by friends that this wasnt the spectacle or epic drama they were hoping for and unfortunately they were right. Certainly not a terrible movie, but one that is just about average.Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb."
"Napoleon","petra_ste","3 December 2023",610,"Ridley Scott directed one of the best movies ever made set during the Napoleonic Wars: unfortunately, that movie is not Napoleon but his cinematic debut, The Duellists, forty years ago.Unsurprisingly, The Duellists had a strong source material (it was based on a novel by Joseph Conrad which it often followed almost verbatim), while Napoleon has an uneven screenplay by David Scarpa.Even past the age of eighty Sir Ridley can still shoot pretty and energetic pictures but his hits and misses depend on the scripts he picks, and he hasn't always shown the best discernment.The elephant in the room is the large amount of historical inaccuracies. Even as a history buff I can forgive many of those: cutting or simplifying events for the sake of narrative, or even some overdramatization like the meeting between Napoleon and Wellington (it never happened) or Napoleon being present at Marie Antoinette's execution (he wasn't); however, stuff like Napoleon charging with his troops at Waterloo is absolute cringe, a kid's (or a lout's) idea of history.Still, the big problems here are characterization and pacing.The movie is a demythologization (some would say emasculation) of Napoleon. If you want to take this route then fair enough, but the character here fails to be consistent. I can buy a Napoleon who is an egomaniac and an overrated tactician (like in Tolstoy's War and Peace). I do not buy one who is an anxious, insecure, uncharismatic cold fish but also a stern tactical genius and an effective leader of men, one who flees from Egypt because Josephine is unfaithful but is also an unflappable military mastermind.Phoenix is a great actor and does what he can but the two sides of the character just don't gel with each other. You can't have parodic moments like Napoleon rolling down the stairs during his coup against the Directory, despondently pouting as he waits for the rain to stop at Waterloo or awkwardly climbing on a box to stand face to face with a pharaoh's mummy (with his diminutive stature becoming a not-too-subtle metaphor of his overall mediocrity)... AND THEN have him magnetically charm the French soldiers into obedience after the Elba. This gawky Napoleon would have been shot to pieces there.The other problem is pacing. A single movie about the whole life of Napoleon is in itself absurd, like making ""a movie about World War 2"". There is material in Napoleon's life for a VERY dense miniseries (which Steven Spielberg is reportedly planning).Napoleon's first wife Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) plays a huge role here but I would argue the movie has either too little or way too much of her. This needed to be either focused mostly on Napoleon's personal life or to drastically reduce the (fairly repetitive after a while) moments where Napoleon is obsessed with his wife.As it is now, it tries to tell - but rushes through - twenty very eventful years of European history and yet devotes more time to Napoleon visiting Josephine after their divorce than to his Russian campaign.It's like making a D-Day movie which keeps cutting back and forth from the Normandy landings to Hitler spending time with Eva Braun. You can have either The Longest Day or Der Untergang, not both.Still, it's not worthless. There are some interesting moments and set-pieces and, while Phoenix is saddled with a contradictory character, Kirby at least is excellent.6/10."
"Napoleon","MissSimonetta","25 November 2023",210,"Ridley Scott's NAPOLEON feels like the highlight reel of a lengthy miniseries. Considering there's a 4-hour cut of this film, that explains it all.NAPOLEON is certainly good spectacle. The battle scenes are breathtaking. Unfortunately, it's also shallow. I know Scott has sneered at viewers criticizing the historical inaccuracies in the film, but I'm more bothered by a total lack of interesting character psychology or even coherent storytelling. Characters pop in and out, leaving little impression in their brief scenes. Relationships between characters are barely fleshed out, including that of Napoleon and Josephine, which dominates the running time. Also, potentially unpopular opinion, I thought Joaquin Phoenix's performance was a one-note bore.Perhaps the 4-hour version is a richer piece of work. As is, NAPOLEON is a let down, especially after Scott's brilliant 2021 period piece THE LAST DUEL, which had all the drama and psychological depth this movie lacked."
"Napoleon","dhunjiwadia","26 November 2023",510,"Ridley Scott's Napoleon is more hysterical than historical. History is like an uninvited guest in this movie. Stunning battle visuals don't make up for gross historical approximations.If you want to watch a masterpiece then see Waterloo, with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. And if you want a historical enumeration then watch the Napoleon series with Christian Clavier, Isabella Rossalini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu.This movie was made for Apple streaming. Then they made a butchered version for cinema to be able to compete for the Oscars. The original Apple streaming version will be at least 2 hours longer. This cut version for cinema is somewhat rushed, disjointed and, as a result, confusing.We never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful and won the admiration of so many. Here it's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in reality, over here he's shown as a childish brute. The focus was more on set pieces and his relationship with Josephine.Joaquin Phoenix can play odd or troubled characters well. Here he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. He's too old for this role (Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined) and made the character seem bizarre than a charismatic leader. Vanessa Kirby as Josephine gets more traction.The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is of a very high order. The battle scenes are filmed well. Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes slick and impressive. But overall it's a below average movie. Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie."
"Napoleon","krzysiektom","26 November 2023",210,"What a disappointment. This film is BORING. A movie with a huge budget, good actors, about a person as fascinating and complex as Bonaparte, who participated in more than 60 battles and had drama, triumphs and failures that would be enough for a few lifetimes, is... BORING! Nothing is well explained, it's unclear who is who beside Napoleon and Josephine. Several unnecessary sex scenes between the two. What's even worse is that it's unclear why the French nation would follow and worship this Napoleon as he's portrayed in this movie, because in this movie he seems a mediocre personality, without much charisma or extraordinary abilities. In addition, everything on the screen looks greyish blue, without vivid colors, and it is a bit depressing. I liked only two elements of this movie: musical score and costumes."
"Napoleon","levybob","2 December 2023",410,"I read the reviews of Ridley Scott's 'Napoleon' and knew it was not the great film everyone anticipated. Even so, I went. And what I discovered is that it's bad in the worst kind of way; It is dull. Lifeless. A flat un-involving story about characters who are in every way unlikable. Another reviewer wrote that he / she had trouble staying awake through its 2 hours 40 minutes run-time. When I read that I laughed. Now that I have seen the film, I am laughing no longer.Napoleon Bonaparte as Emperor of France did a lot of good things; much of the country's 'Civil Code' was instituted during his reign. But this film deals only with (a) Napoleon the warrior and (b) Napoleon the husband, and fails to deliver a well-rounded character in either sense. We know he loves France but aside from living there we don't know what drives his passion. His hatred for anything not France is clear, but the reasons for this hatred are never explained. There are battles a'plenty but the reason for them is elusive. Enemies become friends. Friends become enemies. We care about none of them. Thousands die. Somehow we care nothing about them either.There is, in Napoleon, no one to root for. Making matters worse there is an uneven performance by Joaquin Phoenix. His 'later' Napoleon becomes a different character than we'd seen earlier in the film. And no, I don't think it is attributed to Napoleon's rise in power. I think it's Phoenix; his acting, his portrayal. His Napoleon is far less quirky as the film progresses (as though the actor wants out of his role), and in this way, he is far less interesting.If there's anyone about whom we do care that character would be Josephine, Napoleon's wife and Empress of France. Vanessa Kirby is ravishing in the role. A rare beauty but one with a shadow-filled past as well as future. We can understand Napoleon's undying love her but the truth is, she's not the nicest girl on the block. There's little doubt that Mr. Bonaparte would never have 'won' her, were he not the country's future leader. So, again, no one to truly root for.Ah, yes. The battle scenes. They're fine (though it seems as though a battle fought at the base of Egypt's pyramids was cut out). But I think fewer battles and more unraveling of the reasons behind those battles between France, England, Russia, Austria, and other countries might make the remaining battles more meaningful.More involving.Which, as I said, this film is definitely not."
"Napoleon","Eleatic67","2 March 2024",610,"The success of any film depends mostly on the script. Why Scott would initiate such an expensive project without ensuring a refined and sophisticated script is a mystery. I'm not convinced there is a single interesting scene that provides insight into the characters or captures through language the prevailing political ideas. Scott's frequent missteps as a director reflect a greater interest in the cinematic rather than in the dramatic. However, this seems inevitable when your priority is delivering a blockbuster that will have broad appeal instead of digging deeper into culture, society, or history. A colossal waste of an extraordinary opportunity to create an important film about a fascinating historical figure."
"Napoleon","Vic_max","22 November 2023",610,"Many of Ridley Scott's movies are like visual masterpieces with epic storylines. I was sort of expecting something like Gladiator. Instead, it was just ""meh"" - I probably would have quit watching if it was on TV.Joaquin Phoenix has demonstrated that he can play odd or troubled characters well, but I don't think he was a good choice for Napoleon. He made the character seem more bizarre than charismatic or leader-like. I think the strongest and most interesting character was actually Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) ... who will probably get the most traction from the movie.The story itself wasn't that interesting because it wasn't explained that well. For example, his departure from Elba island seemed to randomly happen without much explanation. The elevation to a monarch-like role also happens without much explanation. It's like you're watching snippets of a bigger, more interesting story.I become so disconnected from the story that I almost fell asleep during some of the long battle sequences.The movie would probably have been better if it captured just one pivotal event or time period ... or better yet, if it had been a miniseries. While I will still look forward to any future movie from Scott, Napoleon deserved better."
"Napoleon","epicking","23 November 2023",310,"Im only focused on the historical aspect here ... and I only mentions a couple of out many hereIn the beginning, Napoleon abandons a battle at the Egyptian pyramids because Joséphine is unfaithful at home in Paris. It is pure fiction.Much later, when the two have divorced, he marches on Paris from his famous exile on the island of Elba, because he is jealous that the Russian Tsar Alexander is apparently taking a swing with Joséphine. From whom Napoleon, by the way, has long since divorced.It is a distortion of history of the worst kind. Joséphine dies of pneumonia in 1814. Napoleon first marches on Paris in 1815 to regain power, a wild story that could be a whole movie in itself.If you´re gonna make an expensive movie like this, get things right instead of just making romantic stuff up."
"Napoleon","LongTimeMovieLover","23 November 2023",410,"First, let me get this out of the way. If you want to watch a focused masterpiece, watch Waterloo with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. It could have only been better (for me) if Steiger had a French accent. Second, if you want to watch a general scoping history of Napoleon, consider the excellent and approachable Napoleon series with Christian Clavier (with a French accent), Isabella Rossallini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu. (Clavier is sometimes unfairly maligned when indeed he does a splendid job in my view.) There are other well-reputed less approachable versions, but these two are excellent.Now, as this work, let's start with Napoleon. A boyishly handsome, philosophically grounded (Napoleonic Code), egotistical, pugnacious genius, sometimes brooding sometimes loving, sometimes playing. That is, a strategically gifted, tactically trained, boyishly handsome, egotistical, passionate, lovable, fighting, moody, young genius.I am sorry, but this character requires someone like a young Brando or Pacino. Phoenix simply cannot, no-way, pull it off. Way wrong. Crazy wrong. He does not have the range. He is a great actor only in a particular type of role, a crouching villainous Caesar or a depressive Joker. A melancholic low-key whispering introverted Napoleon does not work, and some form of delusion by Scott allowed or put Phoenix into this role. I can easily get past failure of boyish good looks and the way wrong age (and Napoleon's young age is part of the story itself). But I cannot get past whispering tone and failure of charisma, passion and charm. Napoleon seduced a lot of people in a lot of ways.It's not Phoenix's fault he was miscast. Way miscast. Vanessa Kirby was fine and did her job. But, no one in this movie deserves any acting nominations. Take one common scene, being the ""Will you shoot your emperor?"" following Napoleon's escape from Elba and return to France, the other referenced Napoleons had timing, tension, and drama, here blah, nothing. Nothing! It's just bad. Really bad.Nothing in this movie taught me anything, made me think, made me feel, or moved me in any way. Terribly unengaging. Even the couple attempts at comic relief (if there would have been any tension, which was devoid) it was misplaced and failed miserably.Now, let's talk about the versions. This is the 2.5H version and there is another 4H version to be released by Apple+. Everything is a gimmick these days. Every streaming channel has one gem, but I'll suggest this work is inherently flawed by miscast Phoenix and more time to blend the scenes won't do it. In this 2.5H version, it's like a bunch of scenes without any context. We go from the French Revolution through the Reign of Terror through Napoleon's coup through Austerlitz through first defeat through Elba through return to France through Waterloo, through St. Helena. In 2.5H, even with the right actor who has engaging charisma and charm, it's too much ground. No character development whatsoever. None. Even in 4H it's like getting two bad suits for the price of one. It's just more of what's bad, which is miscast Phoenix in the titular role. I only understood the movie because I love and know the history. My wife and 86 year old father could not follow it, and my 19 year old daughter (somewhat tired from returning from college) dozed off a couple of times. No one liked the movie. And we even went out of our way to the IMAX because, well, it was Napoleon.I almost forgot to mention the emasculation of Napoleon by Josephine, the jarring politically correct now-required social normalizing casting of extras, and the ending credits that count the dead but give no context for the concomitant social reforms.Braveheart was historically all wrong, but it was still a great story with a wonderful score. This Napoleon is a bad story, and, even if Napoleon was a fictional character it was still bad. It's both a bad reflection of a real man, a grossly incomplete historical depiction, and a bad story poorly told no matter what.Napoleon was loved, hated, admired and ridiculed, by many of the same people, at different times. He was, if nothing else, one of the greatest characters in the recorded history of mankind. To try to do it all fairly, with the wrong titular actor, is silly. Really silly. Delusively silly.Sir Ridley's movie The Last Duel failed for a similar reason, and then he blames the audience. It's not the production or even perhaps the precise movie direction that is going wrong, it's that the story itself is not well-told. Perhaps it's time for him to teach his tactical craft to a young person with the right vision for the story expression.I need to watch my Waterloo DVD again to get my head back to the right flavor of Napoleon the Great, not Napoleon the Whisperer.Nothing good, new or better. A waste of my time and money."

When anyone thinks about Napolean, they automatically think of the general, the egomaniacal conquerer, military genius who glorified and unified France after the French Revolution.So going into an ""epic"" 2 hour and 40 minute movie, you would safely assume we'd get a glimpse into that twisted, genius mind, especially from an actor like Phoenix, right?Wrong. Instead we get practically a two hour, unoriginal portrait of his banal relationship with Josephine; yes, the rest of the 45 minutes are indeed battles that were good, not great. The lopsided focus on Josephine is unwarranted and unjustified, merely because we didn't learn anything new that we couldn't already assume if it only featured a half hour with their relationship on screen. Honestly, I still cannot fathom any point in that narrative decision after enduring it, as again, there were no twists or startling revelations; if the point was to just humanize Napoleon, we get it, he had a wife and dealt with her toxicity.The best part of the entire movie was the very end when the biographical title cards came up and revealed what a bloodlusting monster he really was, with the visceral explanation of the vast amount of lives he lost in his vain conquests. Back then, the world population was exponentially less than today. Three million in less than twenty years over 61 campaigns, with the Russian incursion costing three hundred plus thousand alone, seventy thousand at Waterloo. It's a shame that most of the tone of the movie not only was wasted on his love life, but moreso did not depict him as the maniacal sociopath he clearly was.On a side note, since we're delving into European French history and this piece failed to capture the period well enough, future filmmakers should hone in on the actual French Revolution. Tale of Two Cities, anyone? Nolan would crush it!4.5/10."
"Napoleon","malmevik77","25 November 2023",210,"NapoleonLet's start with the good things. The battle scenes are well shot, exciting, horrifying, the excellent work one can expect from a Ridley Scott movie.Josephine was fantastic. Her situation was clearly not ideal, and the actress portrayed her in such a way that I felt more for her than anyone else in the film.Now the bad things. All of it. This movie was not good at all. It was such a disappointment. This film had major problems with the flow of the story. It was extremely disjointed. I had no understanding of what was happening as it felt like someone took an outline and only filmed the bullet points, and not the detail beneath it. There is no transition from the coup in 1799 to the coronation in 1804. There is no explanation. There is no context as to how and why this was even acceptable.And don't get me started on historical inaccuracies. The very first scene shows Marie Antoinette getting beheaded in 1789 when that amazing invention called google can tell you otherwise.Maybe I'm being a bit harsh but I've studied English and French history quite extensively and it was cringe worthy to watch. Joaquin Phoenix was also very much miscast. I felt sorry for Vanessa Kirby as she was the highlight of the film. In all honesty, this film should have been called Josephine.I do not recommend watching this unless you're just there for the well shot battle scenes. The lake scene will give you chills. This film was a huge disappointment and I felt embarrassed for the filmmakers."
"Napoleon","itsahoverboard","23 November 2023",510,"Yes, that's a real quote from Joaquin Phoenix to Ridley Scott right before they started filming. I love Joaquin Phoenix, but you can really tell that he doesn't ""get"" the character of Napoleon that he's trying to play. I honestly don't know if Phoenix even has that kind of charisma and confidence within him, but then again I don't know anything about Napoleon either. But it was just uncomfortable watching him stumble his way through the movie, often just looking clueless.The other problem with the movie is it's just plain dull and uninteresting. It really does feel like a ""highlights"" movie. For an almost 3-hour film, it has surprisingly little dialogue. The dialogue that's there isn't' that illuminating or interesting. I normally like politics and romance (which is the bulk of this story), but I would have loved to see more military and war stuff in a movie like this. Isn't Napoleon supposed to be a brilliant war leader? There's like none of that here. Except ""oh we'll do a sneak attack in the night.""The cinematography was also really surprisingly dull. It looked super digital. The colors were so bland and washed out.Vanessa Kirby is really the best thing about the movie. And also the first battle taking over that fort, which was admittedly pretty epic. I have never seen such a thing happen to a horse in a movie, and it was wonderfully horrifying.I fully blame Ridley Scott for this dud. Hopefully Spielberg's Kubrick miniseries about Napoleon will be much better."
"Napoleon","zeki-4","22 November 2023",710,"Back in 2005 Ridley Scott's 144 minute version of 'Kingdom of Heaven' premiered in theatres to somewhat mixed reviews. A couple of years later the vastly superior 190 minute director's cut version finally arrived, with the general consensus that the final product was a masterclass in storytelling, directing, acting and cinematography. - without doubt the best motion picture ever made about the crusades.Almost 20 years later we are yet again treated with a compiled highlight reel of a Ridley Scott movie in the theatre, rather than a full-fledged historical epic, since it has already become official that 'Napoleon' will be released later on streaming with its entire runtime of almost four hours, which clearly is needed to flesh out many parts of the movie and fill in the emotional and historical blanks, because this - somewhat butchered cut - moves in a breakneck speed and feels too rushed.Whereas the underappreciated 1970 movie 'Waterloo' starring Rod Steiger as Napoleon Bonaparte, featuring thousands of extras, portrayed events only during the 100 days campaign in 1815, Scott's 'Napoleon' takes us through decades of various major events and battles beginning with the siege of Toulon in 1793. In this version we never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful. Why did he win the admiration of so many? It's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in real life, but here he is portrayed as a childish brute? It felt like the focus was more on setpieces and his troubled relationship with Josephine, than on him as a ruthless and cunning emperor, and in the theatre cut there really isn't a lot of places where Joaquin Phoenix truly shines as an Oscar contender. Maybe the director's cut will remedy that.In spite of its shortcomings (no pun intended) 'Napoleon' is still one of the best movies I have seen this year, but I am baffled. Because if people can sit through 3+ hour box office hits like 'Avengers Endgame', 'Avatar 2' and 'Oppenheimer' - why the need to release just a very extended trailer of 'Napoleon' in the theatre, especially when everyone know that they can just wait a couple of months for it to arrive on streaming in its entirety? An attempt by Apple at a cash grab? ""You need a subscription to our streaming service to watch the whole thing""?With that being said, I do predict some Oscar nominations here. Ridley Scott yet again proves why he is one of the best filmmakers out there. But a word of caution: If you only plan to see this once, you might consider waiting for the director's cut."
"Napoleon","gcarpiceci","22 November 2023",510,"History is an undesired guest taking the backseat in Mr Scott's sprawling epic on Napoleon's life.Mr Scott's craftsmanship is such that it's undoubtedly able to offer the viewer some unique experiences. But stunning battle visuals and great performances by the lead actors don't make up for gross historical approximation.I have no doubt whatsoever that Mr Scott knows his history and, if he didn't, he surely has a fat staff of assistants to tell it to him; so what he does here (as he did already in Gladiator) is a very deliberate and blatant choice to bend historical reality to the purposes of his own art, which looks like an act of unforgivable artistic hubris."
"Napoleon","richard-1787","27 November 2023",310,"This movie must have cost a fortune to make. (There is no budget listed yet here on IMDB.) You would think they could have spent a little of it on a good script. So many of the problems here stem from the bad script, which does not provide clues about what it going on.What we get is several large-scale but very unexciting battle scenes, where we watch the infantry march into suicidal battle, sometimes led by the cavalry, sometimes followed. In a movie about a fabled tactician, there is no discussion of what made him a success, what he did differently, etc.In between the battle episodes are some of the least romantic, un-erotic love scenes ever filmed. Phoenix and his leading lady have absolutely NO chemistry whatsoever. Half the time he is like a statue with her, the other half like an over-eager dog. We never get a hint of what he might see in her.I stayed through the whole 2.5 hours because I was with friends. Otherwise I would have left mid-way through, or fallen asleep - as Napoleon does several times himself during the battle scenes.I saw Oppenheimer, which is a full three hours long, three times last summer, and was riveted to it all three times. That movie was well directed. This movie didn't hold me at all, had no pacing, and was sometimes confusing even though I have studied that period of French history.Some will find fault with historical inaccuracies. There are evidently a fair number of them. But that doesn't bother me. What bothered me was that Scott and his crew never made this story come alive. Why spend all that money and all those resources on something that just is not interesting?"
"Napoleon","rachelnstephens","22 November 2023",410,"If I knew nothing of Napoleon, I'd be utterly confused about what was happening in this film. There is no hero's journey to follow and nobody to root for.Who is Napoleon? Why is he in France? How did he get to his position? The film begins with the death of Marie Antoinette and pretty much dives right into Napoleon being in charge somehow. Why Napoleon? No idea.Early on we meet Josephine's minor son who is never seen again on screen after a one-on-one meeting with Napoleon. Why does Napoleon meet with him? Why does he grant his request? Why is he interested in Josephine? No idea.The film feels as if you're a time traveller who is moving forward to different snapshots of Napoleon's life. There's little context or explanation. Lots of battle scenes, troop movement, flag signaling and even smelting to make munitions but not a lot of context. Why is Napoleon going here or there? No idea. What is his end goal? No idea. Why do Napoleon's men have an affinity for him? No idea.There are large spans of time between scenes so suddenly Josephine's daughter is a grown adult speaking with Napoleon. No clue who she was until Napoleon mentioned Josephine being her mother. Who are all of these people? No idea. How are they connected? No idea.The film is beautifully shot. The costuming is perfection. The set design is dreamy. Nobody can say that Ridley Scott doesn't know how to make a movie or that Joaquin Phoenix isn't a fantastic actor - it's simply a poor script."
"Napoleon","WadoodS","22 November 2023",510,"Making a movie on a charismatic person like Napoleon is a huge undertaking. It requires in-depth study of his life and then choosing specific events of his life to show and connecting them to perfection. The film maker is short in time therefore it is important for the movie to be precise, fluent and with a purpose. In this movie, the director, Ridley Scott, fails to determine which points of his life he wishes to portray and consequently it results in a piece-by-piece movie which lacks cinematic flow and confuses the audience.The movie disappoints in showing the battles, only briefly does it show the battles of Toulon and Austerlitz and then a bit longer Waterloo, of course concentrating more on Wellington's genius rather than Napoleon's side of things, where there is no mention of Marshal Grouchy's failed mission to block Blucher's army from joining the battle.As great an actor as Joaquin Phoenix is, he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. I felt like Napoleon was intentionally mimicked by the film maker to portray him as a socially awkward person who does not know his way around women, or even his soldiers who loved him so much. During the coup d'etat he is seen as a confused ""coward"" who escapes for his life and is only saved by the cleverness of his brother. But I have personally grown up around military personnel who are calm and composed in the face of adversity and prudently handle critical situations which makes it even more incredible that a military genius of Napoleon's stature would cower under pressure.Joaquin Phoenix's character lacks fundamental personal charisma which is so evident in leaders in general, and military leaders specifically. The movie fails to communicate why then the most civilized, liberal people on the planet earth during that time followed this uncharismatic, bland leader in 61 of his battles? French had already beheaded their king, and all French men were citizens with equal rights - at least only men. No other country in Europe has achieved this level of self-consciousness for human freedom at that time. There is also no mention of his civil, political, artistic achievements like the Code Napoleon or the great artists that flourished under him.Joaquin Phoenix is himself or rather he is still in his Joker character. Apparently, he didn't try enough to get into Napoleon's character. Look at Marlon Brando for example, who shines in his role as Napoleon. Joaquin is so one dimensional who seems to be asleep all the time and has no idea what he is doing while the real Napoleon was an energetic, charismatic, young, and quick individual.I tried to get over his age difference as he is too old to portray such a young person. Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined. He was 35 when he was crowned Emperor of the French. Joaquin Phoenix looks in his fifties in the whole movie. Vanessa Kirby's young age doesn't help much as Josephine was 6 years older. Vanessa Kirby plays brilliantly in her role and dominated every scene she was in as a cold, unfaithful, and then heart-broken queen.It was a brilliant opportunity wasted by the film makers. It could have been much better - as the brilliant life story is already there. The music could have been better. They should have used one of those music/sound directors Christopher Nolan uses in his movies. The cinematography was very good though. The battle scenes were filmed well. My friend pointed out that the cinematographer found his favorite angle on Vaness Kirby when they were in their private bedroom. I laughed more at this joke than at any ""funny"" moments in the movie. Overall, it is a below average movie. Don't go there with your hopes held high. I think Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie. Now I am not sure I will watch the director's cut. I am looking forward to a young, energetic director taking this enterprise and making a Braveheart-like movie."
"Napoleon","M_Exchange","22 November 2023",510,"As many of you know, Stanley Kubrick was obsessed with Napoleon, and he wanted to make his magnum opus about him near the end of his life. He never got around to it. I would have loved to have seen that film.This film is not a total disappointment, but it's far from great. I fell in love with its visuals, and I felt as if I was in the era of the 1790's/early 1800's. Its war scenes are good. Also, I appreciate that it does not hit the three hour mark, but it felt choppy and often incomplete. For instance, when Napoleon got punished a couple of times for his defeats one might think that he cut straight from a loss to a meeting with foreign dignitaries. In actuality, things were much messier in between.I never really felt a romantic spark between him and his first wife, and I never really felt much emotion ever throughout the entirety of the film. Even his death was rather anticlimactic and weak.I would recommend this film only to French people and history buffs."
"Napoleon","dorMancyx","22 November 2023",610,"I feel unsatisfied walking out of that theater after three hours of melancholy and confusion. I understand every single word and every single scene, but when they connect into a whole film I don't understand anything. To start off, the costume/production design, naturalistic sceneries, the two meticulously-depicted ancient warfares --- one amid the doleful squall of Austerlitz and another atop the dampened prairie of Waterloo --- and all other technical stuff are spotless. However, there's an anxiety-inducing problem with the narrative --- the movie has no focus. No climax, no resonating themes like Oppenheimer, just one plain, linear, chronological plot; and even that we get multiple baffling time jumps throughout. The plot is so simple that everything in the film was taught in my AP World History class last year in one day, except it nibbles on some superficial details. Highlighting the relationship between Napolean and Josephine is a unique take, and I do see efforts from the two esteemed performers to capture their mutual toxicity and intricacy, but this love story has barely anything to do with the movie's main arc, Napolean's personal rise and fall. Nothing! Two basically unrelated storylines unfolding in the most bland way possible. Also adding to this insipid mess is the score, which is composed primarily of classical or really old-sounding French folk --- what happened to Radiohead from the trailer? God Ridley I don't wanna say three hours of my life is wasted but it kinda is!I didn't think it was possible but, I think Oppenheimer's winning the Oscar."
"Napoleon","theRetiree","22 November 2023",410,"Just came from a full theater. At the end we got up and left in dead silence. No plot except broad strokes of history, little dialog, no passion, Phoenix seemed catatonic, and the movie was nothing more than set pieces posed to look like romantic paintings by Jacques-Louis David (who actually conveyed more emotion and spirit ). The early climax was Austerlitz, which Scott tried to stage as a replay of the destruction of the Teutonic Knights in Alexander.Nevsky. Wikipedia says maybe two of three soldiers (of thousands of casualties) died in the frozen ponds.Waterloo was equally lame, with French cavalry trying unsuccessfully to break the British Squares looking ridiculously like Plains Indians riding in circles attacking a wagon train. (Mel Brooks staged that better.) And Blucher's timely last minute arrival (which Wellington described as a ""near run thing"") had no tension and no suspense.Beautiful costumes and sets, a case of thousands, but unsatisfying either as historical spectacle or grand love affair, with Phoenix and the director both giving new meaning to the expression ""phoning it in."""
"Napoleon","jozenerd","26 November 2023",310,"During this movie, I just felt like watching a Monty Python's version of Napoleon or a BBC special based on a flyer they took on a train station about Napoleon's affairs and life troubles. Once again, Scott is making out his version of the history or the history that goes with his religion and political views. About Joaquin Phoenix's acting, it's sometimes laughable ala Eddie Redmayne on Jupiter Ascending, Halle Berry on Catwoman, or Marion Cotillard's death scene on Batman, that bad!!! Gosh, this movie is a reminder of past glories that are far gone and Mr. Scott is not deceiving me once again. He did it once with Covenant, guess who did it again? Not Britney!"
"Napoleon","nlcckc","23 November 2023",210,"So here is a film about one of the greatest warlords of history, and what do you suppose it emphasizes? If your guess is the yucky ""relationship"" he had with Josephine, you're not far from the truth.Here's what this movie contains:

"Napoleon","OwneyH","23 November 2023",110,"This was one of the worst big budget movies I have ever seen. I made it toward the later half of the movie and everyone had already walked out, I decided to also walk out. It was the first film I ever walked out on. Here is why:Napoleon opens with what is seemingly going to be a historical biography film adaptation of Napoleon's life, what you instead get is a poorly made, half attempt at a comedy. That's not an exaggeration, it really does play out like a half attempted comedy that's neither funny nor entertaining.It starts in the French Revolution, the first problems was Joaquin Phoenix. I never thought he was a bad actor, but he's bad in this movie. Not only is he a bad Napoleon, not only is he way older looking than actual Napoleon (who is supposed to be 24 at the start of the film), but it's like he didn't even wanna play the role. I don't know what he was going for here but what we got is a bumbling fool with no confidence in any regard, no sign of intelligence, no backstory, no character development, no knowledge of his life outside of his marriage, and above all no historical accuracy whatsoever.This isn't only Joaquin Phoenix's fault, it's Ridley Scott and writer David Scarpa too. Everyone failed this project.If what you were looking for is a film about the Napoleonic Wars, look elsewhere. There is almost no war in it, and what little war there was, is only little clips of warfare, and then straight back to Napoleon's marriage life. Even if you found the marriage stuff interesting about Napoleon, this still isn't the movie for you, because it's not accurate and the film makes it's point early on, but for some reason they keep going over the same ground already covered about Napoleon's love life. It get's very repetitive and quite frankly, boring.These clips of combat we get are completely disconnected from the story, it looks like it's randomly thrown in. They're also really short. If you remember, the trailer has combat in Egypt. You see all that combat in the trailer, that's it. There's no more of it. The trailer was better than the movie.As a history buff (especially history on the French Revolution/Napoleonic Wars) and a film buff, it comes off as offensive to the entire subject matter it's covering in history, offensive to the entire art form of filmmaking, and offensive to the intelligence of it's viewer.It takes nothing seriously, all these huge events regardless of your opinion is treated with disrespect.But most historical events are absent from this film. It focuses so heavily on this marriage story that you don't care about it because the film never tried to make you care, to the point where you feel shocked to see how much time has passed and how many events they skipped when you finally see a date pop up on the screen or an actual recognizable event.Or if you don't know Napoleonic history, you will be entirely lost as to what's happening because it explains nothing, it doesn't even mention why the Napoleonic Wars is happening at all. It doesn't even cover Napoleon growing as a general. Or even growing as a person. The look of Napoleon is even lazily done in this.This version of Napoleon is such a fool instead of a smart general, he makes Napoleon Dynamite look like a cool, collected, Chad.From a film making perspective, the movie is horribly made, generic to bad camera work, a bland soundtrack, HORRIBLE writing, a plot that goes nowhere.The only positives I can find is that some of the costume design is good, the sets are pretty well made, and the one scene in the trailer with the ice was cool. But I'd say watch the trailer again instead of the movie. But that's it. Those are the only good things.If you like Napoleon you won't like this, if you hate Napoleon you won't like this. If you like history you won't like this. If you don't care about history you won't like this. It's poorly made and boring for all. Find any other Napoleon focused movie and I'm sure it will be more entertaining.The trailer makes it seem like a different movie. I feel scammed, I feel lied to.A history film about the Napoleonic Wars with no history, no Napoleonic Wars, and an inaccurate Napoleon that's not fun to watch and at times straight up cringe to witness, makes this movie a solid 1. No entertainment value."
"Napoleon","gmznffvs","22 November 2023",310,"Napoleon is one of the greatest characters in history. He came out of the ashes of the French Revolution to not only lead the country but to inspire it. People were given new hope, aspirations and above all opportunities.Bonaparte created the first meritocracy in Europe. Ordinary people rose to positions of significance in the arts, sciences and all walks of life. In his army almost all the generals came from ordinary backgrounds, whereas pre the Revolution they were aristos.Not one person who doesn't know about Napoleon will know any of this when they come out of the movie.There is nothing to give an insight to his motivation Hint, it wasn't all for Josephine. There was no politics. None of the brilliant generals who fought with him get a look in. Bernadot was invited to be king of Sweden! Talleyrand was a self serving rat, but here is a nobody.Even the election of his brothers to the thrones of other European countries is not worth a mention.Napoleon enjoyed his power. Phoenix mopes about with his usual stone face making every day seem a chore.The only good part, worth the three stars is Waterloo, which is a good battle scene, if not by any means perfect, but watching the move from line to square was satisfying.Now people will think this morose dull man was Napoleon. How could he have been? Why would the French have loved him? Why would they welcome him back.What a disappointment."
"Napoleon","imseeg","23 November 2023",610,"A word of warning for those expecting another Gladiator or non stop action spectacle. It is not. Truly not...The bad: director Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes look slick and impressive (and he does an excellent job again), but he is also known for being quite average at making a drama. And this movie tries (and partly fails) to combine action and drama and somehow ends up being neither one. THAT is one of the reasons I'll only rate it with 6 stars.More bad: this story has a weak ""dramatic"" middle (love story) part, which is kinda tedious. And that brings me to a storyline complaint, namely that this story is all over the place. They cram SO much events and history and different characters from different time periods into this one movie that it kinda confused and numbed me down, instead of thrilling me, as an epic should do.This movie was made for Apple streaming (release date january 2024) in the first place, but they made a shorter (butchered) version for the cinemas in order to be able to compete for the Oscars, which demands that a movie must have run in the cinemas for a couple of weeks. No cinema version, no Oscars.The original Apple streaming version lasted some 2 hours longer. Nobody is gonna sit in the cinema for over 4 hours, hence they cut this movie up and now it feels somewhat rushed, confusing and disjointed at certain moments.Not any good then? Joaquin Phoenix is the one redeeming feature. He nails it.. He makes Napoleon look like a complete joke of a man and I love Joaquin Phoenix' performance, but that unfortunately didnt compensate for the other actors being just about average and with little actor's chemistry between them.I had been warned beforehand by friends that this wasnt the spectacle or epic drama they were hoping for and unfortunately they were right. Certainly not a terrible movie, but one that is just about average.Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb."
"Napoleon","petra_ste","3 December 2023",610,"Ridley Scott directed one of the best movies ever made set during the Napoleonic Wars: unfortunately, that movie is not Napoleon but his cinematic debut, The Duellists, forty years ago.Unsurprisingly, The Duellists had a strong source material (it was based on a novel by Joseph Conrad which it often followed almost verbatim), while Napoleon has an uneven screenplay by David Scarpa.Even past the age of eighty Sir Ridley can still shoot pretty and energetic pictures but his hits and misses depend on the scripts he picks, and he hasn't always shown the best discernment.The elephant in the room is the large amount of historical inaccuracies. Even as a history buff I can forgive many of those: cutting or simplifying events for the sake of narrative, or even some overdramatization like the meeting between Napoleon and Wellington (it never happened) or Napoleon being present at Marie Antoinette's execution (he wasn't); however, stuff like Napoleon charging with his troops at Waterloo is absolute cringe, a kid's (or a lout's) idea of history.Still, the big problems here are characterization and pacing.The movie is a demythologization (some would say emasculation) of Napoleon. If you want to take this route then fair enough, but the character here fails to be consistent. I can buy a Napoleon who is an egomaniac and an overrated tactician (like in Tolstoy's War and Peace). I do not buy one who is an anxious, insecure, uncharismatic cold fish but also a stern tactical genius and an effective leader of men, one who flees from Egypt because Josephine is unfaithful but is also an unflappable military mastermind.Phoenix is a great actor and does what he can but the two sides of the character just don't gel with each other. You can't have parodic moments like Napoleon rolling down the stairs during his coup against the Directory, despondently pouting as he waits for the rain to stop at Waterloo or awkwardly climbing on a box to stand face to face with a pharaoh's mummy (with his diminutive stature becoming a not-too-subtle metaphor of his overall mediocrity)... AND THEN have him magnetically charm the French soldiers into obedience after the Elba. This gawky Napoleon would have been shot to pieces there.The other problem is pacing. A single movie about the whole life of Napoleon is in itself absurd, like making ""a movie about World War 2"". There is material in Napoleon's life for a VERY dense miniseries (which Steven Spielberg is reportedly planning).Napoleon's first wife Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) plays a huge role here but I would argue the movie has either too little or way too much of her. This needed to be either focused mostly on Napoleon's personal life or to drastically reduce the (fairly repetitive after a while) moments where Napoleon is obsessed with his wife.As it is now, it tries to tell - but rushes through - twenty very eventful years of European history and yet devotes more time to Napoleon visiting Josephine after their divorce than to his Russian campaign.It's like making a D-Day movie which keeps cutting back and forth from the Normandy landings to Hitler spending time with Eva Braun. You can have either The Longest Day or Der Untergang, not both.Still, it's not worthless. There are some interesting moments and set-pieces and, while Phoenix is saddled with a contradictory character, Kirby at least is excellent.6/10."
"Napoleon","MissSimonetta","25 November 2023",210,"Ridley Scott's NAPOLEON feels like the highlight reel of a lengthy miniseries. Considering there's a 4-hour cut of this film, that explains it all.NAPOLEON is certainly good spectacle. The battle scenes are breathtaking. Unfortunately, it's also shallow. I know Scott has sneered at viewers criticizing the historical inaccuracies in the film, but I'm more bothered by a total lack of interesting character psychology or even coherent storytelling. Characters pop in and out, leaving little impression in their brief scenes. Relationships between characters are barely fleshed out, including that of Napoleon and Josephine, which dominates the running time. Also, potentially unpopular opinion, I thought Joaquin Phoenix's performance was a one-note bore.Perhaps the 4-hour version is a richer piece of work. As is, NAPOLEON is a let down, especially after Scott's brilliant 2021 period piece THE LAST DUEL, which had all the drama and psychological depth this movie lacked."
"Napoleon","dhunjiwadia","26 November 2023",510,"Ridley Scott's Napoleon is more hysterical than historical. History is like an uninvited guest in this movie. Stunning battle visuals don't make up for gross historical approximations.If you want to watch a masterpiece then see Waterloo, with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. And if you want a historical enumeration then watch the Napoleon series with Christian Clavier, Isabella Rossalini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu.This movie was made for Apple streaming. Then they made a butchered version for cinema to be able to compete for the Oscars. The original Apple streaming version will be at least 2 hours longer. This cut version for cinema is somewhat rushed, disjointed and, as a result, confusing.We never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful and won the admiration of so many. Here it's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in reality, over here he's shown as a childish brute. The focus was more on set pieces and his relationship with Josephine.Joaquin Phoenix can play odd or troubled characters well. Here he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. He's too old for this role (Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined) and made the character seem bizarre than a charismatic leader. Vanessa Kirby as Josephine gets more traction.The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is of a very high order. The battle scenes are filmed well. Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes slick and impressive. But overall it's a below average movie. Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie."
"Napoleon","krzysiektom","26 November 2023",210,"What a disappointment. This film is BORING. A movie with a huge budget, good actors, about a person as fascinating and complex as Bonaparte, who participated in more than 60 battles and had drama, triumphs and failures that would be enough for a few lifetimes, is... BORING! Nothing is well explained, it's unclear who is who beside Napoleon and Josephine. Several unnecessary sex scenes between the two. What's even worse is that it's unclear why the French nation would follow and worship this Napoleon as he's portrayed in this movie, because in this movie he seems a mediocre personality, without much charisma or extraordinary abilities. In addition, everything on the screen looks greyish blue, without vivid colors, and it is a bit depressing. I liked only two elements of this movie: musical score and costumes."
"Napoleon","levybob","2 December 2023",410,"I read the reviews of Ridley Scott's 'Napoleon' and knew it was not the great film everyone anticipated. Even so, I went. And what I discovered is that it's bad in the worst kind of way; It is dull. Lifeless. A flat un-involving story about characters who are in every way unlikable. Another reviewer wrote that he / she had trouble staying awake through its 2 hours 40 minutes run-time. When I read that I laughed. Now that I have seen the film, I am laughing no longer.Napoleon Bonaparte as Emperor of France did a lot of good things; much of the country's 'Civil Code' was instituted during his reign. But this film deals only with (a) Napoleon the warrior and (b) Napoleon the husband, and fails to deliver a well-rounded character in either sense. We know he loves France but aside from living there we don't know what drives his passion. His hatred for anything not France is clear, but the reasons for this hatred are never explained. There are battles a'plenty but the reason for them is elusive. Enemies become friends. Friends become enemies. We care about none of them. Thousands die. Somehow we care nothing about them either.There is, in Napoleon, no one to root for. Making matters worse there is an uneven performance by Joaquin Phoenix. His 'later' Napoleon becomes a different character than we'd seen earlier in the film. And no, I don't think it is attributed to Napoleon's rise in power. I think it's Phoenix; his acting, his portrayal. His Napoleon is far less quirky as the film progresses (as though the actor wants out of his role), and in this way, he is far less interesting.If there's anyone about whom we do care that character would be Josephine, Napoleon's wife and Empress of France. Vanessa Kirby is ravishing in the role. A rare beauty but one with a shadow-filled past as well as future. We can understand Napoleon's undying love her but the truth is, she's not the nicest girl on the block. There's little doubt that Mr. Bonaparte would never have 'won' her, were he not the country's future leader. So, again, no one to truly root for.Ah, yes. The battle scenes. They're fine (though it seems as though a battle fought at the base of Egypt's pyramids was cut out). But I think fewer battles and more unraveling of the reasons behind those battles between France, England, Russia, Austria, and other countries might make the remaining battles more meaningful.More involving.Which, as I said, this film is definitely not."
"Napoleon","Eleatic67","2 March 2024",610,"The success of any film depends mostly on the script. Why Scott would initiate such an expensive project without ensuring a refined and sophisticated script is a mystery. I'm not convinced there is a single interesting scene that provides insight into the characters or captures through language the prevailing political ideas. Scott's frequent missteps as a director reflect a greater interest in the cinematic rather than in the dramatic. However, this seems inevitable when your priority is delivering a blockbuster that will have broad appeal instead of digging deeper into culture, society, or history. A colossal waste of an extraordinary opportunity to create an important film about a fascinating historical figure."
"Napoleon","Vic_max","22 November 2023",610,"Many of Ridley Scott's movies are like visual masterpieces with epic storylines. I was sort of expecting something like Gladiator. Instead, it was just ""meh"" - I probably would have quit watching if it was on TV.Joaquin Phoenix has demonstrated that he can play odd or troubled characters well, but I don't think he was a good choice for Napoleon. He made the character seem more bizarre than charismatic or leader-like. I think the strongest and most interesting character was actually Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) ... who will probably get the most traction from the movie.The story itself wasn't that interesting because it wasn't explained that well. For example, his departure from Elba island seemed to randomly happen without much explanation. The elevation to a monarch-like role also happens without much explanation. It's like you're watching snippets of a bigger, more interesting story.I become so disconnected from the story that I almost fell asleep during some of the long battle sequences.The movie would probably have been better if it captured just one pivotal event or time period ... or better yet, if it had been a miniseries. While I will still look forward to any future movie from Scott, Napoleon deserved better."
"Napoleon","epicking","23 November 2023",310,"Im only focused on the historical aspect here ... and I only mentions a couple of out many hereIn the beginning, Napoleon abandons a battle at the Egyptian pyramids because Joséphine is unfaithful at home in Paris. It is pure fiction.Much later, when the two have divorced, he marches on Paris from his famous exile on the island of Elba, because he is jealous that the Russian Tsar Alexander is apparently taking a swing with Joséphine. From whom Napoleon, by the way, has long since divorced.It is a distortion of history of the worst kind. Joséphine dies of pneumonia in 1814. Napoleon first marches on Paris in 1815 to regain power, a wild story that could be a whole movie in itself.If you´re gonna make an expensive movie like this, get things right instead of just making romantic stuff up."
"Napoleon","LongTimeMovieLover","23 November 2023",410,"First, let me get this out of the way. If you want to watch a focused masterpiece, watch Waterloo with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. It could have only been better (for me) if Steiger had a French accent. Second, if you want to watch a general scoping history of Napoleon, consider the excellent and approachable Napoleon series with Christian Clavier (with a French accent), Isabella Rossallini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu. (Clavier is sometimes unfairly maligned when indeed he does a splendid job in my view.) There are other well-reputed less approachable versions, but these two are excellent.Now, as this work, let's start with Napoleon. A boyishly handsome, philosophically grounded (Napoleonic Code), egotistical, pugnacious genius, sometimes brooding sometimes loving, sometimes playing. That is, a strategically gifted, tactically trained, boyishly handsome, egotistical, passionate, lovable, fighting, moody, young genius.I am sorry, but this character requires someone like a young Brando or Pacino. Phoenix simply cannot, no-way, pull it off. Way wrong. Crazy wrong. He does not have the range. He is a great actor only in a particular type of role, a crouching villainous Caesar or a depressive Joker. A melancholic low-key whispering introverted Napoleon does not work, and some form of delusion by Scott allowed or put Phoenix into this role. I can easily get past failure of boyish good looks and the way wrong age (and Napoleon's young age is part of the story itself). But I cannot get past whispering tone and failure of charisma, passion and charm. Napoleon seduced a lot of people in a lot of ways.It's not Phoenix's fault he was miscast. Way miscast. Vanessa Kirby was fine and did her job. But, no one in this movie deserves any acting nominations. Take one common scene, being the ""Will you shoot your emperor?"" following Napoleon's escape from Elba and return to France, the other referenced Napoleons had timing, tension, and drama, here blah, nothing. Nothing! It's just bad. Really bad.Nothing in this movie taught me anything, made me think, made me feel, or moved me in any way. Terribly unengaging. Even the couple attempts at comic relief (if there would have been any tension, which was devoid) it was misplaced and failed miserably.Now, let's talk about the versions. This is the 2.5H version and there is another 4H version to be released by Apple+. Everything is a gimmick these days. Every streaming channel has one gem, but I'll suggest this work is inherently flawed by miscast Phoenix and more time to blend the scenes won't do it. In this 2.5H version, it's like a bunch of scenes without any context. We go from the French Revolution through the Reign of Terror through Napoleon's coup through Austerlitz through first defeat through Elba through return to France through Waterloo, through St. Helena. In 2.5H, even with the right actor who has engaging charisma and charm, it's too much ground. No character development whatsoever. None. Even in 4H it's like getting two bad suits for the price of one. It's just more of what's bad, which is miscast Phoenix in the titular role. I only understood the movie because I love and know the history. My wife and 86 year old father could not follow it, and my 19 year old daughter (somewhat tired from returning from college) dozed off a couple of times. No one liked the movie. And we even went out of our way to the IMAX because, well, it was Napoleon.I almost forgot to mention the emasculation of Napoleon by Josephine, the jarring politically correct now-required social normalizing casting of extras, and the ending credits that count the dead but give no context for the concomitant social reforms.Braveheart was historically all wrong, but it was still a great story with a wonderful score. This Napoleon is a bad story, and, even if Napoleon was a fictional character it was still bad. It's both a bad reflection of a real man, a grossly incomplete historical depiction, and a bad story poorly told no matter what.Napoleon was loved, hated, admired and ridiculed, by many of the same people, at different times. He was, if nothing else, one of the greatest characters in the recorded history of mankind. To try to do it all fairly, with the wrong titular actor, is silly. Really silly. Delusively silly.Sir Ridley's movie The Last Duel failed for a similar reason, and then he blames the audience. It's not the production or even perhaps the precise movie direction that is going wrong, it's that the story itself is not well-told. Perhaps it's time for him to teach his tactical craft to a young person with the right vision for the story expression.I need to watch my Waterloo DVD again to get my head back to the right flavor of Napoleon the Great, not Napoleon the Whisperer.Nothing good, new or better. A waste of my time and money."
"Napoleon","heisenberg12","23 November 2023",510,"The title says it all. When anyone thinks about Napolean, they automatically think of the general, the egomaniacal conquerer, military genius who glorified and unified France after the French Revolution.So going into an ""epic"" 2 hour and 40 minute movie, you would safely assume we'd get a glimpse into that twisted, genius mind, especially from an actor like Phoenix, right?Wrong. Instead we get practically a two hour, unoriginal portrait of his banal relationship with Josephine; yes, the rest of the 45 minutes are indeed battles that were good, not great. The lopsided focus on Josephine is unwarranted and unjustified, merely because we didn't learn anything new that we couldn't already assume if it only featured a half hour with their relationship on screen. Honestly, I still cannot fathom any point in that narrative decision after enduring it, as again, there were no twists or startling revelations; if the point was to just humanize Napoleon, we get it, he had a wife and dealt with her toxicity.The best part of the entire movie was the very end when the biographical title cards came up and revealed what a bloodlusting monster he really was, with the visceral explanation of the vast amount of lives he lost in his vain conquests. Back then, the world population was exponentially less than today. Three million in less than twenty years over 61 campaigns, with the Russian incursion costing three hundred plus thousand alone, seventy thousand at Waterloo. It's a shame that most of the tone of the movie not only was wasted on his love life, but moreso did not depict him as the maniacal sociopath he clearly was.On a side note, since we're delving into European French history and this piece failed to capture the period well enough, future filmmakers should hone in on the actual French Revolution. Tale of Two Cities, anyone? Nolan would crush it!4.5/10."
"Napoleon","malmevik77","25 November 2023",210,"NapoleonLet's start with the good things. The battle scenes are well shot, exciting, horrifying, the excellent work one can expect from a Ridley Scott movie.Josephine was fantastic. Her situation was clearly not ideal, and the actress portrayed her in such a way that I felt more for her than anyone else in the film.Now the bad things. All of it. This movie was not good at all. It was such a disappointment. This film had major problems with the flow of the story. It was extremely disjointed. I had no understanding of what was happening as it felt like someone took an outline and only filmed the bullet points, and not the detail beneath it. There is no transition from the coup in 1799 to the coronation in 1804. There is no explanation. There is no context as to how and why this was even acceptable.And don't get me started on historical inaccuracies. The very first scene shows Marie Antoinette getting beheaded in 1789 when that amazing invention called google can tell you otherwise.Maybe I'm being a bit harsh but I've studied English and French history quite extensively and it was cringe worthy to watch. Joaquin Phoenix was also very much miscast. I felt sorry for Vanessa Kirby as she was the highlight of the film. In all honesty, this film should have been called Josephine.I do not recommend watching this unless you're just there for the well shot battle scenes. The lake scene will give you chills. This film was a huge disappointment and I felt embarrassed for the filmmakers."
"Napoleon","itsahoverboard","23 November 2023",510,"Yes, that's a real quote from Joaquin Phoenix to Ridley Scott right before they started filming. I love Joaquin Phoenix, but you can really tell that he doesn't ""get"" the character of Napoleon that he's trying to play. I honestly don't know if Phoenix even has that kind of charisma and confidence within him, but then again I don't know anything about Napoleon either. But it was just uncomfortable watching him stumble his way through the movie, often just looking clueless.The other problem with the movie is it's just plain dull and uninteresting. It really does feel like a ""highlights"" movie. For an almost 3-hour film, it has surprisingly little dialogue. The dialogue that's there isn't' that illuminating or interesting. I normally like politics and romance (which is the bulk of this story), but I would have loved to see more military and war stuff in a movie like this. Isn't Napoleon supposed to be a brilliant war leader? There's like none of that here. Except ""oh we'll do a sneak attack in the night.""The cinematography was also really surprisingly dull. It looked super digital. The colors were so bland and washed out.Vanessa Kirby is really the best thing about the movie. And also the first battle taking over that fort, which was admittedly pretty epic. I have never seen such a thing happen to a horse in a movie, and it was wonderfully horrifying.I fully blame Ridley Scott for this dud. Hopefully Spielberg's Kubrick miniseries about Napoleon will be much better."
"Napoleon","zeki-4","22 November 2023",710,"Back in 2005 Ridley Scott's 144 minute version of 'Kingdom of Heaven' premiered in theatres to somewhat mixed reviews. A couple of years later the vastly superior 190 minute director's cut version finally arrived, with the general consensus that the final product was a masterclass in storytelling, directing, acting and cinematography. - without doubt the best motion picture ever made about the crusades.Almost 20 years later we are yet again treated with a compiled highlight reel of a Ridley Scott movie in the theatre, rather than a full-fledged historical epic, since it has already become official that 'Napoleon' will be released later on streaming with its entire runtime of almost four hours, which clearly is needed to flesh out many parts of the movie and fill in the emotional and historical blanks, because this - somewhat butchered cut - moves in a breakneck speed and feels too rushed.Whereas the underappreciated 1970 movie 'Waterloo' starring Rod Steiger as Napoleon Bonaparte, featuring thousands of extras, portrayed events only during the 100 days campaign in 1815, Scott's 'Napoleon' takes us through decades of various major events and battles beginning with the siege of Toulon in 1793. In this version we never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful. Why did he win the admiration of so many? It's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in real life, but here he is portrayed as a childish brute? It felt like the focus was more on setpieces and his troubled relationship with Josephine, than on him as a ruthless and cunning emperor, and in the theatre cut there really isn't a lot of places where Joaquin Phoenix truly shines as an Oscar contender. Maybe the director's cut will remedy that.In spite of its shortcomings (no pun intended) 'Napoleon' is still one of the best movies I have seen this year, but I am baffled. Because if people can sit through 3+ hour box office hits like 'Avengers Endgame', 'Avatar 2' and 'Oppenheimer' - why the need to release just a very extended trailer of 'Napoleon' in the theatre, especially when everyone know that they can just wait a couple of months for it to arrive on streaming in its entirety? An attempt by Apple at a cash grab? ""You need a subscription to our streaming service to watch the whole thing""?With that being said, I do predict some Oscar nominations here. Ridley Scott yet again proves why he is one of the best filmmakers out there. But a word of caution: If you only plan to see this once, you might consider waiting for the director's cut."
"Napoleon","gcarpiceci","22 November 2023",510,"History is an undesired guest taking the backseat in Mr Scott's sprawling epic on Napoleon's life.Mr Scott's craftsmanship is such that it's undoubtedly able to offer the viewer some unique experiences. But stunning battle visuals and great performances by the lead actors don't make up for gross historical approximation.I have no doubt whatsoever that Mr Scott knows his history and, if he didn't, he surely has a fat staff of assistants to tell it to him; so what he does here (as he did already in Gladiator) is a very deliberate and blatant choice to bend historical reality to the purposes of his own art, which looks like an act of unforgivable artistic hubris."
"Napoleon","richard-1787","27 November 2023",310,"This movie must have cost a fortune to make. (There is no budget listed yet here on IMDB.) You would think they could have spent a little of it on a good script. So many of the problems here stem from the bad script, which does not provide clues about what it going on.What we get is several large-scale but very unexciting battle scenes, where we watch the infantry march into suicidal battle, sometimes led by the cavalry, sometimes followed. In a movie about a fabled tactician, there is no discussion of what made him a success, what he did differently, etc.In between the battle episodes are some of the least romantic, un-erotic love scenes ever filmed. Phoenix and his leading lady have absolutely NO chemistry whatsoever. Half the time he is like a statue with her, the other half like an over-eager dog. We never get a hint of what he might see in her.I stayed through the whole 2.5 hours because I was with friends. Otherwise I would have left mid-way through, or fallen asleep - as Napoleon does several times himself during the battle scenes.I saw Oppenheimer, which is a full three hours long, three times last summer, and was riveted to it all three times. That movie was well directed. This movie didn't hold me at all, had no pacing, and was sometimes confusing even though I have studied that period of French history.Some will find fault with historical inaccuracies. There are evidently a fair number of them. But that doesn't bother me. What bothered me was that Scott and his crew never made this story come alive. Why spend all that money and all those resources on something that just is not interesting?"
"Napoleon","rachelnstephens","22 November 2023",410,"If I knew nothing of Napoleon, I'd be utterly confused about what was happening in this film. There is no hero's journey to follow and nobody to root for.Who is Napoleon? Why is he in France? How did he get to his position? The film begins with the death of Marie Antoinette and pretty much dives right into Napoleon being in charge somehow. Why Napoleon? No idea.Early on we meet Josephine's minor son who is never seen again on screen after a one-on-one meeting with Napoleon. Why does Napoleon meet with him? Why does he grant his request? Why is he interested in Josephine? No idea.The film feels as if you're a time traveller who is moving forward to different snapshots of Napoleon's life. There's little context or explanation. Lots of battle scenes, troop movement, flag signaling and even smelting to make munitions but not a lot of context. Why is Napoleon going here or there? No idea. What is his end goal? No idea. Why do Napoleon's men have an affinity for him? No idea.There are large spans of time between scenes so suddenly Josephine's daughter is a grown adult speaking with Napoleon. No clue who she was until Napoleon mentioned Josephine being her mother. Who are all of these people? No idea. How are they connected? No idea.The film is beautifully shot. The costuming is perfection. The set design is dreamy. Nobody can say that Ridley Scott doesn't know how to make a movie or that Joaquin Phoenix isn't a fantastic actor - it's simply a poor script."
"Napoleon","WadoodS","22 November 2023",510,"Making a movie on a charismatic person like Napoleon is a huge undertaking. It requires in-depth study of his life and then choosing specific events of his life to show and connecting them to perfection. The film maker is short in time therefore it is important for the movie to be precise, fluent and with a purpose. In this movie, the director, Ridley Scott, fails to determine which points of his life he wishes to portray and consequently it results in a piece-by-piece movie which lacks cinematic flow and confuses the audience.The movie disappoints in showing the battles, only briefly does it show the battles of Toulon and Austerlitz and then a bit longer Waterloo, of course concentrating more on Wellington's genius rather than Napoleon's side of things, where there is no mention of Marshal Grouchy's failed mission to block Blucher's army from joining the battle.As great an actor as Joaquin Phoenix is, he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. I felt like Napoleon was intentionally mimicked by the film maker to portray him as a socially awkward person who does not know his way around women, or even his soldiers who loved him so much. During the coup d'etat he is seen as a confused ""coward"" who escapes for his life and is only saved by the cleverness of his brother. But I have personally grown up around military personnel who are calm and composed in the face of adversity and prudently handle critical situations which makes it even more incredible that a military genius of Napoleon's stature would cower under pressure.Joaquin Phoenix's character lacks fundamental personal charisma which is so evident in leaders in general, and military leaders specifically. The movie fails to communicate why then the most civilized, liberal people on the planet earth during that time followed this uncharismatic, bland leader in 61 of his battles? French had already beheaded their king, and all French men were citizens with equal rights - at least only men. No other country in Europe has achieved this level of self-consciousness for human freedom at that time. There is also no mention of his civil, political, artistic achievements like the Code Napoleon or the great artists that flourished under him.Joaquin Phoenix is himself or rather he is still in his Joker character. Apparently, he didn't try enough to get into Napoleon's character. Look at Marlon Brando for example, who shines in his role as Napoleon. Joaquin is so one dimensional who seems to be asleep all the time and has no idea what he is doing while the real Napoleon was an energetic, charismatic, young, and quick individual.I tried to get over his age difference as he is too old to portray such a young person. Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined. He was 35 when he was crowned Emperor of the French. Joaquin Phoenix looks in his fifties in the whole movie. Vanessa Kirby's young age doesn't help much as Josephine was 6 years older. Vanessa Kirby plays brilliantly in her role and dominated every scene she was in as a cold, unfaithful, and then heart-broken queen.It was a brilliant opportunity wasted by the film makers. It could have been much better - as the brilliant life story is already there. The music could have been better. They should have used one of those music/sound directors Christopher Nolan uses in his movies. The cinematography was very good though. The battle scenes were filmed well. My friend pointed out that the cinematographer found his favorite angle on Vaness Kirby when they were in their private bedroom. I laughed more at this joke than at any ""funny"" moments in the movie. Overall, it is a below average movie. Don't go there with your hopes held high. I think Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie. Now I am not sure I will watch the director's cut. I am looking forward to a young, energetic director taking this enterprise and making a Braveheart-like movie."
"Napoleon","M_Exchange","22 November 2023",510,"As many of you know, Stanley Kubrick was obsessed with Napoleon, and he wanted to make his magnum opus about him near the end of his life. He never got around to it. I would have loved to have seen that film.This film is not a total disappointment, but it's far from great. I fell in love with its visuals, and I felt as if I was in the era of the 1790's/early 1800's. Its war scenes are good. Also, I appreciate that it does not hit the three hour mark, but it felt choppy and often incomplete. For instance, when Napoleon got punished a couple of times for his defeats one might think that he cut straight from a loss to a meeting with foreign dignitaries. In actuality, things were much messier in between.I never really felt a romantic spark between him and his first wife, and I never really felt much emotion ever throughout the entirety of the film. Even his death was rather anticlimactic and weak.I would recommend this film only to French people and history buffs."
"Napoleon","dorMancyx","22 November 2023",610,"I feel unsatisfied walking out of that theater after three hours of melancholy and confusion. I understand every single word and every single scene, but when they connect into a whole film I don't understand anything. To start off, the costume/production design, naturalistic sceneries, the two meticulously-depicted ancient warfares --- one amid the doleful squall of Austerlitz and another atop the dampened prairie of Waterloo --- and all other technical stuff are spotless. However, there's an anxiety-inducing problem with the narrative --- the movie has no focus. No climax, no resonating themes like Oppenheimer, just one plain, linear, chronological plot; and even that we get multiple baffling time jumps throughout. The plot is so simple that everything in the film was taught in my AP World History class last year in one day, except it nibbles on some superficial details. Highlighting the relationship between Napolean and Josephine is a unique take, and I do see efforts from the two esteemed performers to capture their mutual toxicity and intricacy, but this love story has barely anything to do with the movie's main arc, Napolean's personal rise and fall. Nothing! Two basically unrelated storylines unfolding in the most bland way possible. Also adding to this insipid mess is the score, which is composed primarily of classical or really old-sounding French folk --- what happened to Radiohead from the trailer? God Ridley I don't wanna say three hours of my life is wasted but it kinda is!I didn't think it was possible but, I think Oppenheimer's winning the Oscar."
"Napoleon","theRetiree","22 November 2023",410,"Just came from a full theater. At the end we got up and left in dead silence. No plot except broad strokes of history, little dialog, no passion, Phoenix seemed catatonic, and the movie was nothing more than set pieces posed to look like romantic paintings by Jacques-Louis David (who actually conveyed more emotion and spirit ). The early climax was Austerlitz, which Scott tried to stage as a replay of the destruction of the Teutonic Knights in Alexander.Nevsky. Wikipedia says maybe two of three soldiers (of thousands of casualties) died in the frozen ponds.Waterloo was equally lame, with French cavalry trying unsuccessfully to break the British Squares looking ridiculously like Plains Indians riding in circles attacking a wagon train. (Mel Brooks staged that better.) And Blucher's timely last minute arrival (which Wellington described as a ""near run thing"") had no tension and no suspense.Beautiful costumes and sets, a case of thousands, but unsatisfying either as historical spectacle or grand love affair, with Phoenix and the director both giving new meaning to the expression ""phoning it in."""
"Napoleon","jozenerd","26 November 2023",310,"During this movie, I just felt like watching a Monty Python's version of Napoleon or a BBC special based on a flyer they took on a train station about Napoleon's affairs and life troubles. Once again, Scott is making out his version of the history or the history that goes with his religion and political views. About Joaquin Phoenix's acting, it's sometimes laughable ala Eddie Redmayne on Jupiter Ascending, Halle Berry on Catwoman, or Marion Cotillard's death scene on Batman, that bad!!! Gosh, this movie is a reminder of past glories that are far gone and Mr. Scott is not deceiving me once again. He did it once with Covenant, guess who did it again? Not Britney!"
"Napoleon","nlcckc","23 November 2023",210,"So here is a film about one of the greatest warlords of history, and what do you suppose it emphasizes? If your guess is the yucky ""relationship"" he had with Josephine, you're not far from the truth.Here's what this movie contains:

"Napoleon","OwneyH","23 November 2023",110,"This was one of the worst big budget movies I have ever seen. I made it toward the later half of the movie and everyone had already walked out, I decided to also walk out. It was the first film I ever walked out on. Here is why:Napoleon opens with what is seemingly going to be a historical biography film adaptation of Napoleon's life, what you instead get is a poorly made, half attempt at a comedy. That's not an exaggeration, it really does play out like a half attempted comedy that's neither funny nor entertaining.It starts in the French Revolution, the first problems was Joaquin Phoenix. I never thought he was a bad actor, but he's bad in this movie. Not only is he a bad Napoleon, not only is he way older looking than actual Napoleon (who is supposed to be 24 at the start of the film), but it's like he didn't even wanna play the role. I don't know what he was going for here but what we got is a bumbling fool with no confidence in any regard, no sign of intelligence, no backstory, no character development, no knowledge of his life outside of his marriage, and above all no historical accuracy whatsoever.This isn't only Joaquin Phoenix's fault, it's Ridley Scott and writer David Scarpa too. Everyone failed this project.If what you were looking for is a film about the Napoleonic Wars, look elsewhere. There is almost no war in it, and what little war there was, is only little clips of warfare, and then straight back to Napoleon's marriage life. Even if you found the marriage stuff interesting about Napoleon, this still isn't the movie for you, because it's not accurate and the film makes it's point early on, but for some reason they keep going over the same ground already covered about Napoleon's love life. It get's very repetitive and quite frankly, boring.These clips of combat we get are completely disconnected from the story, it looks like it's randomly thrown in. They're also really short. If you remember, the trailer has combat in Egypt. You see all that combat in the trailer, that's it. There's no more of it. The trailer was better than the movie.As a history buff (especially history on the French Revolution/Napoleonic Wars) and a film buff, it comes off as offensive to the entire subject matter it's covering in history, offensive to the entire art form of filmmaking, and offensive to the intelligence of it's viewer.It takes nothing seriously, all these huge events regardless of your opinion is treated with disrespect.But most historical events are absent from this film. It focuses so heavily on this marriage story that you don't care about it because the film never tried to make you care, to the point where you feel shocked to see how much time has passed and how many events they skipped when you finally see a date pop up on the screen or an actual recognizable event.Or if you don't know Napoleonic history, you will be entirely lost as to what's happening because it explains nothing, it doesn't even mention why the Napoleonic Wars is happening at all. It doesn't even cover Napoleon growing as a general. Or even growing as a person. The look of Napoleon is even lazily done in this.This version of Napoleon is such a fool instead of a smart general, he makes Napoleon Dynamite look like a cool, collected, Chad.From a film making perspective, the movie is horribly made, generic to bad camera work, a bland soundtrack, HORRIBLE writing, a plot that goes nowhere.The only positives I can find is that some of the costume design is good, the sets are pretty well made, and the one scene in the trailer with the ice was cool. But I'd say watch the trailer again instead of the movie. But that's it. Those are the only good things.If you like Napoleon you won't like this, if you hate Napoleon you won't like this. If you like history you won't like this. If you don't care about history you won't like this. It's poorly made and boring for all. Find any other Napoleon focused movie and I'm sure it will be more entertaining.The trailer makes it seem like a different movie. I feel scammed, I feel lied to.A history film about the Napoleonic Wars with no history, no Napoleonic Wars, and an inaccurate Napoleon that's not fun to watch and at times straight up cringe to witness, makes this movie a solid 1. No entertainment value."
"Napoleon","gmznffvs","22 November 2023",310,"Napoleon is one of the greatest characters in history. He came out of the ashes of the French Revolution to not only lead the country but to inspire it. People were given new hope, aspirations and above all opportunities.Bonaparte created the first meritocracy in Europe. Ordinary people rose to positions of significance in the arts, sciences and all walks of life. In his army almost all the generals came from ordinary backgrounds, whereas pre the Revolution they were aristos.Not one person who doesn't know about Napoleon will know any of this when they come out of the movie.There is nothing to give an insight to his motivation Hint, it wasn't all for Josephine. There was no politics. None of the brilliant generals who fought with him get a look in. Bernadot was invited to be king of Sweden! Talleyrand was a self serving rat, but here is a nobody.Even the election of his brothers to the thrones of other European countries is not worth a mention.Napoleon enjoyed his power. Phoenix mopes about with his usual stone face making every day seem a chore.The only good part, worth the three stars is Waterloo, which is a good battle scene, if not by any means perfect, but watching the move from line to square was satisfying.Now people will think this morose dull man was Napoleon. How could he have been? Why would the French have loved him? Why would they welcome him back.What a disappointment."
"Napoleon","imseeg","23 November 2023",610,"A word of warning for those expecting another Gladiator or non stop action spectacle. It is not. Truly not...The bad: director Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes look slick and impressive (and he does an excellent job again), but he is also known for being quite average at making a drama. And this movie tries (and partly fails) to combine action and drama and somehow ends up being neither one. THAT is one of the reasons I'll only rate it with 6 stars.More bad: this story has a weak ""dramatic"" middle (love story) part, which is kinda tedious. And that brings me to a storyline complaint, namely that this story is all over the place. They cram SO much events and history and different characters from different time periods into this one movie that it kinda confused and numbed me down, instead of thrilling me, as an epic should do.This movie was made for Apple streaming (release date january 2024) in the first place, but they made a shorter (butchered) version for the cinemas in order to be able to compete for the Oscars, which demands that a movie must have run in the cinemas for a couple of weeks. No cinema version, no Oscars.The original Apple streaming version lasted some 2 hours longer. Nobody is gonna sit in the cinema for over 4 hours, hence they cut this movie up and now it feels somewhat rushed, confusing and disjointed at certain moments.Not any good then? Joaquin Phoenix is the one redeeming feature. He nails it.. He makes Napoleon look like a complete joke of a man and I love Joaquin Phoenix' performance, but that unfortunately didnt compensate for the other actors being just about average and with little actor's chemistry between them.I had been warned beforehand by friends that this wasnt the spectacle or epic drama they were hoping for and unfortunately they were right. Certainly not a terrible movie, but one that is just about average.Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb."
"Napoleon","petra_ste","3 December 2023",610,"Ridley Scott directed one of the best movies ever made set during the Napoleonic Wars: unfortunately, that movie is not Napoleon but his cinematic debut, The Duellists, forty years ago.Unsurprisingly, The Duellists had a strong source material (it was based on a novel by Joseph Conrad which it often followed almost verbatim), while Napoleon has an uneven screenplay by David Scarpa.Even past the age of eighty Sir Ridley can still shoot pretty and energetic pictures but his hits and misses depend on the scripts he picks, and he hasn't always shown the best discernment.The elephant in the room is the large amount of historical inaccuracies. Even as a history buff I can forgive many of those: cutting or simplifying events for the sake of narrative, or even some overdramatization like the meeting between Napoleon and Wellington (it never happened) or Napoleon being present at Marie Antoinette's execution (he wasn't); however, stuff like Napoleon charging with his troops at Waterloo is absolute cringe, a kid's (or a lout's) idea of history.Still, the big problems here are characterization and pacing.The movie is a demythologization (some would say emasculation) of Napoleon. If you want to take this route then fair enough, but the character here fails to be consistent. I can buy a Napoleon who is an egomaniac and an overrated tactician (like in Tolstoy's War and Peace). I do not buy one who is an anxious, insecure, uncharismatic cold fish but also a stern tactical genius and an effective leader of men, one who flees from Egypt because Josephine is unfaithful but is also an unflappable military mastermind.Phoenix is a great actor and does what he can but the two sides of the character just don't gel with each other. You can't have parodic moments like Napoleon rolling down the stairs during his coup against the Directory, despondently pouting as he waits for the rain to stop at Waterloo or awkwardly climbing on a box to stand face to face with a pharaoh's mummy (with his diminutive stature becoming a not-too-subtle metaphor of his overall mediocrity)... AND THEN have him magnetically charm the French soldiers into obedience after the Elba. This gawky Napoleon would have been shot to pieces there.The other problem is pacing. A single movie about the whole life of Napoleon is in itself absurd, like making ""a movie about World War 2"". There is material in Napoleon's life for a VERY dense miniseries (which Steven Spielberg is reportedly planning).Napoleon's first wife Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) plays a huge role here but I would argue the movie has either too little or way too much of her. This needed to be either focused mostly on Napoleon's personal life or to drastically reduce the (fairly repetitive after a while) moments where Napoleon is obsessed with his wife.As it is now, it tries to tell - but rushes through - twenty very eventful years of European history and yet devotes more time to Napoleon visiting Josephine after their divorce than to his Russian campaign.It's like making a D-Day movie which keeps cutting back and forth from the Normandy landings to Hitler spending time with Eva Braun. You can have either The Longest Day or Der Untergang, not both.Still, it's not worthless. There are some interesting moments and set-pieces and, while Phoenix is saddled with a contradictory character, Kirby at least is excellent.6/10."
"Napoleon","MissSimonetta","25 November 2023",210,"Ridley Scott's NAPOLEON feels like the highlight reel of a lengthy miniseries. Considering there's a 4-hour cut of this film, that explains it all.NAPOLEON is certainly good spectacle. The battle scenes are breathtaking. Unfortunately, it's also shallow. I know Scott has sneered at viewers criticizing the historical inaccuracies in the film, but I'm more bothered by a total lack of interesting character psychology or even coherent storytelling. Characters pop in and out, leaving little impression in their brief scenes. Relationships between characters are barely fleshed out, including that of Napoleon and Josephine, which dominates the running time. Also, potentially unpopular opinion, I thought Joaquin Phoenix's performance was a one-note bore.Perhaps the 4-hour version is a richer piece of work. As is, NAPOLEON is a let down, especially after Scott's brilliant 2021 period piece THE LAST DUEL, which had all the drama and psychological depth this movie lacked."
"Napoleon","dhunjiwadia","26 November 2023",510,"Ridley Scott's Napoleon is more hysterical than historical. History is like an uninvited guest in this movie. Stunning battle visuals don't make up for gross historical approximations.If you want to watch a masterpiece then see Waterloo, with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. And if you want a historical enumeration then watch the Napoleon series with Christian Clavier, Isabella Rossalini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu.This movie was made for Apple streaming. Then they made a butchered version for cinema to be able to compete for the Oscars. The original Apple streaming version will be at least 2 hours longer. This cut version for cinema is somewhat rushed, disjointed and, as a result, confusing.We never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful and won the admiration of so many. Here it's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in reality, over here he's shown as a childish brute. The focus was more on set pieces and his relationship with Josephine.Joaquin Phoenix can play odd or troubled characters well. Here he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. He's too old for this role (Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined) and made the character seem bizarre than a charismatic leader. Vanessa Kirby as Josephine gets more traction.The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is of a very high order. The battle scenes are filmed well. Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes slick and impressive. But overall it's a below average movie. Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie."
"Napoleon","krzysiektom","26 November 2023",210,"What a disappointment. This film is BORING. A movie with a huge budget, good actors, about a person as fascinating and complex as Bonaparte, who participated in more than 60 battles and had drama, triumphs and failures that would be enough for a few lifetimes, is... BORING! Nothing is well explained, it's unclear who is who beside Napoleon and Josephine. Several unnecessary sex scenes between the two. What's even worse is that it's unclear why the French nation would follow and worship this Napoleon as he's portrayed in this movie, because in this movie he seems a mediocre personality, without much charisma or extraordinary abilities. In addition, everything on the screen looks greyish blue, without vivid colors, and it is a bit depressing. I liked only two elements of this movie: musical score and costumes."
"Napoleon","levybob","2 December 2023",410,"I read the reviews of Ridley Scott's 'Napoleon' and knew it was not the great film everyone anticipated. Even so, I went. And what I discovered is that it's bad in the worst kind of way; It is dull. Lifeless. A flat un-involving story about characters who are in every way unlikable. Another reviewer wrote that he / she had trouble staying awake through its 2 hours 40 minutes run-time. When I read that I laughed. Now that I have seen the film, I am laughing no longer.Napoleon Bonaparte as Emperor of France did a lot of good things; much of the country's 'Civil Code' was instituted during his reign. But this film deals only with (a) Napoleon the warrior and (b) Napoleon the husband, and fails to deliver a well-rounded character in either sense. We know he loves France but aside from living there we don't know what drives his passion. His hatred for anything not France is clear, but the reasons for this hatred are never explained. There are battles a'plenty but the reason for them is elusive. Enemies become friends. Friends become enemies. We care about none of them. Thousands die. Somehow we care nothing about them either.There is, in Napoleon, no one to root for. Making matters worse there is an uneven performance by Joaquin Phoenix. His 'later' Napoleon becomes a different character than we'd seen earlier in the film. And no, I don't think it is attributed to Napoleon's rise in power. I think it's Phoenix; his acting, his portrayal. His Napoleon is far less quirky as the film progresses (as though the actor wants out of his role), and in this way, he is far less interesting.If there's anyone about whom we do care that character would be Josephine, Napoleon's wife and Empress of France. Vanessa Kirby is ravishing in the role. A rare beauty but one with a shadow-filled past as well as future. We can understand Napoleon's undying love her but the truth is, she's not the nicest girl on the block. There's little doubt that Mr. Bonaparte would never have 'won' her, were he not the country's future leader. So, again, no one to truly root for.Ah, yes. The battle scenes. They're fine (though it seems as though a battle fought at the base of Egypt's pyramids was cut out). But I think fewer battles and more unraveling of the reasons behind those battles between France, England, Russia, Austria, and other countries might make the remaining battles more meaningful.More involving.Which, as I said, this film is definitely not."
"Napoleon","Eleatic67","2 March 2024",610,"The success of any film depends mostly on the script. Why Scott would initiate such an expensive project without ensuring a refined and sophisticated script is a mystery. I'm not convinced there is a single interesting scene that provides insight into the characters or captures through language the prevailing political ideas. Scott's frequent missteps as a director reflect a greater interest in the cinematic rather than in the dramatic. However, this seems inevitable when your priority is delivering a blockbuster that will have broad appeal instead of digging deeper into culture, society, or history. A colossal waste of an extraordinary opportunity to create an important film about a fascinating historical figure."
"Napoleon","Vic_max","22 November 2023",610,"Many of Ridley Scott's movies are like visual masterpieces with epic storylines. I was sort of expecting something like Gladiator. Instead, it was just ""meh"" - I probably would have quit watching if it was on TV.Joaquin Phoenix has demonstrated that he can play odd or troubled characters well, but I don't think he was a good choice for Napoleon. He made the character seem more bizarre than charismatic or leader-like. I think the strongest and most interesting character was actually Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) ... who will probably get the most traction from the movie.The story itself wasn't that interesting because it wasn't explained that well. For example, his departure from Elba island seemed to randomly happen without much explanation. The elevation to a monarch-like role also happens without much explanation. It's like you're watching snippets of a bigger, more interesting story.I become so disconnected from the story that I almost fell asleep during some of the long battle sequences.The movie would probably have been better if it captured just one pivotal event or time period ... or better yet, if it had been a miniseries. While I will still look forward to any future movie from Scott, Napoleon deserved better."
"Napoleon","epicking","23 November 2023",310,"Im only focused on the historical aspect here ... and I only mentions a couple of out many hereIn the beginning, Napoleon abandons a battle at the Egyptian pyramids because Joséphine is unfaithful at home in Paris. It is pure fiction.Much later, when the two have divorced, he marches on Paris from his famous exile on the island of Elba, because he is jealous that the Russian Tsar Alexander is apparently taking a swing with Joséphine. From whom Napoleon, by the way, has long since divorced.It is a distortion of history of the worst kind. Joséphine dies of pneumonia in 1814. Napoleon first marches on Paris in 1815 to regain power, a wild story that could be a whole movie in itself.If you´re gonna make an expensive movie like this, get things right instead of just making romantic stuff up."
"Napoleon","LongTimeMovieLover","23 November 2023",410,"First, let me get this out of the way. If you want to watch a focused masterpiece, watch Waterloo with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. It could have only been better (for me) if Steiger had a French accent. Second, if you want to watch a general scoping history of Napoleon, consider the excellent and approachable Napoleon series with Christian Clavier (with a French accent), Isabella Rossallini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu. (Clavier is sometimes unfairly maligned when indeed he does a splendid job in my view.) There are other well-reputed less approachable versions, but these two are excellent.Now, as this work, let's start with Napoleon. A boyishly handsome, philosophically grounded (Napoleonic Code), egotistical, pugnacious genius, sometimes brooding sometimes loving, sometimes playing. That is, a strategically gifted, tactically trained, boyishly handsome, egotistical, passionate, lovable, fighting, moody, young genius.I am sorry, but this character requires someone like a young Brando or Pacino. Phoenix simply cannot, no-way, pull it off. Way wrong. Crazy wrong. He does not have the range. He is a great actor only in a particular type of role, a crouching villainous Caesar or a depressive Joker. A melancholic low-key whispering introverted Napoleon does not work, and some form of delusion by Scott allowed or put Phoenix into this role. I can easily get past failure of boyish good looks and the way wrong age (and Napoleon's young age is part of the story itself). But I cannot get past whispering tone and failure of charisma, passion and charm. Napoleon seduced a lot of people in a lot of ways.It's not Phoenix's fault he was miscast. Way miscast. Vanessa Kirby was fine and did her job. But, no one in this movie deserves any acting nominations. Take one common scene, being the ""Will you shoot your emperor?"" following Napoleon's escape from Elba and return to France, the other referenced Napoleons had timing, tension, and drama, here blah, nothing. Nothing! It's just bad. Really bad.Nothing in this movie taught me anything, made me think, made me feel, or moved me in any way. Terribly unengaging. Even the couple attempts at comic relief (if there would have been any tension, which was devoid) it was misplaced and failed miserably.Now, let's talk about the versions. This is the 2.5H version and there is another 4H version to be released by Apple+. Everything is a gimmick these days. Every streaming channel has one gem, but I'll suggest this work is inherently flawed by miscast Phoenix and more time to blend the scenes won't do it. In this 2.5H version, it's like a bunch of scenes without any context. We go from the French Revolution through the Reign of Terror through Napoleon's coup through Austerlitz through first defeat through Elba through return to France through Waterloo, through St. Helena. In 2.5H, even with the right actor who has engaging charisma and charm, it's too much ground. No character development whatsoever. None. Even in 4H it's like getting two bad suits for the price of one. It's just more of what's bad, which is miscast Phoenix in the titular role. I only understood the movie because I love and know the history. My wife and 86 year old father could not follow it, and my 19 year old daughter (somewhat tired from returning from college) dozed off a couple of times. No one liked the movie. And we even went out of our way to the IMAX because, well, it was Napoleon.I almost forgot to mention the emasculation of Napoleon by Josephine, the jarring politically correct now-required social normalizing casting of extras, and the ending credits that count the dead but give no context for the concomitant social reforms.Braveheart was historically all wrong, but it was still a great story with a wonderful score. This Napoleon is a bad story, and, even if Napoleon was a fictional character it was still bad. It's both a bad reflection of a real man, a grossly incomplete historical depiction, and a bad story poorly told no matter what.Napoleon was loved, hated, admired and ridiculed, by many of the same people, at different times. He was, if nothing else, one of the greatest characters in the recorded history of mankind. To try to do it all fairly, with the wrong titular actor, is silly. Really silly. Delusively silly.Sir Ridley's movie The Last Duel failed for a similar reason, and then he blames the audience. It's not the production or even perhaps the precise movie direction that is going wrong, it's that the story itself is not well-told. Perhaps it's time for him to teach his tactical craft to a young person with the right vision for the story expression.I need to watch my Waterloo DVD again to get my head back to the right flavor of Napoleon the Great, not Napoleon the Whisperer.Nothing good, new or better. A waste of my time and money."
"Napoleon","heisenberg12","23 November 2023",510,"The title says it all. When anyone thinks about Napolean, they automatically think of the general, the egomaniacal conquerer, military genius who glorified and unified France after the French Revolution.So going into an ""epic"" 2 hour and 40 minute movie, you would safely assume we'd get a glimpse into that twisted, genius mind, especially from an actor like Phoenix, right?Wrong. Instead we get practically a two hour, unoriginal portrait of his banal relationship with Josephine; yes, the rest of the 45 minutes are indeed battles that were good, not great. The lopsided focus on Josephine is unwarranted and unjustified, merely because we didn't learn anything new that we couldn't already assume if it only featured a half hour with their relationship on screen. Honestly, I still cannot fathom any point in that narrative decision after enduring it, as again, there were no twists or startling revelations; if the point was to just humanize Napoleon, we get it, he had a wife and dealt with her toxicity.The best part of the entire movie was the very end when the biographical title cards came up and revealed what a bloodlusting monster he really was, with the visceral explanation of the vast amount of lives he lost in his vain conquests. Back then, the world population was exponentially less than today. Three million in less than twenty years over 61 campaigns, with the Russian incursion costing three hundred plus thousand alone, seventy thousand at Waterloo. It's a shame that most of the tone of the movie not only was wasted on his love life, but moreso did not depict him as the maniacal sociopath he clearly was.On a side note, since we're delving into European French history and this piece failed to capture the period well enough, future filmmakers should hone in on the actual French Revolution. Tale of Two Cities, anyone? Nolan would crush it!4.5/10."
"Napoleon","malmevik77","25 November 2023",210,"NapoleonLet's start with the good things. The battle scenes are well shot, exciting, horrifying, the excellent work one can expect from a Ridley Scott movie.Josephine was fantastic. Her situation was clearly not ideal, and the actress portrayed her in such a way that I felt more for her than anyone else in the film.Now the bad things. All of it. This movie was not good at all. It was such a disappointment. This film had major problems with the flow of the story. It was extremely disjointed. I had no understanding of what was happening as it felt like someone took an outline and only filmed the bullet points, and not the detail beneath it. There is no transition from the coup in 1799 to the coronation in 1804. There is no explanation. There is no context as to how and why this was even acceptable.And don't get me started on historical inaccuracies. The very first scene shows Marie Antoinette getting beheaded in 1789 when that amazing invention called google can tell you otherwise.Maybe I'm being a bit harsh but I've studied English and French history quite extensively and it was cringe worthy to watch. Joaquin Phoenix was also very much miscast. I felt sorry for Vanessa Kirby as she was the highlight of the film. In all honesty, this film should have been called Josephine.I do not recommend watching this unless you're just there for the well shot battle scenes. The lake scene will give you chills. This film was a huge disappointment and I felt embarrassed for the filmmakers."
"Napoleon","itsahoverboard","23 November 2023",510,"Yes, that's a real quote from Joaquin Phoenix to Ridley Scott right before they started filming. I love Joaquin Phoenix, but you can really tell that he doesn't ""get"" the character of Napoleon that he's trying to play. I honestly don't know if Phoenix even has that kind of charisma and confidence within him, but then again I don't know anything about Napoleon either. But it was just uncomfortable watching him stumble his way through the movie, often just looking clueless.The other problem with the movie is it's just plain dull and uninteresting. It really does feel like a ""highlights"" movie. For an almost 3-hour film, it has surprisingly little dialogue. The dialogue that's there isn't' that illuminating or interesting. I normally like politics and romance (which is the bulk of this story), but I would have loved to see more military and war stuff in a movie like this. Isn't Napoleon supposed to be a brilliant war leader? There's like none of that here. Except ""oh we'll do a sneak attack in the night.""The cinematography was also really surprisingly dull. It looked super digital. The colors were so bland and washed out.Vanessa Kirby is really the best thing about the movie. And also the first battle taking over that fort, which was admittedly pretty epic. I have never seen such a thing happen to a horse in a movie, and it was wonderfully horrifying.I fully blame Ridley Scott for this dud. Hopefully Spielberg's Kubrick miniseries about Napoleon will be much better."
"Napoleon","zeki-4","22 November 2023",710,"Back in 2005 Ridley Scott's 144 minute version of 'Kingdom of Heaven' premiered in theatres to somewhat mixed reviews. A couple of years later the vastly superior 190 minute director's cut version finally arrived, with the general consensus that the final product was a masterclass in storytelling, directing, acting and cinematography. - without doubt the best motion picture ever made about the crusades.Almost 20 years later we are yet again treated with a compiled highlight reel of a Ridley Scott movie in the theatre, rather than a full-fledged historical epic, since it has already become official that 'Napoleon' will be released later on streaming with its entire runtime of almost four hours, which clearly is needed to flesh out many parts of the movie and fill in the emotional and historical blanks, because this - somewhat butchered cut - moves in a breakneck speed and feels too rushed.Whereas the underappreciated 1970 movie 'Waterloo' starring Rod Steiger as Napoleon Bonaparte, featuring thousands of extras, portrayed events only during the 100 days campaign in 1815, Scott's 'Napoleon' takes us through decades of various major events and battles beginning with the siege of Toulon in 1793. In this version we never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful. Why did he win the admiration of so many? It's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in real life, but here he is portrayed as a childish brute? It felt like the focus was more on setpieces and his troubled relationship with Josephine, than on him as a ruthless and cunning emperor, and in the theatre cut there really isn't a lot of places where Joaquin Phoenix truly shines as an Oscar contender. Maybe the director's cut will remedy that.In spite of its shortcomings (no pun intended) 'Napoleon' is still one of the best movies I have seen this year, but I am baffled. Because if people can sit through 3+ hour box office hits like 'Avengers Endgame', 'Avatar 2' and 'Oppenheimer' - why the need to release just a very extended trailer of 'Napoleon' in the theatre, especially when everyone know that they can just wait a couple of months for it to arrive on streaming in its entirety? An attempt by Apple at a cash grab? ""You need a subscription to our streaming service to watch the whole thing""?With that being said, I do predict some Oscar nominations here. Ridley Scott yet again proves why he is one of the best filmmakers out there. But a word of caution: If you only plan to see this once, you might consider waiting for the director's cut."
"Napoleon","gcarpiceci","22 November 2023",510,"History is an undesired guest taking the backseat in Mr Scott's sprawling epic on Napoleon's life.Mr Scott's craftsmanship is such that it's undoubtedly able to offer the viewer some unique experiences. But stunning battle visuals and great performances by the lead actors don't make up for gross historical approximation.I have no doubt whatsoever that Mr Scott knows his history and, if he didn't, he surely has a fat staff of assistants to tell it to him; so what he does here (as he did already in Gladiator) is a very deliberate and blatant choice to bend historical reality to the purposes of his own art, which looks like an act of unforgivable artistic hubris."
"Napoleon","richard-1787","27 November 2023",310,"This movie must have cost a fortune to make. (There is no budget listed yet here on IMDB.) You would think they could have spent a little of it on a good script. So many of the problems here stem from the bad script, which does not provide clues about what it going on.What we get is several large-scale but very unexciting battle scenes, where we watch the infantry march into suicidal battle, sometimes led by the cavalry, sometimes followed. In a movie about a fabled tactician, there is no discussion of what made him a success, what he did differently, etc.In between the battle episodes are some of the least romantic, un-erotic love scenes ever filmed. Phoenix and his leading lady have absolutely NO chemistry whatsoever. Half the time he is like a statue with her, the other half like an over-eager dog. We never get a hint of what he might see in her.I stayed through the whole 2.5 hours because I was with friends. Otherwise I would have left mid-way through, or fallen asleep - as Napoleon does several times himself during the battle scenes.I saw Oppenheimer, which is a full three hours long, three times last summer, and was riveted to it all three times. That movie was well directed. This movie didn't hold me at all, had no pacing, and was sometimes confusing even though I have studied that period of French history.Some will find fault with historical inaccuracies. There are evidently a fair number of them. But that doesn't bother me. What bothered me was that Scott and his crew never made this story come alive. Why spend all that money and all those resources on something that just is not interesting?"
"Napoleon","rachelnstephens","22 November 2023",410,"If I knew nothing of Napoleon, I'd be utterly confused about what was happening in this film. There is no hero's journey to follow and nobody to root for.Who is Napoleon? Why is he in France? How did he get to his position? The film begins with the death of Marie Antoinette and pretty much dives right into Napoleon being in charge somehow. Why Napoleon? No idea.Early on we meet Josephine's minor son who is never seen again on screen after a one-on-one meeting with Napoleon. Why does Napoleon meet with him? Why does he grant his request? Why is he interested in Josephine? No idea.The film feels as if you're a time traveller who is moving forward to different snapshots of Napoleon's life. There's little context or explanation. Lots of battle scenes, troop movement, flag signaling and even smelting to make munitions but not a lot of context. Why is Napoleon going here or there? No idea. What is his end goal? No idea. Why do Napoleon's men have an affinity for him? No idea.There are large spans of time between scenes so suddenly Josephine's daughter is a grown adult speaking with Napoleon. No clue who she was until Napoleon mentioned Josephine being her mother. Who are all of these people? No idea. How are they connected? No idea.The film is beautifully shot. The costuming is perfection. The set design is dreamy. Nobody can say that Ridley Scott doesn't know how to make a movie or that Joaquin Phoenix isn't a fantastic actor - it's simply a poor script."
"Napoleon","WadoodS","22 November 2023",510,"Making a movie on a charismatic person like Napoleon is a huge undertaking. It requires in-depth study of his life and then choosing specific events of his life to show and connecting them to perfection. The film maker is short in time therefore it is important for the movie to be precise, fluent and with a purpose. In this movie, the director, Ridley Scott, fails to determine which points of his life he wishes to portray and consequently it results in a piece-by-piece movie which lacks cinematic flow and confuses the audience.The movie disappoints in showing the battles, only briefly does it show the battles of Toulon and Austerlitz and then a bit longer Waterloo, of course concentrating more on Wellington's genius rather than Napoleon's side of things, where there is no mention of Marshal Grouchy's failed mission to block Blucher's army from joining the battle.As great an actor as Joaquin Phoenix is, he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. I felt like Napoleon was intentionally mimicked by the film maker to portray him as a socially awkward person who does not know his way around women, or even his soldiers who loved him so much. During the coup d'etat he is seen as a confused ""coward"" who escapes for his life and is only saved by the cleverness of his brother. But I have personally grown up around military personnel who are calm and composed in the face of adversity and prudently handle critical situations which makes it even more incredible that a military genius of Napoleon's stature would cower under pressure.Joaquin Phoenix's character lacks fundamental personal charisma which is so evident in leaders in general, and military leaders specifically. The movie fails to communicate why then the most civilized, liberal people on the planet earth during that time followed this uncharismatic, bland leader in 61 of his battles? French had already beheaded their king, and all French men were citizens with equal rights - at least only men. No other country in Europe has achieved this level of self-consciousness for human freedom at that time. There is also no mention of his civil, political, artistic achievements like the Code Napoleon or the great artists that flourished under him.Joaquin Phoenix is himself or rather he is still in his Joker character. Apparently, he didn't try enough to get into Napoleon's character. Look at Marlon Brando for example, who shines in his role as Napoleon. Joaquin is so one dimensional who seems to be asleep all the time and has no idea what he is doing while the real Napoleon was an energetic, charismatic, young, and quick individual.I tried to get over his age difference as he is too old to portray such a young person. Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined. He was 35 when he was crowned Emperor of the French. Joaquin Phoenix looks in his fifties in the whole movie. Vanessa Kirby's young age doesn't help much as Josephine was 6 years older. Vanessa Kirby plays brilliantly in her role and dominated every scene she was in as a cold, unfaithful, and then heart-broken queen.It was a brilliant opportunity wasted by the film makers. It could have been much better - as the brilliant life story is already there. The music could have been better. They should have used one of those music/sound directors Christopher Nolan uses in his movies. The cinematography was very good though. The battle scenes were filmed well. My friend pointed out that the cinematographer found his favorite angle on Vaness Kirby when they were in their private bedroom. I laughed more at this joke than at any ""funny"" moments in the movie. Overall, it is a below average movie. Don't go there with your hopes held high. I think Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie. Now I am not sure I will watch the director's cut. I am looking forward to a young, energetic director taking this enterprise and making a Braveheart-like movie."
"Napoleon","M_Exchange","22 November 2023",510,"As many of you know, Stanley Kubrick was obsessed with Napoleon, and he wanted to make his magnum opus about him near the end of his life. He never got around to it. I would have loved to have seen that film.This film is not a total disappointment, but it's far from great. I fell in love with its visuals, and I felt as if I was in the era of the 1790's/early 1800's. Its war scenes are good. Also, I appreciate that it does not hit the three hour mark, but it felt choppy and often incomplete. For instance, when Napoleon got punished a couple of times for his defeats one might think that he cut straight from a loss to a meeting with foreign dignitaries. In actuality, things were much messier in between.I never really felt a romantic spark between him and his first wife, and I never really felt much emotion ever throughout the entirety of the film. Even his death was rather anticlimactic and weak.I would recommend this film only to French people and history buffs."
"Napoleon","dorMancyx","22 November 2023",610,"I feel unsatisfied walking out of that theater after three hours of melancholy and confusion. I understand every single word and every single scene, but when they connect into a whole film I don't understand anything. To start off, the costume/production design, naturalistic sceneries, the two meticulously-depicted ancient warfares --- one amid the doleful squall of Austerlitz and another atop the dampened prairie of Waterloo --- and all other technical stuff are spotless. However, there's an anxiety-inducing problem with the narrative --- the movie has no focus. No climax, no resonating themes like Oppenheimer, just one plain, linear, chronological plot; and even that we get multiple baffling time jumps throughout. The plot is so simple that everything in the film was taught in my AP World History class last year in one day, except it nibbles on some superficial details. Highlighting the relationship between Napolean and Josephine is a unique take, and I do see efforts from the two esteemed performers to capture their mutual toxicity and intricacy, but this love story has barely anything to do with the movie's main arc, Napolean's personal rise and fall. Nothing! Two basically unrelated storylines unfolding in the most bland way possible. Also adding to this insipid mess is the score, which is composed primarily of classical or really old-sounding French folk --- what happened to Radiohead from the trailer? God Ridley I don't wanna say three hours of my life is wasted but it kinda is!I didn't think it was possible but, I think Oppenheimer's winning the Oscar."
"Napoleon","theRetiree","22 November 2023",410,"Just came from a full theater. At the end we got up and left in dead silence. No plot except broad strokes of history, little dialog, no passion, Phoenix seemed catatonic, and the movie was nothing more than set pieces posed to look like romantic paintings by Jacques-Louis David (who actually conveyed more emotion and spirit ). The early climax was Austerlitz, which Scott tried to stage as a replay of the destruction of the Teutonic Knights in Alexander.Nevsky. Wikipedia says maybe two of three soldiers (of thousands of casualties) died in the frozen ponds.Waterloo was equally lame, with French cavalry trying unsuccessfully to break the British Squares looking ridiculously like Plains Indians riding in circles attacking a wagon train. (Mel Brooks staged that better.) And Blucher's timely last minute arrival (which Wellington described as a ""near run thing"") had no tension and no suspense.Beautiful costumes and sets, a case of thousands, but unsatisfying either as historical spectacle or grand love affair, with Phoenix and the director both giving new meaning to the expression ""phoning it in."""
"Napoleon","jozenerd","26 November 2023",310,"During this movie, I just felt like watching a Monty Python's version of Napoleon or a BBC special based on a flyer they took on a train station about Napoleon's affairs and life troubles. Once again, Scott is making out his version of the history or the history that goes with his religion and political views. About Joaquin Phoenix's acting, it's sometimes laughable ala Eddie Redmayne on Jupiter Ascending, Halle Berry on Catwoman, or Marion Cotillard's death scene on Batman, that bad!!! Gosh, this movie is a reminder of past glories that are far gone and Mr. Scott is not deceiving me once again. He did it once with Covenant, guess who did it again? Not Britney!"
"Napoleon","nlcckc","23 November 2023",210,"So here is a film about one of the greatest warlords of history, and what do you suppose it emphasizes? If your guess is the yucky ""relationship"" he had with Josephine, you're not far from the truth.Here's what this movie contains:

"Napoleon","OwneyH","23 November 2023",110,"This was one of the worst big budget movies I have ever seen. I made it toward the later half of the movie and everyone had already walked out, I decided to also walk out. It was the first film I ever walked out on. Here is why:Napoleon opens with what is seemingly going to be a historical biography film adaptation of Napoleon's life, what you instead get is a poorly made, half attempt at a comedy. That's not an exaggeration, it really does play out like a half attempted comedy that's neither funny nor entertaining.It starts in the French Revolution, the first problems was Joaquin Phoenix. I never thought he was a bad actor, but he's bad in this movie. Not only is he a bad Napoleon, not only is he way older looking than actual Napoleon (who is supposed to be 24 at the start of the film), but it's like he didn't even wanna play the role. I don't know what he was going for here but what we got is a bumbling fool with no confidence in any regard, no sign of intelligence, no backstory, no character development, no knowledge of his life outside of his marriage, and above all no historical accuracy whatsoever.This isn't only Joaquin Phoenix's fault, it's Ridley Scott and writer David Scarpa too. Everyone failed this project.If what you were looking for is a film about the Napoleonic Wars, look elsewhere. There is almost no war in it, and what little war there was, is only little clips of warfare, and then straight back to Napoleon's marriage life. Even if you found the marriage stuff interesting about Napoleon, this still isn't the movie for you, because it's not accurate and the film makes it's point early on, but for some reason they keep going over the same ground already covered about Napoleon's love life. It get's very repetitive and quite frankly, boring.These clips of combat we get are completely disconnected from the story, it looks like it's randomly thrown in. They're also really short. If you remember, the trailer has combat in Egypt. You see all that combat in the trailer, that's it. There's no more of it. The trailer was better than the movie.As a history buff (especially history on the French Revolution/Napoleonic Wars) and a film buff, it comes off as offensive to the entire subject matter it's covering in history, offensive to the entire art form of filmmaking, and offensive to the intelligence of it's viewer.It takes nothing seriously, all these huge events regardless of your opinion is treated with disrespect.But most historical events are absent from this film. It focuses so heavily on this marriage story that you don't care about it because the film never tried to make you care, to the point where you feel shocked to see how much time has passed and how many events they skipped when you finally see a date pop up on the screen or an actual recognizable event.Or if you don't know Napoleonic history, you will be entirely lost as to what's happening because it explains nothing, it doesn't even mention why the Napoleonic Wars is happening at all. It doesn't even cover Napoleon growing as a general. Or even growing as a person. The look of Napoleon is even lazily done in this.This version of Napoleon is such a fool instead of a smart general, he makes Napoleon Dynamite look like a cool, collected, Chad.From a film making perspective, the movie is horribly made, generic to bad camera work, a bland soundtrack, HORRIBLE writing, a plot that goes nowhere.The only positives I can find is that some of the costume design is good, the sets are pretty well made, and the one scene in the trailer with the ice was cool. But I'd say watch the trailer again instead of the movie. But that's it. Those are the only good things.If you like Napoleon you won't like this, if you hate Napoleon you won't like this. If you like history you won't like this. If you don't care about history you won't like this. It's poorly made and boring for all. Find any other Napoleon focused movie and I'm sure it will be more entertaining.The trailer makes it seem like a different movie. I feel scammed, I feel lied to.A history film about the Napoleonic Wars with no history, no Napoleonic Wars, and an inaccurate Napoleon that's not fun to watch and at times straight up cringe to witness, makes this movie a solid 1. No entertainment value."
"Napoleon","gmznffvs","22 November 2023",310,"Napoleon is one of the greatest characters in history. He came out of the ashes of the French Revolution to not only lead the country but to inspire it. People were given new hope, aspirations and above all opportunities.Bonaparte created the first meritocracy in Europe. Ordinary people rose to positions of significance in the arts, sciences and all walks of life. In his army almost all the generals came from ordinary backgrounds, whereas pre the Revolution they were aristos.Not one person who doesn't know about Napoleon will know any of this when they come out of the movie.There is nothing to give an insight to his motivation Hint, it wasn't all for Josephine. There was no politics. None of the brilliant generals who fought with him get a look in. Bernadot was invited to be king of Sweden! Talleyrand was a self serving rat, but here is a nobody.Even the election of his brothers to the thrones of other European countries is not worth a mention.Napoleon enjoyed his power. Phoenix mopes about with his usual stone face making every day seem a chore.The only good part, worth the three stars is Waterloo, which is a good battle scene, if not by any means perfect, but watching the move from line to square was satisfying.Now people will think this morose dull man was Napoleon. How could he have been? Why would the French have loved him? Why would they welcome him back.What a disappointment."
"Napoleon","imseeg","23 November 2023",610,"A word of warning for those expecting another Gladiator or non stop action spectacle. It is not. Truly not...The bad: director Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes look slick and impressive (and he does an excellent job again), but he is also known for being quite average at making a drama. And this movie tries (and partly fails) to combine action and drama and somehow ends up being neither one. THAT is one of the reasons I'll only rate it with 6 stars.More bad: this story has a weak ""dramatic"" middle (love story) part, which is kinda tedious. And that brings me to a storyline complaint, namely that this story is all over the place. They cram SO much events and history and different characters from different time periods into this one movie that it kinda confused and numbed me down, instead of thrilling me, as an epic should do.This movie was made for Apple streaming (release date january 2024) in the first place, but they made a shorter (butchered) version for the cinemas in order to be able to compete for the Oscars, which demands that a movie must have run in the cinemas for a couple of weeks. No cinema version, no Oscars.The original Apple streaming version lasted some 2 hours longer. Nobody is gonna sit in the cinema for over 4 hours, hence they cut this movie up and now it feels somewhat rushed, confusing and disjointed at certain moments.Not any good then? Joaquin Phoenix is the one redeeming feature. He nails it.. He makes Napoleon look like a complete joke of a man and I love Joaquin Phoenix' performance, but that unfortunately didnt compensate for the other actors being just about average and with little actor's chemistry between them.I had been warned beforehand by friends that this wasnt the spectacle or epic drama they were hoping for and unfortunately they were right. Certainly not a terrible movie, but one that is just about average.Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb."
"Napoleon","petra_ste","3 December 2023",610,"Ridley Scott directed one of the best movies ever made set during the Napoleonic Wars: unfortunately, that movie is not Napoleon but his cinematic debut, The Duellists, forty years ago.Unsurprisingly, The Duellists had a strong source material (it was based on a novel by Joseph Conrad which it often followed almost verbatim), while Napoleon has an uneven screenplay by David Scarpa.Even past the age of eighty Sir Ridley can still shoot pretty and energetic pictures but his hits and misses depend on the scripts he picks, and he hasn't always shown the best discernment.The elephant in the room is the large amount of historical inaccuracies. Even as a history buff I can forgive many of those: cutting or simplifying events for the sake of narrative, or even some overdramatization like the meeting between Napoleon and Wellington (it never happened) or Napoleon being present at Marie Antoinette's execution (he wasn't); however, stuff like Napoleon charging with his troops at Waterloo is absolute cringe, a kid's (or a lout's) idea of history.Still, the big problems here are characterization and pacing.The movie is a demythologization (some would say emasculation) of Napoleon. If you want to take this route then fair enough, but the character here fails to be consistent. I can buy a Napoleon who is an egomaniac and an overrated tactician (like in Tolstoy's War and Peace). I do not buy one who is an anxious, insecure, uncharismatic cold fish but also a stern tactical genius and an effective leader of men, one who flees from Egypt because Josephine is unfaithful but is also an unflappable military mastermind.Phoenix is a great actor and does what he can but the two sides of the character just don't gel with each other. You can't have parodic moments like Napoleon rolling down the stairs during his coup against the Directory, despondently pouting as he waits for the rain to stop at Waterloo or awkwardly climbing on a box to stand face to face with a pharaoh's mummy (with his diminutive stature becoming a not-too-subtle metaphor of his overall mediocrity)... AND THEN have him magnetically charm the French soldiers into obedience after the Elba. This gawky Napoleon would have been shot to pieces there.The other problem is pacing. A single movie about the whole life of Napoleon is in itself absurd, like making ""a movie about World War 2"". There is material in Napoleon's life for a VERY dense miniseries (which Steven Spielberg is reportedly planning).Napoleon's first wife Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) plays a huge role here but I would argue the movie has either too little or way too much of her. This needed to be either focused mostly on Napoleon's personal life or to drastically reduce the (fairly repetitive after a while) moments where Napoleon is obsessed with his wife.As it is now, it tries to tell - but rushes through - twenty very eventful years of European history and yet devotes more time to Napoleon visiting Josephine after their divorce than to his Russian campaign.It's like making a D-Day movie which keeps cutting back and forth from the Normandy landings to Hitler spending time with Eva Braun. You can have either The Longest Day or Der Untergang, not both.Still, it's not worthless. There are some interesting moments and set-pieces and, while Phoenix is saddled with a contradictory character, Kirby at least is excellent.6/10."
"Napoleon","MissSimonetta","25 November 2023",210,"Ridley Scott's NAPOLEON feels like the highlight reel of a lengthy miniseries. Considering there's a 4-hour cut of this film, that explains it all.NAPOLEON is certainly good spectacle. The battle scenes are breathtaking. Unfortunately, it's also shallow. I know Scott has sneered at viewers criticizing the historical inaccuracies in the film, but I'm more bothered by a total lack of interesting character psychology or even coherent storytelling. Characters pop in and out, leaving little impression in their brief scenes. Relationships between characters are barely fleshed out, including that of Napoleon and Josephine, which dominates the running time. Also, potentially unpopular opinion, I thought Joaquin Phoenix's performance was a one-note bore.Perhaps the 4-hour version is a richer piece of work. As is, NAPOLEON is a let down, especially after Scott's brilliant 2021 period piece THE LAST DUEL, which had all the drama and psychological depth this movie lacked."
"Napoleon","dhunjiwadia","26 November 2023",510,"Ridley Scott's Napoleon is more hysterical than historical. History is like an uninvited guest in this movie. Stunning battle visuals don't make up for gross historical approximations.If you want to watch a masterpiece then see Waterloo, with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. And if you want a historical enumeration then watch the Napoleon series with Christian Clavier, Isabella Rossalini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu.This movie was made for Apple streaming. Then they made a butchered version for cinema to be able to compete for the Oscars. The original Apple streaming version will be at least 2 hours longer. This cut version for cinema is somewhat rushed, disjointed and, as a result, confusing.We never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful and won the admiration of so many. Here it's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in reality, over here he's shown as a childish brute. The focus was more on set pieces and his relationship with Josephine.Joaquin Phoenix can play odd or troubled characters well. Here he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. He's too old for this role (Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined) and made the character seem bizarre than a charismatic leader. Vanessa Kirby as Josephine gets more traction.The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is of a very high order. The battle scenes are filmed well. Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes slick and impressive. But overall it's a below average movie. Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie."
"Napoleon","krzysiektom","26 November 2023",210,"What a disappointment. This film is BORING. A movie with a huge budget, good actors, about a person as fascinating and complex as Bonaparte, who participated in more than 60 battles and had drama, triumphs and failures that would be enough for a few lifetimes, is... BORING! Nothing is well explained, it's unclear who is who beside Napoleon and Josephine. Several unnecessary sex scenes between the two. What's even worse is that it's unclear why the French nation would follow and worship this Napoleon as he's portrayed in this movie, because in this movie he seems a mediocre personality, without much charisma or extraordinary abilities. In addition, everything on the screen looks greyish blue, without vivid colors, and it is a bit depressing. I liked only two elements of this movie: musical score and costumes."
"Napoleon","levybob","2 December 2023",410,"I read the reviews of Ridley Scott's 'Napoleon' and knew it was not the great film everyone anticipated. Even so, I went. And what I discovered is that it's bad in the worst kind of way; It is dull. Lifeless. A flat un-involving story about characters who are in every way unlikable. Another reviewer wrote that he / she had trouble staying awake through its 2 hours 40 minutes run-time. When I read that I laughed. Now that I have seen the film, I am laughing no longer.Napoleon Bonaparte as Emperor of France did a lot of good things; much of the country's 'Civil Code' was instituted during his reign. But this film deals only with (a) Napoleon the warrior and (b) Napoleon the husband, and fails to deliver a well-rounded character in either sense. We know he loves France but aside from living there we don't know what drives his passion. His hatred for anything not France is clear, but the reasons for this hatred are never explained. There are battles a'plenty but the reason for them is elusive. Enemies become friends. Friends become enemies. We care about none of them. Thousands die. Somehow we care nothing about them either.There is, in Napoleon, no one to root for. Making matters worse there is an uneven performance by Joaquin Phoenix. His 'later' Napoleon becomes a different character than we'd seen earlier in the film. And no, I don't think it is attributed to Napoleon's rise in power. I think it's Phoenix; his acting, his portrayal. His Napoleon is far less quirky as the film progresses (as though the actor wants out of his role), and in this way, he is far less interesting.If there's anyone about whom we do care that character would be Josephine, Napoleon's wife and Empress of France. Vanessa Kirby is ravishing in the role. A rare beauty but one with a shadow-filled past as well as future. We can understand Napoleon's undying love her but the truth is, she's not the nicest girl on the block. There's little doubt that Mr. Bonaparte would never have 'won' her, were he not the country's future leader. So, again, no one to truly root for.Ah, yes. The battle scenes. They're fine (though it seems as though a battle fought at the base of Egypt's pyramids was cut out). But I think fewer battles and more unraveling of the reasons behind those battles between France, England, Russia, Austria, and other countries might make the remaining battles more meaningful.More involving.Which, as I said, this film is definitely not."
"Napoleon","Eleatic67","2 March 2024",610,"The success of any film depends mostly on the script. Why Scott would initiate such an expensive project without ensuring a refined and sophisticated script is a mystery. I'm not convinced there is a single interesting scene that provides insight into the characters or captures through language the prevailing political ideas. Scott's frequent missteps as a director reflect a greater interest in the cinematic rather than in the dramatic. However, this seems inevitable when your priority is delivering a blockbuster that will have broad appeal instead of digging deeper into culture, society, or history. A colossal waste of an extraordinary opportunity to create an important film about a fascinating historical figure."
"Napoleon","Vic_max","22 November 2023",610,"Many of Ridley Scott's movies are like visual masterpieces with epic storylines. I was sort of expecting something like Gladiator. Instead, it was just ""meh"" - I probably would have quit watching if it was on TV.Joaquin Phoenix has demonstrated that he can play odd or troubled characters well, but I don't think he was a good choice for Napoleon. He made the character seem more bizarre than charismatic or leader-like. I think the strongest and most interesting character was actually Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) ... who will probably get the most traction from the movie.The story itself wasn't that interesting because it wasn't explained that well. For example, his departure from Elba island seemed to randomly happen without much explanation. The elevation to a monarch-like role also happens without much explanation. It's like you're watching snippets of a bigger, more interesting story.I become so disconnected from the story that I almost fell asleep during some of the long battle sequences.The movie would probably have been better if it captured just one pivotal event or time period ... or better yet, if it had been a miniseries. While I will still look forward to any future movie from Scott, Napoleon deserved better."
"Napoleon","epicking","23 November 2023",310,"Im only focused on the historical aspect here ... and I only mentions a couple of out many hereIn the beginning, Napoleon abandons a battle at the Egyptian pyramids because Joséphine is unfaithful at home in Paris. It is pure fiction.Much later, when the two have divorced, he marches on Paris from his famous exile on the island of Elba, because he is jealous that the Russian Tsar Alexander is apparently taking a swing with Joséphine. From whom Napoleon, by the way, has long since divorced.It is a distortion of history of the worst kind. Joséphine dies of pneumonia in 1814. Napoleon first marches on Paris in 1815 to regain power, a wild story that could be a whole movie in itself.If you´re gonna make an expensive movie like this, get things right instead of just making romantic stuff up."
"Napoleon","LongTimeMovieLover","23 November 2023",410,"First, let me get this out of the way. If you want to watch a focused masterpiece, watch Waterloo with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. It could have only been better (for me) if Steiger had a French accent. Second, if you want to watch a general scoping history of Napoleon, consider the excellent and approachable Napoleon series with Christian Clavier (with a French accent), Isabella Rossallini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu. (Clavier is sometimes unfairly maligned when indeed he does a splendid job in my view.) There are other well-reputed less approachable versions, but these two are excellent.Now, as this work, let's start with Napoleon. A boyishly handsome, philosophically grounded (Napoleonic Code), egotistical, pugnacious genius, sometimes brooding sometimes loving, sometimes playing. That is, a strategically gifted, tactically trained, boyishly handsome, egotistical, passionate, lovable, fighting, moody, young genius.I am sorry, but this character requires someone like a young Brando or Pacino. Phoenix simply cannot, no-way, pull it off. Way wrong. Crazy wrong. He does not have the range. He is a great actor only in a particular type of role, a crouching villainous Caesar or a depressive Joker. A melancholic low-key whispering introverted Napoleon does not work, and some form of delusion by Scott allowed or put Phoenix into this role. I can easily get past failure of boyish good looks and the way wrong age (and Napoleon's young age is part of the story itself). But I cannot get past whispering tone and failure of charisma, passion and charm. Napoleon seduced a lot of people in a lot of ways.It's not Phoenix's fault he was miscast. Way miscast. Vanessa Kirby was fine and did her job. But, no one in this movie deserves any acting nominations. Take one common scene, being the ""Will you shoot your emperor?"" following Napoleon's escape from Elba and return to France, the other referenced Napoleons had timing, tension, and drama, here blah, nothing. Nothing! It's just bad. Really bad.Nothing in this movie taught me anything, made me think, made me feel, or moved me in any way. Terribly unengaging. Even the couple attempts at comic relief (if there would have been any tension, which was devoid) it was misplaced and failed miserably.Now, let's talk about the versions. This is the 2.5H version and there is another 4H version to be released by Apple+. Everything is a gimmick these days. Every streaming channel has one gem, but I'll suggest this work is inherently flawed by miscast Phoenix and more time to blend the scenes won't do it. In this 2.5H version, it's like a bunch of scenes without any context. We go from the French Revolution through the Reign of Terror through Napoleon's coup through Austerlitz through first defeat through Elba through return to France through Waterloo, through St. Helena. In 2.5H, even with the right actor who has engaging charisma and charm, it's too much ground. No character development whatsoever. None. Even in 4H it's like getting two bad suits for the price of one. It's just more of what's bad, which is miscast Phoenix in the titular role. I only understood the movie because I love and know the history. My wife and 86 year old father could not follow it, and my 19 year old daughter (somewhat tired from returning from college) dozed off a couple of times. No one liked the movie. And we even went out of our way to the IMAX because, well, it was Napoleon.I almost forgot to mention the emasculation of Napoleon by Josephine, the jarring politically correct now-required social normalizing casting of extras, and the ending credits that count the dead but give no context for the concomitant social reforms.Braveheart was historically all wrong, but it was still a great story with a wonderful score. This Napoleon is a bad story, and, even if Napoleon was a fictional character it was still bad. It's both a bad reflection of a real man, a grossly incomplete historical depiction, and a bad story poorly told no matter what.Napoleon was loved, hated, admired and ridiculed, by many of the same people, at different times. He was, if nothing else, one of the greatest characters in the recorded history of mankind. To try to do it all fairly, with the wrong titular actor, is silly. Really silly. Delusively silly.Sir Ridley's movie The Last Duel failed for a similar reason, and then he blames the audience. It's not the production or even perhaps the precise movie direction that is going wrong, it's that the story itself is not well-told. Perhaps it's time for him to teach his tactical craft to a young person with the right vision for the story expression.I need to watch my Waterloo DVD again to get my head back to the right flavor of Napoleon the Great, not Napoleon the Whisperer.Nothing good, new or better. A waste of my time and money."
"Napoleon","heisenberg12","23 November 2023",510,"The title says it all. When anyone thinks about Napolean, they automatically think of the general, the egomaniacal conquerer, military genius who glorified and unified France after the French Revolution.So going into an ""epic"" 2 hour and 40 minute movie, you would safely assume we'd get a glimpse into that twisted, genius mind, especially from an actor like Phoenix, right?Wrong. Instead we get practically a two hour, unoriginal portrait of his banal relationship with Josephine; yes, the rest of the 45 minutes are indeed battles that were good, not great. The lopsided focus on Josephine is unwarranted and unjustified, merely because we didn't learn anything new that we couldn't already assume if it only featured a half hour with their relationship on screen. Honestly, I still cannot fathom any point in that narrative decision after enduring it, as again, there were no twists or startling revelations; if the point was to just humanize Napoleon, we get it, he had a wife and dealt with her toxicity.The best part of the entire movie was the very end when the biographical title cards came up and revealed what a bloodlusting monster he really was, with the visceral explanation of the vast amount of lives he lost in his vain conquests. Back then, the world population was exponentially less than today. Three million in less than twenty years over 61 campaigns, with the Russian incursion costing three hundred plus thousand alone, seventy thousand at Waterloo. It's a shame that most of the tone of the movie not only was wasted on his love life, but moreso did not depict him as the maniacal sociopath he clearly was.On a side note, since we're delving into European French history and this piece failed to capture the period well enough, future filmmakers should hone in on the actual French Revolution. Tale of Two Cities, anyone? Nolan would crush it!4.5/10."
"Napoleon","malmevik77","25 November 2023",210,"NapoleonLet's start with the good things. The battle scenes are well shot, exciting, horrifying, the excellent work one can expect from a Ridley Scott movie.Josephine was fantastic. Her situation was clearly not ideal, and the actress portrayed her in such a way that I felt more for her than anyone else in the film.Now the bad things. All of it. This movie was not good at all. It was such a disappointment. This film had major problems with the flow of the story. It was extremely disjointed. I had no understanding of what was happening as it felt like someone took an outline and only filmed the bullet points, and not the detail beneath it. There is no transition from the coup in 1799 to the coronation in 1804. There is no explanation. There is no context as to how and why this was even acceptable.And don't get me started on historical inaccuracies. The very first scene shows Marie Antoinette getting beheaded in 1789 when that amazing invention called google can tell you otherwise.Maybe I'm being a bit harsh but I've studied English and French history quite extensively and it was cringe worthy to watch. Joaquin Phoenix was also very much miscast. I felt sorry for Vanessa Kirby as she was the highlight of the film. In all honesty, this film should have been called Josephine.I do not recommend watching this unless you're just there for the well shot battle scenes. The lake scene will give you chills. This film was a huge disappointment and I felt embarrassed for the filmmakers."
"Napoleon","itsahoverboard","23 November 2023",510,"Yes, that's a real quote from Joaquin Phoenix to Ridley Scott right before they started filming. I love Joaquin Phoenix, but you can really tell that he doesn't ""get"" the character of Napoleon that he's trying to play. I honestly don't know if Phoenix even has that kind of charisma and confidence within him, but then again I don't know anything about Napoleon either. But it was just uncomfortable watching him stumble his way through the movie, often just looking clueless.The other problem with the movie is it's just plain dull and uninteresting. It really does feel like a ""highlights"" movie. For an almost 3-hour film, it has surprisingly little dialogue. The dialogue that's there isn't' that illuminating or interesting. I normally like politics and romance (which is the bulk of this story), but I would have loved to see more military and war stuff in a movie like this. Isn't Napoleon supposed to be a brilliant war leader? There's like none of that here. Except ""oh we'll do a sneak attack in the night.""The cinematography was also really surprisingly dull. It looked super digital. The colors were so bland and washed out.Vanessa Kirby is really the best thing about the movie. And also the first battle taking over that fort, which was admittedly pretty epic. I have never seen such a thing happen to a horse in a movie, and it was wonderfully horrifying.I fully blame Ridley Scott for this dud. Hopefully Spielberg's Kubrick miniseries about Napoleon will be much better."
"Napoleon","zeki-4","22 November 2023",710,"Back in 2005 Ridley Scott's 144 minute version of 'Kingdom of Heaven' premiered in theatres to somewhat mixed reviews. A couple of years later the vastly superior 190 minute director's cut version finally arrived, with the general consensus that the final product was a masterclass in storytelling, directing, acting and cinematography. - without doubt the best motion picture ever made about the crusades.Almost 20 years later we are yet again treated with a compiled highlight reel of a Ridley Scott movie in the theatre, rather than a full-fledged historical epic, since it has already become official that 'Napoleon' will be released later on streaming with its entire runtime of almost four hours, which clearly is needed to flesh out many parts of the movie and fill in the emotional and historical blanks, because this - somewhat butchered cut - moves in a breakneck speed and feels too rushed.Whereas the underappreciated 1970 movie 'Waterloo' starring Rod Steiger as Napoleon Bonaparte, featuring thousands of extras, portrayed events only during the 100 days campaign in 1815, Scott's 'Napoleon' takes us through decades of various major events and battles beginning with the siege of Toulon in 1793. In this version we never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful. Why did he win the admiration of so many? It's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in real life, but here he is portrayed as a childish brute? It felt like the focus was more on setpieces and his troubled relationship with Josephine, than on him as a ruthless and cunning emperor, and in the theatre cut there really isn't a lot of places where Joaquin Phoenix truly shines as an Oscar contender. Maybe the director's cut will remedy that.In spite of its shortcomings (no pun intended) 'Napoleon' is still one of the best movies I have seen this year, but I am baffled. Because if people can sit through 3+ hour box office hits like 'Avengers Endgame', 'Avatar 2' and 'Oppenheimer' - why the need to release just a very extended trailer of 'Napoleon' in the theatre, especially when everyone know that they can just wait a couple of months for it to arrive on streaming in its entirety? An attempt by Apple at a cash grab? ""You need a subscription to our streaming service to watch the whole thing""?With that being said, I do predict some Oscar nominations here. Ridley Scott yet again proves why he is one of the best filmmakers out there. But a word of caution: If you only plan to see this once, you might consider waiting for the director's cut."
"Napoleon","gcarpiceci","22 November 2023",510,"History is an undesired guest taking the backseat in Mr Scott's sprawling epic on Napoleon's life.Mr Scott's craftsmanship is such that it's undoubtedly able to offer the viewer some unique experiences. But stunning battle visuals and great performances by the lead actors don't make up for gross historical approximation.I have no doubt whatsoever that Mr Scott knows his history and, if he didn't, he surely has a fat staff of assistants to tell it to him; so what he does here (as he did already in Gladiator) is a very deliberate and blatant choice to bend historical reality to the purposes of his own art, which looks like an act of unforgivable artistic hubris."
"Napoleon","richard-1787","27 November 2023",310,"This movie must have cost a fortune to make. (There is no budget listed yet here on IMDB.) You would think they could have spent a little of it on a good script. So many of the problems here stem from the bad script, which does not provide clues about what it going on.What we get is several large-scale but very unexciting battle scenes, where we watch the infantry march into suicidal battle, sometimes led by the cavalry, sometimes followed. In a movie about a fabled tactician, there is no discussion of what made him a success, what he did differently, etc.In between the battle episodes are some of the least romantic, un-erotic love scenes ever filmed. Phoenix and his leading lady have absolutely NO chemistry whatsoever. Half the time he is like a statue with her, the other half like an over-eager dog. We never get a hint of what he might see in her.I stayed through the whole 2.5 hours because I was with friends. Otherwise I would have left mid-way through, or fallen asleep - as Napoleon does several times himself during the battle scenes.I saw Oppenheimer, which is a full three hours long, three times last summer, and was riveted to it all three times. That movie was well directed. This movie didn't hold me at all, had no pacing, and was sometimes confusing even though I have studied that period of French history.Some will find fault with historical inaccuracies. There are evidently a fair number of them. But that doesn't bother me. What bothered me was that Scott and his crew never made this story come alive. Why spend all that money and all those resources on something that just is not interesting?"
"Napoleon","rachelnstephens","22 November 2023",410,"If I knew nothing of Napoleon, I'd be utterly confused about what was happening in this film. There is no hero's journey to follow and nobody to root for.Who is Napoleon? Why is he in France? How did he get to his position? The film begins with the death of Marie Antoinette and pretty much dives right into Napoleon being in charge somehow. Why Napoleon? No idea.Early on we meet Josephine's minor son who is never seen again on screen after a one-on-one meeting with Napoleon. Why does Napoleon meet with him? Why does he grant his request? Why is he interested in Josephine? No idea.The film feels as if you're a time traveller who is moving forward to different snapshots of Napoleon's life. There's little context or explanation. Lots of battle scenes, troop movement, flag signaling and even smelting to make munitions but not a lot of context. Why is Napoleon going here or there? No idea. What is his end goal? No idea. Why do Napoleon's men have an affinity for him? No idea.There are large spans of time between scenes so suddenly Josephine's daughter is a grown adult speaking with Napoleon. No clue who she was until Napoleon mentioned Josephine being her mother. Who are all of these people? No idea. How are they connected? No idea.The film is beautifully shot. The costuming is perfection. The set design is dreamy. Nobody can say that Ridley Scott doesn't know how to make a movie or that Joaquin Phoenix isn't a fantastic actor - it's simply a poor script."
"Napoleon","WadoodS","22 November 2023",510,"Making a movie on a charismatic person like Napoleon is a huge undertaking. It requires in-depth study of his life and then choosing specific events of his life to show and connecting them to perfection. The film maker is short in time therefore it is important for the movie to be precise, fluent and with a purpose. In this movie, the director, Ridley Scott, fails to determine which points of his life he wishes to portray and consequently it results in a piece-by-piece movie which lacks cinematic flow and confuses the audience.The movie disappoints in showing the battles, only briefly does it show the battles of Toulon and Austerlitz and then a bit longer Waterloo, of course concentrating more on Wellington's genius rather than Napoleon's side of things, where there is no mention of Marshal Grouchy's failed mission to block Blucher's army from joining the battle.As great an actor as Joaquin Phoenix is, he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. I felt like Napoleon was intentionally mimicked by the film maker to portray him as a socially awkward person who does not know his way around women, or even his soldiers who loved him so much. During the coup d'etat he is seen as a confused ""coward"" who escapes for his life and is only saved by the cleverness of his brother. But I have personally grown up around military personnel who are calm and composed in the face of adversity and prudently handle critical situations which makes it even more incredible that a military genius of Napoleon's stature would cower under pressure.Joaquin Phoenix's character lacks fundamental personal charisma which is so evident in leaders in general, and military leaders specifically. The movie fails to communicate why then the most civilized, liberal people on the planet earth during that time followed this uncharismatic, bland leader in 61 of his battles? French had already beheaded their king, and all French men were citizens with equal rights - at least only men. No other country in Europe has achieved this level of self-consciousness for human freedom at that time. There is also no mention of his civil, political, artistic achievements like the Code Napoleon or the great artists that flourished under him.Joaquin Phoenix is himself or rather he is still in his Joker character. Apparently, he didn't try enough to get into Napoleon's character. Look at Marlon Brando for example, who shines in his role as Napoleon. Joaquin is so one dimensional who seems to be asleep all the time and has no idea what he is doing while the real Napoleon was an energetic, charismatic, young, and quick individual.I tried to get over his age difference as he is too old to portray such a young person. Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined. He was 35 when he was crowned Emperor of the French. Joaquin Phoenix looks in his fifties in the whole movie. Vanessa Kirby's young age doesn't help much as Josephine was 6 years older. Vanessa Kirby plays brilliantly in her role and dominated every scene she was in as a cold, unfaithful, and then heart-broken queen.It was a brilliant opportunity wasted by the film makers. It could have been much better - as the brilliant life story is already there. The music could have been better. They should have used one of those music/sound directors Christopher Nolan uses in his movies. The cinematography was very good though. The battle scenes were filmed well. My friend pointed out that the cinematographer found his favorite angle on Vaness Kirby when they were in their private bedroom. I laughed more at this joke than at any ""funny"" moments in the movie. Overall, it is a below average movie. Don't go there with your hopes held high. I think Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie. Now I am not sure I will watch the director's cut. I am looking forward to a young, energetic director taking this enterprise and making a Braveheart-like movie."
"Napoleon","M_Exchange","22 November 2023",510,"As many of you know, Stanley Kubrick was obsessed with Napoleon, and he wanted to make his magnum opus about him near the end of his life. He never got around to it. I would have loved to have seen that film.This film is not a total disappointment, but it's far from great. I fell in love with its visuals, and I felt as if I was in the era of the 1790's/early 1800's. Its war scenes are good. Also, I appreciate that it does not hit the three hour mark, but it felt choppy and often incomplete. For instance, when Napoleon got punished a couple of times for his defeats one might think that he cut straight from a loss to a meeting with foreign dignitaries. In actuality, things were much messier in between.I never really felt a romantic spark between him and his first wife, and I never really felt much emotion ever throughout the entirety of the film. Even his death was rather anticlimactic and weak.I would recommend this film only to French people and history buffs."
"Napoleon","dorMancyx","22 November 2023",610,"I feel unsatisfied walking out of that theater after three hours of melancholy and confusion. I understand every single word and every single scene, but when they connect into a whole film I don't understand anything. To start off, the costume/production design, naturalistic sceneries, the two meticulously-depicted ancient warfares --- one amid the doleful squall of Austerlitz and another atop the dampened prairie of Waterloo --- and all other technical stuff are spotless. However, there's an anxiety-inducing problem with the narrative --- the movie has no focus. No climax, no resonating themes like Oppenheimer, just one plain, linear, chronological plot; and even that we get multiple baffling time jumps throughout. The plot is so simple that everything in the film was taught in my AP World History class last year in one day, except it nibbles on some superficial details. Highlighting the relationship between Napolean and Josephine is a unique take, and I do see efforts from the two esteemed performers to capture their mutual toxicity and intricacy, but this love story has barely anything to do with the movie's main arc, Napolean's personal rise and fall. Nothing! Two basically unrelated storylines unfolding in the most bland way possible. Also adding to this insipid mess is the score, which is composed primarily of classical or really old-sounding French folk --- what happened to Radiohead from the trailer? God Ridley I don't wanna say three hours of my life is wasted but it kinda is!I didn't think it was possible but, I think Oppenheimer's winning the Oscar."
"Napoleon","theRetiree","22 November 2023",410,"Just came from a full theater. At the end we got up and left in dead silence. No plot except broad strokes of history, little dialog, no passion, Phoenix seemed catatonic, and the movie was nothing more than set pieces posed to look like romantic paintings by Jacques-Louis David (who actually conveyed more emotion and spirit ). The early climax was Austerlitz, which Scott tried to stage as a replay of the destruction of the Teutonic Knights in Alexander.Nevsky. Wikipedia says maybe two of three soldiers (of thousands of casualties) died in the frozen ponds.Waterloo was equally lame, with French cavalry trying unsuccessfully to break the British Squares looking ridiculously like Plains Indians riding in circles attacking a wagon train. (Mel Brooks staged that better.) And Blucher's timely last minute arrival (which Wellington described as a ""near run thing"") had no tension and no suspense.Beautiful costumes and sets, a case of thousands, but unsatisfying either as historical spectacle or grand love affair, with Phoenix and the director both giving new meaning to the expression ""phoning it in."""
"Napoleon","jozenerd","26 November 2023",310,"During this movie, I just felt like watching a Monty Python's version of Napoleon or a BBC special based on a flyer they took on a train station about Napoleon's affairs and life troubles. Once again, Scott is making out his version of the history or the history that goes with his religion and political views. About Joaquin Phoenix's acting, it's sometimes laughable ala Eddie Redmayne on Jupiter Ascending, Halle Berry on Catwoman, or Marion Cotillard's death scene on Batman, that bad!!! Gosh, this movie is a reminder of past glories that are far gone and Mr. Scott is not deceiving me once again. He did it once with Covenant, guess who did it again? Not Britney!"
"Napoleon","nlcckc","23 November 2023",210,"So here is a film about one of the greatest warlords of history, and what do you suppose it emphasizes? If your guess is the yucky ""relationship"" he had with Josephine, you're not far from the truth.Here's what this movie contains:

"Napoleon","OwneyH","23 November 2023",110,"This was one of the worst big budget movies I have ever seen. I made it toward the later half of the movie and everyone had already walked out, I decided to also walk out. It was the first film I ever walked out on. Here is why:Napoleon opens with what is seemingly going to be a historical biography film adaptation of Napoleon's life, what you instead get is a poorly made, half attempt at a comedy. That's not an exaggeration, it really does play out like a half attempted comedy that's neither funny nor entertaining.It starts in the French Revolution, the first problems was Joaquin Phoenix. I never thought he was a bad actor, but he's bad in this movie. Not only is he a bad Napoleon, not only is he way older looking than actual Napoleon (who is supposed to be 24 at the start of the film), but it's like he didn't even wanna play the role. I don't know what he was going for here but what we got is a bumbling fool with no confidence in any regard, no sign of intelligence, no backstory, no character development, no knowledge of his life outside of his marriage, and above all no historical accuracy whatsoever.This isn't only Joaquin Phoenix's fault, it's Ridley Scott and writer David Scarpa too. Everyone failed this project.If what you were looking for is a film about the Napoleonic Wars, look elsewhere. There is almost no war in it, and what little war there was, is only little clips of warfare, and then straight back to Napoleon's marriage life. Even if you found the marriage stuff interesting about Napoleon, this still isn't the movie for you, because it's not accurate and the film makes it's point early on, but for some reason they keep going over the same ground already covered about Napoleon's love life. It get's very repetitive and quite frankly, boring.These clips of combat we get are completely disconnected from the story, it looks like it's randomly thrown in. They're also really short. If you remember, the trailer has combat in Egypt. You see all that combat in the trailer, that's it. There's no more of it. The trailer was better than the movie.As a history buff (especially history on the French Revolution/Napoleonic Wars) and a film buff, it comes off as offensive to the entire subject matter it's covering in history, offensive to the entire art form of filmmaking, and offensive to the intelligence of it's viewer.It takes nothing seriously, all these huge events regardless of your opinion is treated with disrespect.But most historical events are absent from this film. It focuses so heavily on this marriage story that you don't care about it because the film never tried to make you care, to the point where you feel shocked to see how much time has passed and how many events they skipped when you finally see a date pop up on the screen or an actual recognizable event.Or if you don't know Napoleonic history, you will be entirely lost as to what's happening because it explains nothing, it doesn't even mention why the Napoleonic Wars is happening at all. It doesn't even cover Napoleon growing as a general. Or even growing as a person. The look of Napoleon is even lazily done in this.This version of Napoleon is such a fool instead of a smart general, he makes Napoleon Dynamite look like a cool, collected, Chad.From a film making perspective, the movie is horribly made, generic to bad camera work, a bland soundtrack, HORRIBLE writing, a plot that goes nowhere.The only positives I can find is that some of the costume design is good, the sets are pretty well made, and the one scene in the trailer with the ice was cool. But I'd say watch the trailer again instead of the movie. But that's it. Those are the only good things.If you like Napoleon you won't like this, if you hate Napoleon you won't like this. If you like history you won't like this. If you don't care about history you won't like this. It's poorly made and boring for all. Find any other Napoleon focused movie and I'm sure it will be more entertaining.The trailer makes it seem like a different movie. I feel scammed, I feel lied to.A history film about the Napoleonic Wars with no history, no Napoleonic Wars, and an inaccurate Napoleon that's not fun to watch and at times straight up cringe to witness, makes this movie a solid 1. No entertainment value."
"Napoleon","gmznffvs","22 November 2023",310,"Napoleon is one of the greatest characters in history. He came out of the ashes of the French Revolution to not only lead the country but to inspire it. People were given new hope, aspirations and above all opportunities.Bonaparte created the first meritocracy in Europe. Ordinary people rose to positions of significance in the arts, sciences and all walks of life. In his army almost all the generals came from ordinary backgrounds, whereas pre the Revolution they were aristos.Not one person who doesn't know about Napoleon will know any of this when they come out of the movie.There is nothing to give an insight to his motivation Hint, it wasn't all for Josephine. There was no politics. None of the brilliant generals who fought with him get a look in. Bernadot was invited to be king of Sweden! Talleyrand was a self serving rat, but here is a nobody.Even the election of his brothers to the thrones of other European countries is not worth a mention.Napoleon enjoyed his power. Phoenix mopes about with his usual stone face making every day seem a chore.The only good part, worth the three stars is Waterloo, which is a good battle scene, if not by any means perfect, but watching the move from line to square was satisfying.Now people will think this morose dull man was Napoleon. How could he have been? Why would the French have loved him? Why would they welcome him back.What a disappointment."
"Napoleon","imseeg","23 November 2023",610,"A word of warning for those expecting another Gladiator or non stop action spectacle. It is not. Truly not...The bad: director Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes look slick and impressive (and he does an excellent job again), but he is also known for being quite average at making a drama. And this movie tries (and partly fails) to combine action and drama and somehow ends up being neither one. THAT is one of the reasons I'll only rate it with 6 stars.More bad: this story has a weak ""dramatic"" middle (love story) part, which is kinda tedious. And that brings me to a storyline complaint, namely that this story is all over the place. They cram SO much events and history and different characters from different time periods into this one movie that it kinda confused and numbed me down, instead of thrilling me, as an epic should do.This movie was made for Apple streaming (release date january 2024) in the first place, but they made a shorter (butchered) version for the cinemas in order to be able to compete for the Oscars, which demands that a movie must have run in the cinemas for a couple of weeks. No cinema version, no Oscars.The original Apple streaming version lasted some 2 hours longer. Nobody is gonna sit in the cinema for over 4 hours, hence they cut this movie up and now it feels somewhat rushed, confusing and disjointed at certain moments.Not any good then? Joaquin Phoenix is the one redeeming feature. He nails it.. He makes Napoleon look like a complete joke of a man and I love Joaquin Phoenix' performance, but that unfortunately didnt compensate for the other actors being just about average and with little actor's chemistry between them.I had been warned beforehand by friends that this wasnt the spectacle or epic drama they were hoping for and unfortunately they were right. Certainly not a terrible movie, but one that is just about average.Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb."
"Napoleon","petra_ste","3 December 2023",610,"Ridley Scott directed one of the best movies ever made set during the Napoleonic Wars: unfortunately, that movie is not Napoleon but his cinematic debut, The Duellists, forty years ago.Unsurprisingly, The Duellists had a strong source material (it was based on a novel by Joseph Conrad which it often followed almost verbatim), while Napoleon has an uneven screenplay by David Scarpa.Even past the age of eighty Sir Ridley can still shoot pretty and energetic pictures but his hits and misses depend on the scripts he picks, and he hasn't always shown the best discernment.The elephant in the room is the large amount of historical inaccuracies. Even as a history buff I can forgive many of those: cutting or simplifying events for the sake of narrative, or even some overdramatization like the meeting between Napoleon and Wellington (it never happened) or Napoleon being present at Marie Antoinette's execution (he wasn't); however, stuff like Napoleon charging with his troops at Waterloo is absolute cringe, a kid's (or a lout's) idea of history.Still, the big problems here are characterization and pacing.The movie is a demythologization (some would say emasculation) of Napoleon. If you want to take this route then fair enough, but the character here fails to be consistent. I can buy a Napoleon who is an egomaniac and an overrated tactician (like in Tolstoy's War and Peace). I do not buy one who is an anxious, insecure, uncharismatic cold fish but also a stern tactical genius and an effective leader of men, one who flees from Egypt because Josephine is unfaithful but is also an unflappable military mastermind.Phoenix is a great actor and does what he can but the two sides of the character just don't gel with each other. You can't have parodic moments like Napoleon rolling down the stairs during his coup against the Directory, despondently pouting as he waits for the rain to stop at Waterloo or awkwardly climbing on a box to stand face to face with a pharaoh's mummy (with his diminutive stature becoming a not-too-subtle metaphor of his overall mediocrity)... AND THEN have him magnetically charm the French soldiers into obedience after the Elba. This gawky Napoleon would have been shot to pieces there.The other problem is pacing. A single movie about the whole life of Napoleon is in itself absurd, like making ""a movie about World War 2"". There is material in Napoleon's life for a VERY dense miniseries (which Steven Spielberg is reportedly planning).Napoleon's first wife Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) plays a huge role here but I would argue the movie has either too little or way too much of her. This needed to be either focused mostly on Napoleon's personal life or to drastically reduce the (fairly repetitive after a while) moments where Napoleon is obsessed with his wife.As it is now, it tries to tell - but rushes through - twenty very eventful years of European history and yet devotes more time to Napoleon visiting Josephine after their divorce than to his Russian campaign.It's like making a D-Day movie which keeps cutting back and forth from the Normandy landings to Hitler spending time with Eva Braun. You can have either The Longest Day or Der Untergang, not both.Still, it's not worthless. There are some interesting moments and set-pieces and, while Phoenix is saddled with a contradictory character, Kirby at least is excellent.6/10."
"Napoleon","MissSimonetta","25 November 2023",210,"Ridley Scott's NAPOLEON feels like the highlight reel of a lengthy miniseries. Considering there's a 4-hour cut of this film, that explains it all.NAPOLEON is certainly good spectacle. The battle scenes are breathtaking. Unfortunately, it's also shallow. I know Scott has sneered at viewers criticizing the historical inaccuracies in the film, but I'm more bothered by a total lack of interesting character psychology or even coherent storytelling. Characters pop in and out, leaving little impression in their brief scenes. Relationships between characters are barely fleshed out, including that of Napoleon and Josephine, which dominates the running time. Also, potentially unpopular opinion, I thought Joaquin Phoenix's performance was a one-note bore.Perhaps the 4-hour version is a richer piece of work. As is, NAPOLEON is a let down, especially after Scott's brilliant 2021 period piece THE LAST DUEL, which had all the drama and psychological depth this movie lacked."
"Napoleon","dhunjiwadia","26 November 2023",510,"Ridley Scott's Napoleon is more hysterical than historical. History is like an uninvited guest in this movie. Stunning battle visuals don't make up for gross historical approximations.If you want to watch a masterpiece then see Waterloo, with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. And if you want a historical enumeration then watch the Napoleon series with Christian Clavier, Isabella Rossalini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu.This movie was made for Apple streaming. Then they made a butchered version for cinema to be able to compete for the Oscars. The original Apple streaming version will be at least 2 hours longer. This cut version for cinema is somewhat rushed, disjointed and, as a result, confusing.We never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful and won the admiration of so many. Here it's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in reality, over here he's shown as a childish brute. The focus was more on set pieces and his relationship with Josephine.Joaquin Phoenix can play odd or troubled characters well. Here he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. He's too old for this role (Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined) and made the character seem bizarre than a charismatic leader. Vanessa Kirby as Josephine gets more traction.The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is of a very high order. The battle scenes are filmed well. Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes slick and impressive. But overall it's a below average movie. Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie."
"Napoleon","krzysiektom","26 November 2023",210,"What a disappointment. This film is BORING. A movie with a huge budget, good actors, about a person as fascinating and complex as Bonaparte, who participated in more than 60 battles and had drama, triumphs and failures that would be enough for a few lifetimes, is... BORING! Nothing is well explained, it's unclear who is who beside Napoleon and Josephine. Several unnecessary sex scenes between the two. What's even worse is that it's unclear why the French nation would follow and worship this Napoleon as he's portrayed in this movie, because in this movie he seems a mediocre personality, without much charisma or extraordinary abilities. In addition, everything on the screen looks greyish blue, without vivid colors, and it is a bit depressing. I liked only two elements of this movie: musical score and costumes."
"Napoleon","levybob","2 December 2023",410,"I read the reviews of Ridley Scott's 'Napoleon' and knew it was not the great film everyone anticipated. Even so, I went. And what I discovered is that it's bad in the worst kind of way; It is dull. Lifeless. A flat un-involving story about characters who are in every way unlikable. Another reviewer wrote that he / she had trouble staying awake through its 2 hours 40 minutes run-time. When I read that I laughed. Now that I have seen the film, I am laughing no longer.Napoleon Bonaparte as Emperor of France did a lot of good things; much of the country's 'Civil Code' was instituted during his reign. But this film deals only with (a) Napoleon the warrior and (b) Napoleon the husband, and fails to deliver a well-rounded character in either sense. We know he loves France but aside from living there we don't know what drives his passion. His hatred for anything not France is clear, but the reasons for this hatred are never explained. There are battles a'plenty but the reason for them is elusive. Enemies become friends. Friends become enemies. We care about none of them. Thousands die. Somehow we care nothing about them either.There is, in Napoleon, no one to root for. Making matters worse there is an uneven performance by Joaquin Phoenix. His 'later' Napoleon becomes a different character than we'd seen earlier in the film. And no, I don't think it is attributed to Napoleon's rise in power. I think it's Phoenix; his acting, his portrayal. His Napoleon is far less quirky as the film progresses (as though the actor wants out of his role), and in this way, he is far less interesting.If there's anyone about whom we do care that character would be Josephine, Napoleon's wife and Empress of France. Vanessa Kirby is ravishing in the role. A rare beauty but one with a shadow-filled past as well as future. We can understand Napoleon's undying love her but the truth is, she's not the nicest girl on the block. There's little doubt that Mr. Bonaparte would never have 'won' her, were he not the country's future leader. So, again, no one to truly root for.Ah, yes. The battle scenes. They're fine (though it seems as though a battle fought at the base of Egypt's pyramids was cut out). But I think fewer battles and more unraveling of the reasons behind those battles between France, England, Russia, Austria, and other countries might make the remaining battles more meaningful.More involving.Which, as I said, this film is definitely not."
"Napoleon","Eleatic67","2 March 2024",610,"The success of any film depends mostly on the script. Why Scott would initiate such an expensive project without ensuring a refined and sophisticated script is a mystery. I'm not convinced there is a single interesting scene that provides insight into the characters or captures through language the prevailing political ideas. Scott's frequent missteps as a director reflect a greater interest in the cinematic rather than in the dramatic. However, this seems inevitable when your priority is delivering a blockbuster that will have broad appeal instead of digging deeper into culture, society, or history. A colossal waste of an extraordinary opportunity to create an important film about a fascinating historical figure."
"Napoleon","Vic_max","22 November 2023",610,"Many of Ridley Scott's movies are like visual masterpieces with epic storylines. I was sort of expecting something like Gladiator. Instead, it was just ""meh"" - I probably would have quit watching if it was on TV.Joaquin Phoenix has demonstrated that he can play odd or troubled characters well, but I don't think he was a good choice for Napoleon. He made the character seem more bizarre than charismatic or leader-like. I think the strongest and most interesting character was actually Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) ... who will probably get the most traction from the movie.The story itself wasn't that interesting because it wasn't explained that well. For example, his departure from Elba island seemed to randomly happen without much explanation. The elevation to a monarch-like role also happens without much explanation. It's like you're watching snippets of a bigger, more interesting story.I become so disconnected from the story that I almost fell asleep during some of the long battle sequences.The movie would probably have been better if it captured just one pivotal event or time period ... or better yet, if it had been a miniseries. While I will still look forward to any future movie from Scott, Napoleon deserved better."
"Napoleon","epicking","23 November 2023",310,"Im only focused on the historical aspect here ... and I only mentions a couple of out many hereIn the beginning, Napoleon abandons a battle at the Egyptian pyramids because Joséphine is unfaithful at home in Paris. It is pure fiction.Much later, when the two have divorced, he marches on Paris from his famous exile on the island of Elba, because he is jealous that the Russian Tsar Alexander is apparently taking a swing with Joséphine. From whom Napoleon, by the way, has long since divorced.It is a distortion of history of the worst kind. Joséphine dies of pneumonia in 1814. Napoleon first marches on Paris in 1815 to regain power, a wild story that could be a whole movie in itself.If you´re gonna make an expensive movie like this, get things right instead of just making romantic stuff up."
"Napoleon","LongTimeMovieLover","23 November 2023",410,"First, let me get this out of the way. If you want to watch a focused masterpiece, watch Waterloo with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. It could have only been better (for me) if Steiger had a French accent. Second, if you want to watch a general scoping history of Napoleon, consider the excellent and approachable Napoleon series with Christian Clavier (with a French accent), Isabella Rossallini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu. (Clavier is sometimes unfairly maligned when indeed he does a splendid job in my view.) There are other well-reputed less approachable versions, but these two are excellent.Now, as this work, let's start with Napoleon. A boyishly handsome, philosophically grounded (Napoleonic Code), egotistical, pugnacious genius, sometimes brooding sometimes loving, sometimes playing. That is, a strategically gifted, tactically trained, boyishly handsome, egotistical, passionate, lovable, fighting, moody, young genius.I am sorry, but this character requires someone like a young Brando or Pacino. Phoenix simply cannot, no-way, pull it off. Way wrong. Crazy wrong. He does not have the range. He is a great actor only in a particular type of role, a crouching villainous Caesar or a depressive Joker. A melancholic low-key whispering introverted Napoleon does not work, and some form of delusion by Scott allowed or put Phoenix into this role. I can easily get past failure of boyish good looks and the way wrong age (and Napoleon's young age is part of the story itself). But I cannot get past whispering tone and failure of charisma, passion and charm. Napoleon seduced a lot of people in a lot of ways.It's not Phoenix's fault he was miscast. Way miscast. Vanessa Kirby was fine and did her job. But, no one in this movie deserves any acting nominations. Take one common scene, being the ""Will you shoot your emperor?"" following Napoleon's escape from Elba and return to France, the other referenced Napoleons had timing, tension, and drama, here blah, nothing. Nothing! It's just bad. Really bad.Nothing in this movie taught me anything, made me think, made me feel, or moved me in any way. Terribly unengaging. Even the couple attempts at comic relief (if there would have been any tension, which was devoid) it was misplaced and failed miserably.Now, let's talk about the versions. This is the 2.5H version and there is another 4H version to be released by Apple+. Everything is a gimmick these days. Every streaming channel has one gem, but I'll suggest this work is inherently flawed by miscast Phoenix and more time to blend the scenes won't do it. In this 2.5H version, it's like a bunch of scenes without any context. We go from the French Revolution through the Reign of Terror through Napoleon's coup through Austerlitz through first defeat through Elba through return to France through Waterloo, through St. Helena. In 2.5H, even with the right actor who has engaging charisma and charm, it's too much ground. No character development whatsoever. None. Even in 4H it's like getting two bad suits for the price of one. It's just more of what's bad, which is miscast Phoenix in the titular role. I only understood the movie because I love and know the history. My wife and 86 year old father could not follow it, and my 19 year old daughter (somewhat tired from returning from college) dozed off a couple of times. No one liked the movie. And we even went out of our way to the IMAX because, well, it was Napoleon.I almost forgot to mention the emasculation of Napoleon by Josephine, the jarring politically correct now-required social normalizing casting of extras, and the ending credits that count the dead but give no context for the concomitant social reforms.Braveheart was historically all wrong, but it was still a great story with a wonderful score. This Napoleon is a bad story, and, even if Napoleon was a fictional character it was still bad. It's both a bad reflection of a real man, a grossly incomplete historical depiction, and a bad story poorly told no matter what.Napoleon was loved, hated, admired and ridiculed, by many of the same people, at different times. He was, if nothing else, one of the greatest characters in the recorded history of mankind. To try to do it all fairly, with the wrong titular actor, is silly. Really silly. Delusively silly.Sir Ridley's movie The Last Duel failed for a similar reason, and then he blames the audience. It's not the production or even perhaps the precise movie direction that is going wrong, it's that the story itself is not well-told. Perhaps it's time for him to teach his tactical craft to a young person with the right vision for the story expression.I need to watch my Waterloo DVD again to get my head back to the right flavor of Napoleon the Great, not Napoleon the Whisperer.Nothing good, new or better. A waste of my time and money."
"Napoleon","heisenberg12","23 November 2023",510,"The title says it all. When anyone thinks about Napolean, they automatically think of the general, the egomaniacal conquerer, military genius who glorified and unified France after the French Revolution.So going into an ""epic"" 2 hour and 40 minute movie, you would safely assume we'd get a glimpse into that twisted, genius mind, especially from an actor like Phoenix, right?Wrong. Instead we get practically a two hour, unoriginal portrait of his banal relationship with Josephine; yes, the rest of the 45 minutes are indeed battles that were good, not great. The lopsided focus on Josephine is unwarranted and unjustified, merely because we didn't learn anything new that we couldn't already assume if it only featured a half hour with their relationship on screen. Honestly, I still cannot fathom any point in that narrative decision after enduring it, as again, there were no twists or startling revelations; if the point was to just humanize Napoleon, we get it, he had a wife and dealt with her toxicity.The best part of the entire movie was the very end when the biographical title cards came up and revealed what a bloodlusting monster he really was, with the visceral explanation of the vast amount of lives he lost in his vain conquests. Back then, the world population was exponentially less than today. Three million in less than twenty years over 61 campaigns, with the Russian incursion costing three hundred plus thousand alone, seventy thousand at Waterloo. It's a shame that most of the tone of the movie not only was wasted on his love life, but moreso did not depict him as the maniacal sociopath he clearly was.On a side note, since we're delving into European French history and this piece failed to capture the period well enough, future filmmakers should hone in on the actual French Revolution. Tale of Two Cities, anyone? Nolan would crush it!4.5/10."
"Napoleon","malmevik77","25 November 2023",210,"NapoleonLet's start with the good things. The battle scenes are well shot, exciting, horrifying, the excellent work one can expect from a Ridley Scott movie.Josephine was fantastic. Her situation was clearly not ideal, and the actress portrayed her in such a way that I felt more for her than anyone else in the film.Now the bad things. All of it. This movie was not good at all. It was such a disappointment. This film had major problems with the flow of the story. It was extremely disjointed. I had no understanding of what was happening as it felt like someone took an outline and only filmed the bullet points, and not the detail beneath it. There is no transition from the coup in 1799 to the coronation in 1804. There is no explanation. There is no context as to how and why this was even acceptable.And don't get me started on historical inaccuracies. The very first scene shows Marie Antoinette getting beheaded in 1789 when that amazing invention called google can tell you otherwise.Maybe I'm being a bit harsh but I've studied English and French history quite extensively and it was cringe worthy to watch. Joaquin Phoenix was also very much miscast. I felt sorry for Vanessa Kirby as she was the highlight of the film. In all honesty, this film should have been called Josephine.I do not recommend watching this unless you're just there for the well shot battle scenes. The lake scene will give you chills. This film was a huge disappointment and I felt embarrassed for the filmmakers."
"Napoleon","itsahoverboard","23 November 2023",510,"Yes, that's a real quote from Joaquin Phoenix to Ridley Scott right before they started filming. I love Joaquin Phoenix, but you can really tell that he doesn't ""get"" the character of Napoleon that he's trying to play. I honestly don't know if Phoenix even has that kind of charisma and confidence within him, but then again I don't know anything about Napoleon either. But it was just uncomfortable watching him stumble his way through the movie, often just looking clueless.The other problem with the movie is it's just plain dull and uninteresting. It really does feel like a ""highlights"" movie. For an almost 3-hour film, it has surprisingly little dialogue. The dialogue that's there isn't' that illuminating or interesting. I normally like politics and romance (which is the bulk of this story), but I would have loved to see more military and war stuff in a movie like this. Isn't Napoleon supposed to be a brilliant war leader? There's like none of that here. Except ""oh we'll do a sneak attack in the night.""The cinematography was also really surprisingly dull. It looked super digital. The colors were so bland and washed out.Vanessa Kirby is really the best thing about the movie. And also the first battle taking over that fort, which was admittedly pretty epic. I have never seen such a thing happen to a horse in a movie, and it was wonderfully horrifying.I fully blame Ridley Scott for this dud. Hopefully Spielberg's Kubrick miniseries about Napoleon will be much better."
"Napoleon","zeki-4","22 November 2023",710,"Back in 2005 Ridley Scott's 144 minute version of 'Kingdom of Heaven' premiered in theatres to somewhat mixed reviews. A couple of years later the vastly superior 190 minute director's cut version finally arrived, with the general consensus that the final product was a masterclass in storytelling, directing, acting and cinematography. - without doubt the best motion picture ever made about the crusades.Almost 20 years later we are yet again treated with a compiled highlight reel of a Ridley Scott movie in the theatre, rather than a full-fledged historical epic, since it has already become official that 'Napoleon' will be released later on streaming with its entire runtime of almost four hours, which clearly is needed to flesh out many parts of the movie and fill in the emotional and historical blanks, because this - somewhat butchered cut - moves in a breakneck speed and feels too rushed.Whereas the underappreciated 1970 movie 'Waterloo' starring Rod Steiger as Napoleon Bonaparte, featuring thousands of extras, portrayed events only during the 100 days campaign in 1815, Scott's 'Napoleon' takes us through decades of various major events and battles beginning with the siege of Toulon in 1793. In this version we never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful. Why did he win the admiration of so many? It's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in real life, but here he is portrayed as a childish brute? It felt like the focus was more on setpieces and his troubled relationship with Josephine, than on him as a ruthless and cunning emperor, and in the theatre cut there really isn't a lot of places where Joaquin Phoenix truly shines as an Oscar contender. Maybe the director's cut will remedy that.In spite of its shortcomings (no pun intended) 'Napoleon' is still one of the best movies I have seen this year, but I am baffled. Because if people can sit through 3+ hour box office hits like 'Avengers Endgame', 'Avatar 2' and 'Oppenheimer' - why the need to release just a very extended trailer of 'Napoleon' in the theatre, especially when everyone know that they can just wait a couple of months for it to arrive on streaming in its entirety? An attempt by Apple at a cash grab? ""You need a subscription to our streaming service to watch the whole thing""?With that being said, I do predict some Oscar nominations here. Ridley Scott yet again proves why he is one of the best filmmakers out there. But a word of caution: If you only plan to see this once, you might consider waiting for the director's cut."
"Napoleon","gcarpiceci","22 November 2023",510,"History is an undesired guest taking the backseat in Mr Scott's sprawling epic on Napoleon's life.Mr Scott's craftsmanship is such that it's undoubtedly able to offer the viewer some unique experiences. But stunning battle visuals and great performances by the lead actors don't make up for gross historical approximation.I have no doubt whatsoever that Mr Scott knows his history and, if he didn't, he surely has a fat staff of assistants to tell it to him; so what he does here (as he did already in Gladiator) is a very deliberate and blatant choice to bend historical reality to the purposes of his own art, which looks like an act of unforgivable artistic hubris."
"Napoleon","richard-1787","27 November 2023",310,"This movie must have cost a fortune to make. (There is no budget listed yet here on IMDB.) You would think they could have spent a little of it on a good script. So many of the problems here stem from the bad script, which does not provide clues about what it going on.What we get is several large-scale but very unexciting battle scenes, where we watch the infantry march into suicidal battle, sometimes led by the cavalry, sometimes followed. In a movie about a fabled tactician, there is no discussion of what made him a success, what he did differently, etc.In between the battle episodes are some of the least romantic, un-erotic love scenes ever filmed. Phoenix and his leading lady have absolutely NO chemistry whatsoever. Half the time he is like a statue with her, the other half like an over-eager dog. We never get a hint of what he might see in her.I stayed through the whole 2.5 hours because I was with friends. Otherwise I would have left mid-way through, or fallen asleep - as Napoleon does several times himself during the battle scenes.I saw Oppenheimer, which is a full three hours long, three times last summer, and was riveted to it all three times. That movie was well directed. This movie didn't hold me at all, had no pacing, and was sometimes confusing even though I have studied that period of French history.Some will find fault with historical inaccuracies. There are evidently a fair number of them. But that doesn't bother me. What bothered me was that Scott and his crew never made this story come alive. Why spend all that money and all those resources on something that just is not interesting?"
"Napoleon","rachelnstephens","22 November 2023",410,"If I knew nothing of Napoleon, I'd be utterly confused about what was happening in this film. There is no hero's journey to follow and nobody to root for.Who is Napoleon? Why is he in France? How did he get to his position? The film begins with the death of Marie Antoinette and pretty much dives right into Napoleon being in charge somehow. Why Napoleon? No idea.Early on we meet Josephine's minor son who is never seen again on screen after a one-on-one meeting with Napoleon. Why does Napoleon meet with him? Why does he grant his request? Why is he interested in Josephine? No idea.The film feels as if you're a time traveller who is moving forward to different snapshots of Napoleon's life. There's little context or explanation. Lots of battle scenes, troop movement, flag signaling and even smelting to make munitions but not a lot of context. Why is Napoleon going here or there? No idea. What is his end goal? No idea. Why do Napoleon's men have an affinity for him? No idea.There are large spans of time between scenes so suddenly Josephine's daughter is a grown adult speaking with Napoleon. No clue who she was until Napoleon mentioned Josephine being her mother. Who are all of these people? No idea. How are they connected? No idea.The film is beautifully shot. The costuming is perfection. The set design is dreamy. Nobody can say that Ridley Scott doesn't know how to make a movie or that Joaquin Phoenix isn't a fantastic actor - it's simply a poor script."
"Napoleon","WadoodS","22 November 2023",510,"Making a movie on a charismatic person like Napoleon is a huge undertaking. It requires in-depth study of his life and then choosing specific events of his life to show and connecting them to perfection. The film maker is short in time therefore it is important for the movie to be precise, fluent and with a purpose. In this movie, the director, Ridley Scott, fails to determine which points of his life he wishes to portray and consequently it results in a piece-by-piece movie which lacks cinematic flow and confuses the audience.The movie disappoints in showing the battles, only briefly does it show the battles of Toulon and Austerlitz and then a bit longer Waterloo, of course concentrating more on Wellington's genius rather than Napoleon's side of things, where there is no mention of Marshal Grouchy's failed mission to block Blucher's army from joining the battle.As great an actor as Joaquin Phoenix is, he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. I felt like Napoleon was intentionally mimicked by the film maker to portray him as a socially awkward person who does not know his way around women, or even his soldiers who loved him so much. During the coup d'etat he is seen as a confused ""coward"" who escapes for his life and is only saved by the cleverness of his brother. But I have personally grown up around military personnel who are calm and composed in the face of adversity and prudently handle critical situations which makes it even more incredible that a military genius of Napoleon's stature would cower under pressure.Joaquin Phoenix's character lacks fundamental personal charisma which is so evident in leaders in general, and military leaders specifically. The movie fails to communicate why then the most civilized, liberal people on the planet earth during that time followed this uncharismatic, bland leader in 61 of his battles? French had already beheaded their king, and all French men were citizens with equal rights - at least only men. No other country in Europe has achieved this level of self-consciousness for human freedom at that time. There is also no mention of his civil, political, artistic achievements like the Code Napoleon or the great artists that flourished under him.Joaquin Phoenix is himself or rather he is still in his Joker character. Apparently, he didn't try enough to get into Napoleon's character. Look at Marlon Brando for example, who shines in his role as Napoleon. Joaquin is so one dimensional who seems to be asleep all the time and has no idea what he is doing while the real Napoleon was an energetic, charismatic, young, and quick individual.I tried to get over his age difference as he is too old to portray such a young person. Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined. He was 35 when he was crowned Emperor of the French. Joaquin Phoenix looks in his fifties in the whole movie. Vanessa Kirby's young age doesn't help much as Josephine was 6 years older. Vanessa Kirby plays brilliantly in her role and dominated every scene she was in as a cold, unfaithful, and then heart-broken queen.It was a brilliant opportunity wasted by the film makers. It could have been much better - as the brilliant life story is already there. The music could have been better. They should have used one of those music/sound directors Christopher Nolan uses in his movies. The cinematography was very good though. The battle scenes were filmed well. My friend pointed out that the cinematographer found his favorite angle on Vaness Kirby when they were in their private bedroom. I laughed more at this joke than at any ""funny"" moments in the movie. Overall, it is a below average movie. Don't go there with your hopes held high. I think Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie. Now I am not sure I will watch the director's cut. I am looking forward to a young, energetic director taking this enterprise and making a Braveheart-like movie."
"Napoleon","M_Exchange","22 November 2023",510,"As many of you know, Stanley Kubrick was obsessed with Napoleon, and he wanted to make his magnum opus about him near the end of his life. He never got around to it. I would have loved to have seen that film.This film is not a total disappointment, but it's far from great. I fell in love with its visuals, and I felt as if I was in the era of the 1790's/early 1800's. Its war scenes are good. Also, I appreciate that it does not hit the three hour mark, but it felt choppy and often incomplete. For instance, when Napoleon got punished a couple of times for his defeats one might think that he cut straight from a loss to a meeting with foreign dignitaries. In actuality, things were much messier in between.I never really felt a romantic spark between him and his first wife, and I never really felt much emotion ever throughout the entirety of the film. Even his death was rather anticlimactic and weak.I would recommend this film only to French people and history buffs."
"Napoleon","dorMancyx","22 November 2023",610,"I feel unsatisfied walking out of that theater after three hours of melancholy and confusion. I understand every single word and every single scene, but when they connect into a whole film I don't understand anything. To start off, the costume/production design, naturalistic sceneries, the two meticulously-depicted ancient warfares --- one amid the doleful squall of Austerlitz and another atop the dampened prairie of Waterloo --- and all other technical stuff are spotless. However, there's an anxiety-inducing problem with the narrative --- the movie has no focus. No climax, no resonating themes like Oppenheimer, just one plain, linear, chronological plot; and even that we get multiple baffling time jumps throughout. The plot is so simple that everything in the film was taught in my AP World History class last year in one day, except it nibbles on some superficial details. Highlighting the relationship between Napolean and Josephine is a unique take, and I do see efforts from the two esteemed performers to capture their mutual toxicity and intricacy, but this love story has barely anything to do with the movie's main arc, Napolean's personal rise and fall. Nothing! Two basically unrelated storylines unfolding in the most bland way possible. Also adding to this insipid mess is the score, which is composed primarily of classical or really old-sounding French folk --- what happened to Radiohead from the trailer? God Ridley I don't wanna say three hours of my life is wasted but it kinda is!I didn't think it was possible but, I think Oppenheimer's winning the Oscar."
"Napoleon","theRetiree","22 November 2023",410,"Just came from a full theater. At the end we got up and left in dead silence. No plot except broad strokes of history, little dialog, no passion, Phoenix seemed catatonic, and the movie was nothing more than set pieces posed to look like romantic paintings by Jacques-Louis David (who actually conveyed more emotion and spirit ). The early climax was Austerlitz, which Scott tried to stage as a replay of the destruction of the Teutonic Knights in Alexander.Nevsky. Wikipedia says maybe two of three soldiers (of thousands of casualties) died in the frozen ponds.Waterloo was equally lame, with French cavalry trying unsuccessfully to break the British Squares looking ridiculously like Plains Indians riding in circles attacking a wagon train. (Mel Brooks staged that better.) And Blucher's timely last minute arrival (which Wellington described as a ""near run thing"") had no tension and no suspense.Beautiful costumes and sets, a case of thousands, but unsatisfying either as historical spectacle or grand love affair, with Phoenix and the director both giving new meaning to the expression ""phoning it in."""
"Napoleon","jozenerd","26 November 2023",310,"During this movie, I just felt like watching a Monty Python's version of Napoleon or a BBC special based on a flyer they took on a train station about Napoleon's affairs and life troubles. Once again, Scott is making out his version of the history or the history that goes with his religion and political views. About Joaquin Phoenix's acting, it's sometimes laughable ala Eddie Redmayne on Jupiter Ascending, Halle Berry on Catwoman, or Marion Cotillard's death scene on Batman, that bad!!! Gosh, this movie is a reminder of past glories that are far gone and Mr. Scott is not deceiving me once again. He did it once with Covenant, guess who did it again? Not Britney!"
"Napoleon","nlcckc","23 November 2023",210,"So here is a film about one of the greatest warlords of history, and what do you suppose it emphasizes? If your guess is the yucky ""relationship"" he had with Josephine, you're not far from the truth.Here's what this movie contains:

"Napoleon","OwneyH","23 November 2023",110,"This was one of the worst big budget movies I have ever seen. I made it toward the later half of the movie and everyone had already walked out, I decided to also walk out. It was the first film I ever walked out on. Here is why:Napoleon opens with what is seemingly going to be a historical biography film adaptation of Napoleon's life, what you instead get is a poorly made, half attempt at a comedy. That's not an exaggeration, it really does play out like a half attempted comedy that's neither funny nor entertaining.It starts in the French Revolution, the first problems was Joaquin Phoenix. I never thought he was a bad actor, but he's bad in this movie. Not only is he a bad Napoleon, not only is he way older looking than actual Napoleon (who is supposed to be 24 at the start of the film), but it's like he didn't even wanna play the role. I don't know what he was going for here but what we got is a bumbling fool with no confidence in any regard, no sign of intelligence, no backstory, no character development, no knowledge of his life outside of his marriage, and above all no historical accuracy whatsoever.This isn't only Joaquin Phoenix's fault, it's Ridley Scott and writer David Scarpa too. Everyone failed this project.If what you were looking for is a film about the Napoleonic Wars, look elsewhere. There is almost no war in it, and what little war there was, is only little clips of warfare, and then straight back to Napoleon's marriage life. Even if you found the marriage stuff interesting about Napoleon, this still isn't the movie for you, because it's not accurate and the film makes it's point early on, but for some reason they keep going over the same ground already covered about Napoleon's love life. It get's very repetitive and quite frankly, boring.These clips of combat we get are completely disconnected from the story, it looks like it's randomly thrown in. They're also really short. If you remember, the trailer has combat in Egypt. You see all that combat in the trailer, that's it. There's no more of it. The trailer was better than the movie.As a history buff (especially history on the French Revolution/Napoleonic Wars) and a film buff, it comes off as offensive to the entire subject matter it's covering in history, offensive to the entire art form of filmmaking, and offensive to the intelligence of it's viewer.It takes nothing seriously, all these huge events regardless of your opinion is treated with disrespect.But most historical events are absent from this film. It focuses so heavily on this marriage story that you don't care about it because the film never tried to make you care, to the point where you feel shocked to see how much time has passed and how many events they skipped when you finally see a date pop up on the screen or an actual recognizable event.Or if you don't know Napoleonic history, you will be entirely lost as to what's happening because it explains nothing, it doesn't even mention why the Napoleonic Wars is happening at all. It doesn't even cover Napoleon growing as a general. Or even growing as a person. The look of Napoleon is even lazily done in this.This version of Napoleon is such a fool instead of a smart general, he makes Napoleon Dynamite look like a cool, collected, Chad.From a film making perspective, the movie is horribly made, generic to bad camera work, a bland soundtrack, HORRIBLE writing, a plot that goes nowhere.The only positives I can find is that some of the costume design is good, the sets are pretty well made, and the one scene in the trailer with the ice was cool. But I'd say watch the trailer again instead of the movie. But that's it. Those are the only good things.If you like Napoleon you won't like this, if you hate Napoleon you won't like this. If you like history you won't like this. If you don't care about history you won't like this. It's poorly made and boring for all. Find any other Napoleon focused movie and I'm sure it will be more entertaining.The trailer makes it seem like a different movie. I feel scammed, I feel lied to.A history film about the Napoleonic Wars with no history, no Napoleonic Wars, and an inaccurate Napoleon that's not fun to watch and at times straight up cringe to witness, makes this movie a solid 1. No entertainment value."
"Napoleon","gmznffvs","22 November 2023",310,"Napoleon is one of the greatest characters in history. He came out of the ashes of the French Revolution to not only lead the country but to inspire it. People were given new hope, aspirations and above all opportunities.Bonaparte created the first meritocracy in Europe. Ordinary people rose to positions of significance in the arts, sciences and all walks of life. In his army almost all the generals came from ordinary backgrounds, whereas pre the Revolution they were aristos.Not one person who doesn't know about Napoleon will know any of this when they come out of the movie.There is nothing to give an insight to his motivation Hint, it wasn't all for Josephine. There was no politics. None of the brilliant generals who fought with him get a look in. Bernadot was invited to be king of Sweden! Talleyrand was a self serving rat, but here is a nobody.Even the election of his brothers to the thrones of other European countries is not worth a mention.Napoleon enjoyed his power. Phoenix mopes about with his usual stone face making every day seem a chore.The only good part, worth the three stars is Waterloo, which is a good battle scene, if not by any means perfect, but watching the move from line to square was satisfying.Now people will think this morose dull man was Napoleon. How could he have been? Why would the French have loved him? Why would they welcome him back.What a disappointment."
"Napoleon","imseeg","23 November 2023",610,"A word of warning for those expecting another Gladiator or non stop action spectacle. It is not. Truly not...The bad: director Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes look slick and impressive (and he does an excellent job again), but he is also known for being quite average at making a drama. And this movie tries (and partly fails) to combine action and drama and somehow ends up being neither one. THAT is one of the reasons I'll only rate it with 6 stars.More bad: this story has a weak ""dramatic"" middle (love story) part, which is kinda tedious. And that brings me to a storyline complaint, namely that this story is all over the place. They cram SO much events and history and different characters from different time periods into this one movie that it kinda confused and numbed me down, instead of thrilling me, as an epic should do.This movie was made for Apple streaming (release date january 2024) in the first place, but they made a shorter (butchered) version for the cinemas in order to be able to compete for the Oscars, which demands that a movie must have run in the cinemas for a couple of weeks. No cinema version, no Oscars.The original Apple streaming version lasted some 2 hours longer. Nobody is gonna sit in the cinema for over 4 hours, hence they cut this movie up and now it feels somewhat rushed, confusing and disjointed at certain moments.Not any good then? Joaquin Phoenix is the one redeeming feature. He nails it.. He makes Napoleon look like a complete joke of a man and I love Joaquin Phoenix' performance, but that unfortunately didnt compensate for the other actors being just about average and with little actor's chemistry between them.I had been warned beforehand by friends that this wasnt the spectacle or epic drama they were hoping for and unfortunately they were right. Certainly not a terrible movie, but one that is just about average.Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb."
"Napoleon","petra_ste","3 December 2023",610,"Ridley Scott directed one of the best movies ever made set during the Napoleonic Wars: unfortunately, that movie is not Napoleon but his cinematic debut, The Duellists, forty years ago.Unsurprisingly, The Duellists had a strong source material (it was based on a novel by Joseph Conrad which it often followed almost verbatim), while Napoleon has an uneven screenplay by David Scarpa.Even past the age of eighty Sir Ridley can still shoot pretty and energetic pictures but his hits and misses depend on the scripts he picks, and he hasn't always shown the best discernment.The elephant in the room is the large amount of historical inaccuracies. Even as a history buff I can forgive many of those: cutting or simplifying events for the sake of narrative, or even some overdramatization like the meeting between Napoleon and Wellington (it never happened) or Napoleon being present at Marie Antoinette's execution (he wasn't); however, stuff like Napoleon charging with his troops at Waterloo is absolute cringe, a kid's (or a lout's) idea of history.Still, the big problems here are characterization and pacing.The movie is a demythologization (some would say emasculation) of Napoleon. If you want to take this route then fair enough, but the character here fails to be consistent. I can buy a Napoleon who is an egomaniac and an overrated tactician (like in Tolstoy's War and Peace). I do not buy one who is an anxious, insecure, uncharismatic cold fish but also a stern tactical genius and an effective leader of men, one who flees from Egypt because Josephine is unfaithful but is also an unflappable military mastermind.Phoenix is a great actor and does what he can but the two sides of the character just don't gel with each other. You can't have parodic moments like Napoleon rolling down the stairs during his coup against the Directory, despondently pouting as he waits for the rain to stop at Waterloo or awkwardly climbing on a box to stand face to face with a pharaoh's mummy (with his diminutive stature becoming a not-too-subtle metaphor of his overall mediocrity)... AND THEN have him magnetically charm the French soldiers into obedience after the Elba. This gawky Napoleon would have been shot to pieces there.The other problem is pacing. A single movie about the whole life of Napoleon is in itself absurd, like making ""a movie about World War 2"". There is material in Napoleon's life for a VERY dense miniseries (which Steven Spielberg is reportedly planning).Napoleon's first wife Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) plays a huge role here but I would argue the movie has either too little or way too much of her. This needed to be either focused mostly on Napoleon's personal life or to drastically reduce the (fairly repetitive after a while) moments where Napoleon is obsessed with his wife.As it is now, it tries to tell - but rushes through - twenty very eventful years of European history and yet devotes more time to Napoleon visiting Josephine after their divorce than to his Russian campaign.It's like making a D-Day movie which keeps cutting back and forth from the Normandy landings to Hitler spending time with Eva Braun. You can have either The Longest Day or Der Untergang, not both.Still, it's not worthless. There are some interesting moments and set-pieces and, while Phoenix is saddled with a contradictory character, Kirby at least is excellent.6/10."
"Napoleon","MissSimonetta","25 November 2023",210,"Ridley Scott's NAPOLEON feels like the highlight reel of a lengthy miniseries. Considering there's a 4-hour cut of this film, that explains it all.NAPOLEON is certainly good spectacle. The battle scenes are breathtaking. Unfortunately, it's also shallow. I know Scott has sneered at viewers criticizing the historical inaccuracies in the film, but I'm more bothered by a total lack of interesting character psychology or even coherent storytelling. Characters pop in and out, leaving little impression in their brief scenes. Relationships between characters are barely fleshed out, including that of Napoleon and Josephine, which dominates the running time. Also, potentially unpopular opinion, I thought Joaquin Phoenix's performance was a one-note bore.Perhaps the 4-hour version is a richer piece of work. As is, NAPOLEON is a let down, especially after Scott's brilliant 2021 period piece THE LAST DUEL, which had all the drama and psychological depth this movie lacked."
"Napoleon","dhunjiwadia","26 November 2023",510,"Ridley Scott's Napoleon is more hysterical than historical. History is like an uninvited guest in this movie. Stunning battle visuals don't make up for gross historical approximations.If you want to watch a masterpiece then see Waterloo, with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. And if you want a historical enumeration then watch the Napoleon series with Christian Clavier, Isabella Rossalini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu.This movie was made for Apple streaming. Then they made a butchered version for cinema to be able to compete for the Oscars. The original Apple streaming version will be at least 2 hours longer. This cut version for cinema is somewhat rushed, disjointed and, as a result, confusing.We never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful and won the admiration of so many. Here it's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in reality, over here he's shown as a childish brute. The focus was more on set pieces and his relationship with Josephine.Joaquin Phoenix can play odd or troubled characters well. Here he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. He's too old for this role (Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined) and made the character seem bizarre than a charismatic leader. Vanessa Kirby as Josephine gets more traction.The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is of a very high order. The battle scenes are filmed well. Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes slick and impressive. But overall it's a below average movie. Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie."
"Napoleon","krzysiektom","26 November 2023",210,"What a disappointment. This film is BORING. A movie with a huge budget, good actors, about a person as fascinating and complex as Bonaparte, who participated in more than 60 battles and had drama, triumphs and failures that would be enough for a few lifetimes, is... BORING! Nothing is well explained, it's unclear who is who beside Napoleon and Josephine. Several unnecessary sex scenes between the two. What's even worse is that it's unclear why the French nation would follow and worship this Napoleon as he's portrayed in this movie, because in this movie he seems a mediocre personality, without much charisma or extraordinary abilities. In addition, everything on the screen looks greyish blue, without vivid colors, and it is a bit depressing. I liked only two elements of this movie: musical score and costumes."
"Napoleon","levybob","2 December 2023",410,"I read the reviews of Ridley Scott's 'Napoleon' and knew it was not the great film everyone anticipated. Even so, I went. And what I discovered is that it's bad in the worst kind of way; It is dull. Lifeless. A flat un-involving story about characters who are in every way unlikable. Another reviewer wrote that he / she had trouble staying awake through its 2 hours 40 minutes run-time. When I read that I laughed. Now that I have seen the film, I am laughing no longer.Napoleon Bonaparte as Emperor of France did a lot of good things; much of the country's 'Civil Code' was instituted during his reign. But this film deals only with (a) Napoleon the warrior and (b) Napoleon the husband, and fails to deliver a well-rounded character in either sense. We know he loves France but aside from living there we don't know what drives his passion. His hatred for anything not France is clear, but the reasons for this hatred are never explained. There are battles a'plenty but the reason for them is elusive. Enemies become friends. Friends become enemies. We care about none of them. Thousands die. Somehow we care nothing about them either.There is, in Napoleon, no one to root for. Making matters worse there is an uneven performance by Joaquin Phoenix. His 'later' Napoleon becomes a different character than we'd seen earlier in the film. And no, I don't think it is attributed to Napoleon's rise in power. I think it's Phoenix; his acting, his portrayal. His Napoleon is far less quirky as the film progresses (as though the actor wants out of his role), and in this way, he is far less interesting.If there's anyone about whom we do care that character would be Josephine, Napoleon's wife and Empress of France. Vanessa Kirby is ravishing in the role. A rare beauty but one with a shadow-filled past as well as future. We can understand Napoleon's undying love her but the truth is, she's not the nicest girl on the block. There's little doubt that Mr. Bonaparte would never have 'won' her, were he not the country's future leader. So, again, no one to truly root for.Ah, yes. The battle scenes. They're fine (though it seems as though a battle fought at the base of Egypt's pyramids was cut out). But I think fewer battles and more unraveling of the reasons behind those battles between France, England, Russia, Austria, and other countries might make the remaining battles more meaningful.More involving.Which, as I said, this film is definitely not."
"Napoleon","Eleatic67","2 March 2024",610,"The success of any film depends mostly on the script. Why Scott would initiate such an expensive project without ensuring a refined and sophisticated script is a mystery. I'm not convinced there is a single interesting scene that provides insight into the characters or captures through language the prevailing political ideas. Scott's frequent missteps as a director reflect a greater interest in the cinematic rather than in the dramatic. However, this seems inevitable when your priority is delivering a blockbuster that will have broad appeal instead of digging deeper into culture, society, or history. A colossal waste of an extraordinary opportunity to create an important film about a fascinating historical figure."
"Napoleon","Vic_max","22 November 2023",610,"Many of Ridley Scott's movies are like visual masterpieces with epic storylines. I was sort of expecting something like Gladiator. Instead, it was just ""meh"" - I probably would have quit watching if it was on TV.Joaquin Phoenix has demonstrated that he can play odd or troubled characters well, but I don't think he was a good choice for Napoleon. He made the character seem more bizarre than charismatic or leader-like. I think the strongest and most interesting character was actually Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) ... who will probably get the most traction from the movie.The story itself wasn't that interesting because it wasn't explained that well. For example, his departure from Elba island seemed to randomly happen without much explanation. The elevation to a monarch-like role also happens without much explanation. It's like you're watching snippets of a bigger, more interesting story.I become so disconnected from the story that I almost fell asleep during some of the long battle sequences.The movie would probably have been better if it captured just one pivotal event or time period ... or better yet, if it had been a miniseries. While I will still look forward to any future movie from Scott, Napoleon deserved better."
"Napoleon","epicking","23 November 2023",310,"Im only focused on the historical aspect here ... and I only mentions a couple of out many hereIn the beginning, Napoleon abandons a battle at the Egyptian pyramids because Joséphine is unfaithful at home in Paris. It is pure fiction.Much later, when the two have divorced, he marches on Paris from his famous exile on the island of Elba, because he is jealous that the Russian Tsar Alexander is apparently taking a swing with Joséphine. From whom Napoleon, by the way, has long since divorced.It is a distortion of history of the worst kind. Joséphine dies of pneumonia in 1814. Napoleon first marches on Paris in 1815 to regain power, a wild story that could be a whole movie in itself.If you´re gonna make an expensive movie like this, get things right instead of just making romantic stuff up."
"Napoleon","LongTimeMovieLover","23 November 2023",410,"First, let me get this out of the way. If you want to watch a focused masterpiece, watch Waterloo with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. It could have only been better (for me) if Steiger had a French accent. Second, if you want to watch a general scoping history of Napoleon, consider the excellent and approachable Napoleon series with Christian Clavier (with a French accent), Isabella Rossallini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu. (Clavier is sometimes unfairly maligned when indeed he does a splendid job in my view.) There are other well-reputed less approachable versions, but these two are excellent.Now, as this work, let's start with Napoleon. A boyishly handsome, philosophically grounded (Napoleonic Code), egotistical, pugnacious genius, sometimes brooding sometimes loving, sometimes playing. That is, a strategically gifted, tactically trained, boyishly handsome, egotistical, passionate, lovable, fighting, moody, young genius.I am sorry, but this character requires someone like a young Brando or Pacino. Phoenix simply cannot, no-way, pull it off. Way wrong. Crazy wrong. He does not have the range. He is a great actor only in a particular type of role, a crouching villainous Caesar or a depressive Joker. A melancholic low-key whispering introverted Napoleon does not work, and some form of delusion by Scott allowed or put Phoenix into this role. I can easily get past failure of boyish good looks and the way wrong age (and Napoleon's young age is part of the story itself). But I cannot get past whispering tone and failure of charisma, passion and charm. Napoleon seduced a lot of people in a lot of ways.It's not Phoenix's fault he was miscast. Way miscast. Vanessa Kirby was fine and did her job. But, no one in this movie deserves any acting nominations. Take one common scene, being the ""Will you shoot your emperor?"" following Napoleon's escape from Elba and return to France, the other referenced Napoleons had timing, tension, and drama, here blah, nothing. Nothing! It's just bad. Really bad.Nothing in this movie taught me anything, made me think, made me feel, or moved me in any way. Terribly unengaging. Even the couple attempts at comic relief (if there would have been any tension, which was devoid) it was misplaced and failed miserably.Now, let's talk about the versions. This is the 2.5H version and there is another 4H version to be released by Apple+. Everything is a gimmick these days. Every streaming channel has one gem, but I'll suggest this work is inherently flawed by miscast Phoenix and more time to blend the scenes won't do it. In this 2.5H version, it's like a bunch of scenes without any context. We go from the French Revolution through the Reign of Terror through Napoleon's coup through Austerlitz through first defeat through Elba through return to France through Waterloo, through St. Helena. In 2.5H, even with the right actor who has engaging charisma and charm, it's too much ground. No character development whatsoever. None. Even in 4H it's like getting two bad suits for the price of one. It's just more of what's bad, which is miscast Phoenix in the titular role. I only understood the movie because I love and know the history. My wife and 86 year old father could not follow it, and my 19 year old daughter (somewhat tired from returning from college) dozed off a couple of times. No one liked the movie. And we even went out of our way to the IMAX because, well, it was Napoleon.I almost forgot to mention the emasculation of Napoleon by Josephine, the jarring politically correct now-required social normalizing casting of extras, and the ending credits that count the dead but give no context for the concomitant social reforms.Braveheart was historically all wrong, but it was still a great story with a wonderful score. This Napoleon is a bad story, and, even if Napoleon was a fictional character it was still bad. It's both a bad reflection of a real man, a grossly incomplete historical depiction, and a bad story poorly told no matter what.Napoleon was loved, hated, admired and ridiculed, by many of the same people, at different times. He was, if nothing else, one of the greatest characters in the recorded history of mankind. To try to do it all fairly, with the wrong titular actor, is silly. Really silly. Delusively silly.Sir Ridley's movie The Last Duel failed for a similar reason, and then he blames the audience. It's not the production or even perhaps the precise movie direction that is going wrong, it's that the story itself is not well-told. Perhaps it's time for him to teach his tactical craft to a young person with the right vision for the story expression.I need to watch my Waterloo DVD again to get my head back to the right flavor of Napoleon the Great, not Napoleon the Whisperer.Nothing good, new or better. A waste of my time and money."
"Napoleon","heisenberg12","23 November 2023",510,"The title says it all. When anyone thinks about Napolean, they automatically think of the general, the egomaniacal conquerer, military genius who glorified and unified France after the French Revolution.So going into an ""epic"" 2 hour and 40 minute movie, you would safely assume we'd get a glimpse into that twisted, genius mind, especially from an actor like Phoenix, right?Wrong. Instead we get practically a two hour, unoriginal portrait of his banal relationship with Josephine; yes, the rest of the 45 minutes are indeed battles that were good, not great. The lopsided focus on Josephine is unwarranted and unjustified, merely because we didn't learn anything new that we couldn't already assume if it only featured a half hour with their relationship on screen. Honestly, I still cannot fathom any point in that narrative decision after enduring it, as again, there were no twists or startling revelations; if the point was to just humanize Napoleon, we get it, he had a wife and dealt with her toxicity.The best part of the entire movie was the very end when the biographical title cards came up and revealed what a bloodlusting monster he really was, with the visceral explanation of the vast amount of lives he lost in his vain conquests. Back then, the world population was exponentially less than today. Three million in less than twenty years over 61 campaigns, with the Russian incursion costing three hundred plus thousand alone, seventy thousand at Waterloo. It's a shame that most of the tone of the movie not only was wasted on his love life, but moreso did not depict him as the maniacal sociopath he clearly was.On a side note, since we're delving into European French history and this piece failed to capture the period well enough, future filmmakers should hone in on the actual French Revolution. Tale of Two Cities, anyone? Nolan would crush it!4.5/10."
"Napoleon","malmevik77","25 November 2023",210,"NapoleonLet's start with the good things. The battle scenes are well shot, exciting, horrifying, the excellent work one can expect from a Ridley Scott movie.Josephine was fantastic. Her situation was clearly not ideal, and the actress portrayed her in such a way that I felt more for her than anyone else in the film.Now the bad things. All of it. This movie was not good at all. It was such a disappointment. This film had major problems with the flow of the story. It was extremely disjointed. I had no understanding of what was happening as it felt like someone took an outline and only filmed the bullet points, and not the detail beneath it. There is no transition from the coup in 1799 to the coronation in 1804. There is no explanation. There is no context as to how and why this was even acceptable.And don't get me started on historical inaccuracies. The very first scene shows Marie Antoinette getting beheaded in 1789 when that amazing invention called google can tell you otherwise.Maybe I'm being a bit harsh but I've studied English and French history quite extensively and it was cringe worthy to watch. Joaquin Phoenix was also very much miscast. I felt sorry for Vanessa Kirby as she was the highlight of the film. In all honesty, this film should have been called Josephine.I do not recommend watching this unless you're just there for the well shot battle scenes. The lake scene will give you chills. This film was a huge disappointment and I felt embarrassed for the filmmakers."
"Napoleon","itsahoverboard","23 November 2023",510,"Yes, that's a real quote from Joaquin Phoenix to Ridley Scott right before they started filming. I love Joaquin Phoenix, but you can really tell that he doesn't ""get"" the character of Napoleon that he's trying to play. I honestly don't know if Phoenix even has that kind of charisma and confidence within him, but then again I don't know anything about Napoleon either. But it was just uncomfortable watching him stumble his way through the movie, often just looking clueless.The other problem with the movie is it's just plain dull and uninteresting. It really does feel like a ""highlights"" movie. For an almost 3-hour film, it has surprisingly little dialogue. The dialogue that's there isn't' that illuminating or interesting. I normally like politics and romance (which is the bulk of this story), but I would have loved to see more military and war stuff in a movie like this. Isn't Napoleon supposed to be a brilliant war leader? There's like none of that here. Except ""oh we'll do a sneak attack in the night.""The cinematography was also really surprisingly dull. It looked super digital. The colors were so bland and washed out.Vanessa Kirby is really the best thing about the movie. And also the first battle taking over that fort, which was admittedly pretty epic. I have never seen such a thing happen to a horse in a movie, and it was wonderfully horrifying.I fully blame Ridley Scott for this dud. Hopefully Spielberg's Kubrick miniseries about Napoleon will be much better."
"Napoleon","zeki-4","22 November 2023",710,"Back in 2005 Ridley Scott's 144 minute version of 'Kingdom of Heaven' premiered in theatres to somewhat mixed reviews. A couple of years later the vastly superior 190 minute director's cut version finally arrived, with the general consensus that the final product was a masterclass in storytelling, directing, acting and cinematography. - without doubt the best motion picture ever made about the crusades.Almost 20 years later we are yet again treated with a compiled highlight reel of a Ridley Scott movie in the theatre, rather than a full-fledged historical epic, since it has already become official that 'Napoleon' will be released later on streaming with its entire runtime of almost four hours, which clearly is needed to flesh out many parts of the movie and fill in the emotional and historical blanks, because this - somewhat butchered cut - moves in a breakneck speed and feels too rushed.Whereas the underappreciated 1970 movie 'Waterloo' starring Rod Steiger as Napoleon Bonaparte, featuring thousands of extras, portrayed events only during the 100 days campaign in 1815, Scott's 'Napoleon' takes us through decades of various major events and battles beginning with the siege of Toulon in 1793. In this version we never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful. Why did he win the admiration of so many? It's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in real life, but here he is portrayed as a childish brute? It felt like the focus was more on setpieces and his troubled relationship with Josephine, than on him as a ruthless and cunning emperor, and in the theatre cut there really isn't a lot of places where Joaquin Phoenix truly shines as an Oscar contender. Maybe the director's cut will remedy that.In spite of its shortcomings (no pun intended) 'Napoleon' is still one of the best movies I have seen this year, but I am baffled. Because if people can sit through 3+ hour box office hits like 'Avengers Endgame', 'Avatar 2' and 'Oppenheimer' - why the need to release just a very extended trailer of 'Napoleon' in the theatre, especially when everyone know that they can just wait a couple of months for it to arrive on streaming in its entirety? An attempt by Apple at a cash grab? ""You need a subscription to our streaming service to watch the whole thing""?With that being said, I do predict some Oscar nominations here. Ridley Scott yet again proves why he is one of the best filmmakers out there. But a word of caution: If you only plan to see this once, you might consider waiting for the director's cut."
"Napoleon","gcarpiceci","22 November 2023",510,"History is an undesired guest taking the backseat in Mr Scott's sprawling epic on Napoleon's life.Mr Scott's craftsmanship is such that it's undoubtedly able to offer the viewer some unique experiences. But stunning battle visuals and great performances by the lead actors don't make up for gross historical approximation.I have no doubt whatsoever that Mr Scott knows his history and, if he didn't, he surely has a fat staff of assistants to tell it to him; so what he does here (as he did already in Gladiator) is a very deliberate and blatant choice to bend historical reality to the purposes of his own art, which looks like an act of unforgivable artistic hubris."
"Napoleon","richard-1787","27 November 2023",310,"This movie must have cost a fortune to make. (There is no budget listed yet here on IMDB.) You would think they could have spent a little of it on a good script. So many of the problems here stem from the bad script, which does not provide clues about what it going on.What we get is several large-scale but very unexciting battle scenes, where we watch the infantry march into suicidal battle, sometimes led by the cavalry, sometimes followed. In a movie about a fabled tactician, there is no discussion of what made him a success, what he did differently, etc.In between the battle episodes are some of the least romantic, un-erotic love scenes ever filmed. Phoenix and his leading lady have absolutely NO chemistry whatsoever. Half the time he is like a statue with her, the other half like an over-eager dog. We never get a hint of what he might see in her.I stayed through the whole 2.5 hours because I was with friends. Otherwise I would have left mid-way through, or fallen asleep - as Napoleon does several times himself during the battle scenes.I saw Oppenheimer, which is a full three hours long, three times last summer, and was riveted to it all three times. That movie was well directed. This movie didn't hold me at all, had no pacing, and was sometimes confusing even though I have studied that period of French history.Some will find fault with historical inaccuracies. There are evidently a fair number of them. But that doesn't bother me. What bothered me was that Scott and his crew never made this story come alive. Why spend all that money and all those resources on something that just is not interesting?"
"Napoleon","rachelnstephens","22 November 2023",410,"If I knew nothing of Napoleon, I'd be utterly confused about what was happening in this film. There is no hero's journey to follow and nobody to root for.Who is Napoleon? Why is he in France? How did he get to his position? The film begins with the death of Marie Antoinette and pretty much dives right into Napoleon being in charge somehow. Why Napoleon? No idea.Early on we meet Josephine's minor son who is never seen again on screen after a one-on-one meeting with Napoleon. Why does Napoleon meet with him? Why does he grant his request? Why is he interested in Josephine? No idea.The film feels as if you're a time traveller who is moving forward to different snapshots of Napoleon's life. There's little context or explanation. Lots of battle scenes, troop movement, flag signaling and even smelting to make munitions but not a lot of context. Why is Napoleon going here or there? No idea. What is his end goal? No idea. Why do Napoleon's men have an affinity for him? No idea.There are large spans of time between scenes so suddenly Josephine's daughter is a grown adult speaking with Napoleon. No clue who she was until Napoleon mentioned Josephine being her mother. Who are all of these people? No idea. How are they connected? No idea.The film is beautifully shot. The costuming is perfection. The set design is dreamy. Nobody can say that Ridley Scott doesn't know how to make a movie or that Joaquin Phoenix isn't a fantastic actor - it's simply a poor script."
"Napoleon","WadoodS","22 November 2023",510,"Making a movie on a charismatic person like Napoleon is a huge undertaking. It requires in-depth study of his life and then choosing specific events of his life to show and connecting them to perfection. The film maker is short in time therefore it is important for the movie to be precise, fluent and with a purpose. In this movie, the director, Ridley Scott, fails to determine which points of his life he wishes to portray and consequently it results in a piece-by-piece movie which lacks cinematic flow and confuses the audience.The movie disappoints in showing the battles, only briefly does it show the battles of Toulon and Austerlitz and then a bit longer Waterloo, of course concentrating more on Wellington's genius rather than Napoleon's side of things, where there is no mention of Marshal Grouchy's failed mission to block Blucher's army from joining the battle.As great an actor as Joaquin Phoenix is, he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. I felt like Napoleon was intentionally mimicked by the film maker to portray him as a socially awkward person who does not know his way around women, or even his soldiers who loved him so much. During the coup d'etat he is seen as a confused ""coward"" who escapes for his life and is only saved by the cleverness of his brother. But I have personally grown up around military personnel who are calm and composed in the face of adversity and prudently handle critical situations which makes it even more incredible that a military genius of Napoleon's stature would cower under pressure.Joaquin Phoenix's character lacks fundamental personal charisma which is so evident in leaders in general, and military leaders specifically. The movie fails to communicate why then the most civilized, liberal people on the planet earth during that time followed this uncharismatic, bland leader in 61 of his battles? French had already beheaded their king, and all French men were citizens with equal rights - at least only men. No other country in Europe has achieved this level of self-consciousness for human freedom at that time. There is also no mention of his civil, political, artistic achievements like the Code Napoleon or the great artists that flourished under him.Joaquin Phoenix is himself or rather he is still in his Joker character. Apparently, he didn't try enough to get into Napoleon's character. Look at Marlon Brando for example, who shines in his role as Napoleon. Joaquin is so one dimensional who seems to be asleep all the time and has no idea what he is doing while the real Napoleon was an energetic, charismatic, young, and quick individual.I tried to get over his age difference as he is too old to portray such a young person. Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined. He was 35 when he was crowned Emperor of the French. Joaquin Phoenix looks in his fifties in the whole movie. Vanessa Kirby's young age doesn't help much as Josephine was 6 years older. Vanessa Kirby plays brilliantly in her role and dominated every scene she was in as a cold, unfaithful, and then heart-broken queen.It was a brilliant opportunity wasted by the film makers. It could have been much better - as the brilliant life story is already there. The music could have been better. They should have used one of those music/sound directors Christopher Nolan uses in his movies. The cinematography was very good though. The battle scenes were filmed well. My friend pointed out that the cinematographer found his favorite angle on Vaness Kirby when they were in their private bedroom. I laughed more at this joke than at any ""funny"" moments in the movie. Overall, it is a below average movie. Don't go there with your hopes held high. I think Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie. Now I am not sure I will watch the director's cut. I am looking forward to a young, energetic director taking this enterprise and making a Braveheart-like movie."
"Napoleon","M_Exchange","22 November 2023",510,"As many of you know, Stanley Kubrick was obsessed with Napoleon, and he wanted to make his magnum opus about him near the end of his life. He never got around to it. I would have loved to have seen that film.This film is not a total disappointment, but it's far from great. I fell in love with its visuals, and I felt as if I was in the era of the 1790's/early 1800's. Its war scenes are good. Also, I appreciate that it does not hit the three hour mark, but it felt choppy and often incomplete. For instance, when Napoleon got punished a couple of times for his defeats one might think that he cut straight from a loss to a meeting with foreign dignitaries. In actuality, things were much messier in between.I never really felt a romantic spark between him and his first wife, and I never really felt much emotion ever throughout the entirety of the film. Even his death was rather anticlimactic and weak.I would recommend this film only to French people and history buffs."
"Napoleon","dorMancyx","22 November 2023",610,"I feel unsatisfied walking out of that theater after three hours of melancholy and confusion. I understand every single word and every single scene, but when they connect into a whole film I don't understand anything. To start off, the costume/production design, naturalistic sceneries, the two meticulously-depicted ancient warfares --- one amid the doleful squall of Austerlitz and another atop the dampened prairie of Waterloo --- and all other technical stuff are spotless. However, there's an anxiety-inducing problem with the narrative --- the movie has no focus. No climax, no resonating themes like Oppenheimer, just one plain, linear, chronological plot; and even that we get multiple baffling time jumps throughout. The plot is so simple that everything in the film was taught in my AP World History class last year in one day, except it nibbles on some superficial details. Highlighting the relationship between Napolean and Josephine is a unique take, and I do see efforts from the two esteemed performers to capture their mutual toxicity and intricacy, but this love story has barely anything to do with the movie's main arc, Napolean's personal rise and fall. Nothing! Two basically unrelated storylines unfolding in the most bland way possible. Also adding to this insipid mess is the score, which is composed primarily of classical or really old-sounding French folk --- what happened to Radiohead from the trailer? God Ridley I don't wanna say three hours of my life is wasted but it kinda is!I didn't think it was possible but, I think Oppenheimer's winning the Oscar."
"Napoleon","theRetiree","22 November 2023",410,"Just came from a full theater. At the end we got up and left in dead silence. No plot except broad strokes of history, little dialog, no passion, Phoenix seemed catatonic, and the movie was nothing more than set pieces posed to look like romantic paintings by Jacques-Louis David (who actually conveyed more emotion and spirit ). The early climax was Austerlitz, which Scott tried to stage as a replay of the destruction of the Teutonic Knights in Alexander.Nevsky. Wikipedia says maybe two of three soldiers (of thousands of casualties) died in the frozen ponds.Waterloo was equally lame, with French cavalry trying unsuccessfully to break the British Squares looking ridiculously like Plains Indians riding in circles attacking a wagon train. (Mel Brooks staged that better.) And Blucher's timely last minute arrival (which Wellington described as a ""near run thing"") had no tension and no suspense.Beautiful costumes and sets, a case of thousands, but unsatisfying either as historical spectacle or grand love affair, with Phoenix and the director both giving new meaning to the expression ""phoning it in."""
"Napoleon","jozenerd","26 November 2023",310,"During this movie, I just felt like watching a Monty Python's version of Napoleon or a BBC special based on a flyer they took on a train station about Napoleon's affairs and life troubles. Once again, Scott is making out his version of the history or the history that goes with his religion and political views. About Joaquin Phoenix's acting, it's sometimes laughable ala Eddie Redmayne on Jupiter Ascending, Halle Berry on Catwoman, or Marion Cotillard's death scene on Batman, that bad!!! Gosh, this movie is a reminder of past glories that are far gone and Mr. Scott is not deceiving me once again. He did it once with Covenant, guess who did it again? Not Britney!"
"Napoleon","nlcckc","23 November 2023",210,"So here is a film about one of the greatest warlords of history, and what do you suppose it emphasizes? If your guess is the yucky ""relationship"" he had with Josephine, you're not far from the truth.Here's what this movie contains:
dark, murky lighting throughoutNapoleon waving his arm and magic happening on the battlefieldStupid and gratuitous sex, like watching a couple of dogsLong closeups of Napoleon's face twitchingWhat it does not contain:
A plotAn editorAny idea of why Napoleon succeeded and then failedAny meaningful and/or normal relationshipsHistorical accuracyAvoid at all costs."
"Napoleon","OwneyH","23 November 2023",110,"This was one of the worst big budget movies I have ever seen. I made it toward the later half of the movie and everyone had already walked out, I decided to also walk out. It was the first film I ever walked out on. Here is why:Napoleon opens with what is seemingly going to be a historical biography film adaptation of Napoleon's life, what you instead get is a poorly made, half attempt at a comedy. That's not an exaggeration, it really does play out like a half attempted comedy that's neither funny nor entertaining.It starts in the French Revolution, the first problems was Joaquin Phoenix. I never thought he was a bad actor, but he's bad in this movie. Not only is he a bad Napoleon, not only is he way older looking than actual Napoleon (who is supposed to be 24 at the start of the film), but it's like he didn't even wanna play the role. I don't know what he was going for here but what we got is a bumbling fool with no confidence in any regard, no sign of intelligence, no backstory, no character development, no knowledge of his life outside of his marriage, and above all no historical accuracy whatsoever.This isn't only Joaquin Phoenix's fault, it's Ridley Scott and writer David Scarpa too. Everyone failed this project.If what you were looking for is a film about the Napoleonic Wars, look elsewhere. There is almost no war in it, and what little war there was, is only little clips of warfare, and then straight back to Napoleon's marriage life. Even if you found the marriage stuff interesting about Napoleon, this still isn't the movie for you, because it's not accurate and the film makes it's point early on, but for some reason they keep going over the same ground already covered about Napoleon's love life. It get's very repetitive and quite frankly, boring.These clips of combat we get are completely disconnected from the story, it looks like it's randomly thrown in. They're also really short. If you remember, the trailer has combat in Egypt. You see all that combat in the trailer, that's it. There's no more of it. The trailer was better than the movie.As a history buff (especially history on the French Revolution/Napoleonic Wars) and a film buff, it comes off as offensive to the entire subject matter it's covering in history, offensive to the entire art form of filmmaking, and offensive to the intelligence of it's viewer.It takes nothing seriously, all these huge events regardless of your opinion is treated with disrespect.But most historical events are absent from this film. It focuses so heavily on this marriage story that you don't care about it because the film never tried to make you care, to the point where you feel shocked to see how much time has passed and how many events they skipped when you finally see a date pop up on the screen or an actual recognizable event.Or if you don't know Napoleonic history, you will be entirely lost as to what's happening because it explains nothing, it doesn't even mention why the Napoleonic Wars is happening at all. It doesn't even cover Napoleon growing as a general. Or even growing as a person. The look of Napoleon is even lazily done in this.This version of Napoleon is such a fool instead of a smart general, he makes Napoleon Dynamite look like a cool, collected, Chad.From a film making perspective, the movie is horribly made, generic to bad camera work, a bland soundtrack, HORRIBLE writing, a plot that goes nowhere.The only positives I can find is that some of the costume design is good, the sets are pretty well made, and the one scene in the trailer with the ice was cool. But I'd say watch the trailer again instead of the movie. But that's it. Those are the only good things.If you like Napoleon you won't like this, if you hate Napoleon you won't like this. If you like history you won't like this. If you don't care about history you won't like this. It's poorly made and boring for all. Find any other Napoleon focused movie and I'm sure it will be more entertaining.The trailer makes it seem like a different movie. I feel scammed, I feel lied to.A history film about the Napoleonic Wars with no history, no Napoleonic Wars, and an inaccurate Napoleon that's not fun to watch and at times straight up cringe to witness, makes this movie a solid 1. No entertainment value."
"Napoleon","gmznffvs","22 November 2023",310,"Napoleon is one of the greatest characters in history. He came out of the ashes of the French Revolution to not only lead the country but to inspire it. People were given new hope, aspirations and above all opportunities.Bonaparte created the first meritocracy in Europe. Ordinary people rose to positions of significance in the arts, sciences and all walks of life. In his army almost all the generals came from ordinary backgrounds, whereas pre the Revolution they were aristos.Not one person who doesn't know about Napoleon will know any of this when they come out of the movie.There is nothing to give an insight to his motivation Hint, it wasn't all for Josephine. There was no politics. None of the brilliant generals who fought with him get a look in. Bernadot was invited to be king of Sweden! Talleyrand was a self serving rat, but here is a nobody.Even the election of his brothers to the thrones of other European countries is not worth a mention.Napoleon enjoyed his power. Phoenix mopes about with his usual stone face making every day seem a chore.The only good part, worth the three stars is Waterloo, which is a good battle scene, if not by any means perfect, but watching the move from line to square was satisfying.Now people will think this morose dull man was Napoleon. How could he have been? Why would the French have loved him? Why would they welcome him back.What a disappointment."
