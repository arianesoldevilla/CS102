"X","gortx","31 March 2022",NA,"Ti West's movie really should have been called ""E"" for elevated. It sets itself up as a smart take on the slasher films of the 70s and early 80s. As a bonus, the film within a film has the filmmakers making an 'elevated' porn flick (as a bonus, actor Owen Campbell who plays the ""Director"" even looks a bit like Director Tobe Hooper).Quite consciously taking it's set up from Tobe Hooper's 1974 TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, X has a group of randy pornographers renting a farmhouse from an elderly couple in the middle of nowhere in Texas (actually New Zealand). Writer-Director West's main idea here is to set up a contrast between the XXX filmmakers and the bible thumping civilians of the area. It's not an uninteresting idea, which, of course, plays off the the puritanical cliche in the slasher films of yore where the most sexually active characters are the most likely to g et killed off. In addition to MASSACRE, West includes nods to FRIDAY THE 13TH, Hooper's EATEN ALIVE and a very specific one to HALLOWEEN. X is set about 5 years after MASSACRE so that it can include a brief exchange about how home video will change the porno industry (adult films were already available on VHS for about 3 years).The movie is very well directed, with savvy use of cross-cutting between the porn film in the making and the terrors that await the group. Mia Goth (in a dual role; actually a triple if you stay after the credits) and Brittany Snow are the two pornstars to be and each dive in with relish. Kid Cudi is the cocky stud, while Martin Henderson is solid as the confidant Producer. Jenna Ortega is the ""crew"" all by her lonesome (she manages to keep her clothes on - must have a better agent). Stephen Ure is the ornery old man who rents out his guest house.As good as the filmmaking is, X ends up feeling too studied. The pacing is lugubrious even if it picks up towards the very end. Once the massacre begins (if not by power tools) it still ends up being fairly typical of the films it's commenting on, regardless of how well executed and 'elevated' it thinks it is. It's also too drawn out to satisfy some gore-hounds and once the blood starts flowing, probably too gross for the internet scribes dreaming of doing extended online essays dissecting it for it's elevated intellect. There are a couple of twists, but they aren't sufficient enough to compensate for the predictability.In the end, it's not as clever as West thinks it is, and despite some good Directing chops and acting, it's simply too self-conscious to be much of a fun thrill ride."
"X","johannes2000-1","16 March 2022",810,"I liked it. It's a nice old-fashioned (flawlessly 70's styled) slasher horror-flick, with a fairly original premise. As in any comparable horror movie the motives for the killings are pretty farfetched, but who cares, when they are pictured so relentlessley gruesome, the gore here is definitely not for the tender-hearted. Another strong point is how the movie very gradually builds up the tension, this is a real slow burner, the apprehension of looming doom is palpable throughout the movie. This is helped by a strong direction, a very clever and inventive editing, and some great photography, see for instance the scene of one of the girls swimming in the lake, while... well, I won't give it away, but it's beautiful and hair-raisingly scary at the same time!Add to all this some very funny dialogues and goings-on at the start, and you're in for a well made, old-school horror flick, maybe not life-changing but absolutely entertaining for those who can apprciate this kind of movie (like me!)."

"X","miles670","15 April 2022",710,"I didn't know what to expect going into this movie. Some reviews said it was porn with some horror, some said it was a slasher B movie. Some said decent acting and a good gore fest.It was all of the above, though I'd say less porn, there are some nude/sex scenes but they're really not the heart of the movie. The gore is well done, the acting is very good I think, and the overall slasher aspect is reasonable, though it could have been a little more creative.Saying all of that none of it is what I'll remember this movie for. What really struck me in this movie was the portrayal of age and how it affects people and their relationships, I actually felt really sad for some of the characters in this movie, and that isn't usually how I'd expect to feel watching a slasher. It really did feel like the writers, directors,. And actors were trying to remind us of something whilst also making a decent slasher. I think it's to value our youth, and our lives as much as we can. I don't want to say much more as I don't want to spoil the movie.

"X","aidanratesmovies","2 April 2022",610,"An interesting slow burn, but without enough to make it stand against the countless other slasher films, X is a fine film and another tribute to the iconic genre that made horror so popular in the first place. Granted, I do enjoy myself a slasher film from time to time- I'm quite fond of films like Nightmare on Elm Street and My Bloody Valentine, but where X faults among the others is through using a rather familiar formula without any true unique purpose. Throughout the film the characters often talk about an X factor, something that makes Mia Goth's character special and starworthy- but unlike its mentionings- this film just doesn't have that. The acting is really good, I love the underrated Mia Goth as always- as well as Brittany Snow, Martin Henderson, and even Kid Cudi did a rather impressive job. The cinematography is fantastic and perfectly fits the amitpshere and tone the film is going for. The music is enjoyable and tense, and its pacing can be a bit slow at times, but does allow for an interesting point of view. Its main problem lies solely in its script, which revolves largely around a smut film production- but takes too many elements and formulaic tendencies from other horror films like Evil Dead, Friday the 13th, The Visit and most obviously Texas Chainsaw Massacre to really stand out on its own and become its own thing. In the end, its not a bad watch, I wouldn't watch it again, but I certainly didn't mind watching it. It isn't the most memorable, but I certainly don't have any disdain for it. It just could have been more, especially given the talent involved, but ironically it settled for less.My Rating: 5.8/10."
"X","fpcholcomb","29 November 2023",210,"I love the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I love it for its idiosyncrasies, its low budget ingenuity, its colorful villains, its charming flaws. That being said, I would not describe the Texas Chainsaw Massacre as high art. It is effectively schlock, good schlock, but schlock none the less. Schlock works when it is fun and creative, when it engages the viewer in its excesses. Schlock can, however, be elevated by a dedicated artist's vision, and that is what X attempts to do. It takes an established style and plot structure from B-movie horror of the past, now nostalgic in its appeal, and attempts to do three things, pay homage to those classics, elevate the material through artistic directing techniques not contemplated by the older films, and to talk about societies relationship to sex, youth, and religion in broad strokes. On all three accounts X is a failure.The film is not wholly without charm. Mia Goth is fantastic as the lead and the rest of the performances are solid. There are some beautiful shots, and the director has the courage to take some real chances with how he presents the intentionally textbook material. That is where my praise ends.The heart of the film is disappointing. Beautiful shots are ruined by the films tedious attempts to foreshadow its overbearing message. A perfect example is when Mia Goth's character, alone, goes for a swim in some stagnant water that is serene, yet ominous. Up to this point the film has been cultivating a relatively tense atmosphere through uncomfortable interactions with an elderly couple who owns the property where the rest of the characters are trying to surreptitiously film a porno. The scene didn't need blatant danger to feel creepy, but it instead elects to add a crocodile slowly following the main character bluntly foreshadowing danger in an incredibly cheap and contrived way. She is prey, and yet any audience member already knows that. They know X is a horror film. They know the old couple is evil because they are put in so much makeup and prosthetics that they hardly look human. The film is not clever when it moves slowly and blatantly shouts what it is attempting to do.Combined with the otherwise banal plot it's telegraphed unfolding, X also has much to say about sex, religion, and personhood, but it is so shallow in its interpretations of these concepts. In trying to be deep in comes across as shallow.Spoiler ahead, but the elderly woman's bloodlust is essentially fueled by her inability to feel desirable since she has aged. Her husband can no longer play the part of her romantic lover as the way she needs. She longs for the youth that the other characters have, and all the sexual and personal freedom it gives. The gang, on the other hand, are young and cocky and seek to leverage their youth to gain wealth and fame. They are vain people who are pretending to have deeper connection than they actually have (one girl talks about faking her interest during scenes, while the head honcho talks about all women being the same, etc., the film is never subtle). Mia Goth's character, while the softest spoken, still harps about how she wants to be successful above all else, like she deserves the fame she believes appearing in pornography will bring.The commentary here completely lacks nuance. These people don't inspire sympathy, but they don't deserve their fate. The film seems to critique old conservative forms of sex, yet the main thrust of the film is that making a porno and youthful hubris gets many people killed. The main character leaves the carnage at the end, but rather than relief at a quick getaway (a la Texas Chainsaw Massacre) she feels like John Wayne esq hero leaving victorious, which made little sense. To make matters worse the kills are boring. I found the first murder unbearably artsy in a way that felt unearned, and the rest were total duds, with one possible exception. The film wants to make art of gruesome murders, but also kills a lot of people in very anticlimactic and visually unappealing ways (quick gunshots, underwater and unseen deaths).Maybe some people will be taken with the shot composition and retro feel combined with a modern shooting style, but in my opinion a film needs a lot more than vapid exploration of themes along with a nostalgic style to be interesting or entertaining.X's ultimate sin is it lacked the charm of the slashers of the past, and in trying to innovate within the genre completely missed the point of it."
"X","Leofwine_draca","2 November 2022",310,"X (2022) is a recent horror from Ti West that feels like a homage to THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE complete with '70s trappings and grindhouse feel. The story is about the actors and crew of a low budget porn shoot heading to a remote cabin owned by a couple of oldsters. All goes well until nightfall, when murderous intentions arise and things soon turn into a night of terror. I hadn't liked West's CABIN FEVER 2 or HOUSE OF THE DEVIL and didn't expect to like this either, and - surprise! - I hated it.It's not a slow burner (for a change) but it is void of horror content, or any interesting content at all really. For the first hour nothing happens apart from time-wasting with annoying characters, bad dialogue, and endless sex scenes that smack of padding. In the last 45 minutes it becomes a fairly gory but unconvincing slasher, with bad makeup and more cliches than you can shake a stick at. It's the film's senselessness that really got to me, like the female crew member who suddenly decides she wants to star in the shoot. Yeah, okay, that would happen."
"X","Horror_Flick_Fanatic","20 March 2022",510,"While I knew this film was presented as a slasher film going in, I had better expectations given it was an A24 Studios film. Despite some of the famous names in the cast, I wouldn't consider it good. Probably my least favorite from the A24 films. The film is made in the cinematography style of classic 1970s slasher films, but it holds back on the brutality with the females. I really wished A24 was above PC culture.True 70s slasher/horror films were very brutal with both genders but not this one except perhaps with the old woman/zomb-et at the end.I was hoping at least a slightly smarter screenplay given it is A24, but disappointingly no. Mia Goth was probably the only likable character in the film. But I feel the special effects people overdid the prosthetics with the old couple. They resemble zombie monsters far more than the elderly. They could have placed a real elderly couple in there instead. Yes, the film does have some gore and blood but its predominately a very tame film. The worst of it all is a disembowel cow hit by a truck on the highway. It's not even part of the main story and we also see the aftermath of the accident.I don't feel the film deserves to be elevated because of the technical production. Authentic 1970s low budget B films were not technically sophisticated in camera work and lighting. The fancy lighting and best cinematographers of the time were reserved for mainstream big studio films and not low budget horror. With today's pre-fab software plugins templates for adobe software, copying the style wasn't an Einstein endeavor. Had this film been made by any other no name production studio, it would have been relegated into another Netflix Original category and not given accolades. The recent Netflix Texas Chainsaw original from 2022 is just as good a film as this one minus the famous actors."
"X","chris_rowe-881-168820","23 March 2022",210,"Don't get the positive reviews, basic acting, boring plot and genuinely pointless, the story was just so dated and predictable.The kills
Oh go into this basement
Why can't we see the hand
Oh a distraction
Three random holes in a wallSo many stupid predictable lazy outcomes. It was just a tragic mess that was slow, dull and lazy."
"X","jothishprabu","15 April 2022",110,"6 people go to an old couple's farmhouse and all but one get killed by them just because the old woman wanted to have sex and her man couldn't do it himself due to heart problems. That's it. That's the whole friggin movie!!!!! I just wasted 1 and half hours of my life jezzuzzz!!!!! Shame on a24 !!!"
"X","cadillac20","18 March 2022",810,"Paying homage to the slashers of yesteryear is nothing new, but Ti West's new movie X makes it feel fresh. He does this by primarily bringing attention to the sex parts of the genre and exploring what sex means. This is, after all, in part about a crew of people attempting to make a porno. But the sex angle goes beyond just cheap titillation. It is at the heart of the film, and West seems to be most interested in what the experience means, whether it's for love, a way to recapture youth, or getting the most out of life while one is still capable of experiencing the act.Beyond all this, though, is a fun, classically styled slasher that is equal parts titillation and slasher mayhem. Some may find the amount of nudity and sex, and heck the subject matter itself, distasteful, but for slasher fans, this will remind you of much of the early years of the genre. A lot has been made about how this is so heavily inspired by Texas Chainsaw Massacre and it's easy to see why. The majority of the film revolves around the singular location, an old farm seemingly in the middle of nowhere, Texas, ripe for plenty of slasher fun. Ti doesn't skimp on the red stuff either. While nothing gets too outlandishly creative, we do get some brutal kills with often gory results.It helps that characters are written well and likable. Despite the sleazy material they're attempting to create, they don't feel shallow or sleazy themselves. They believe in their work and the reasons for making it. While it may have been nice to get a little more depth out of them, they clearly have history and there are things hinted at that never get much development, they're at least a decent crowd of folks who are fun to be around. As for the villains, they're not quite as out there or mysterious as the trailer would lead you to believe. In fact, they're pretty grounded, but never the less creepy and tension is maintained consistently once the violence starts.If you know what the film's about, you have a pretty good idea of what to expect. It does take some unusual turns, but for me that only added to just how much the film stood on it's own. It certainly feels like a fresh entry into the slasher genre, something the genre needs. Ti West continues to make a name for himself as someone to watch out for. Have fun with this sexy, bloody good time."
"X","HorrorEnjoyer","26 May 2022",110,"After reading the plot, I expected to see a generic slasher movie, however, what I got was a boring artsy-wannabe flick, which takes itself way too seriously and ends up being devoid of soul or any kind of entertainment.After 1 HOUR of extremely slow and tedious build-up you get presented by the most pathetic horror movie villains I have seen in my entire life. Scree-writer must have a serious phobia of frail old people, because that's the only way you'll find any kind of thrills in this movie.With a pretentious façade, one might think that such a movie would at least be devoid of clichés, but they are all there - loud sound jump scares, extremely dumb victims, completely unrealistic kills, which you see coming a mile away, and one of the most pathetic endings to the slasher movie ever.Just go rewatch Texas Chainsaw Massacre - both originals and remakes are a million times more entertaining than this boring mess."
"X","Top_Dawg_Critic","23 January 2023",910,"They don't make em like this anymore. Good old-school slasher-horror flicks from the 70's and 80's. Writer, producer, director and editor Ti West was stellar in every department in this exceptionally well put together film. The cinematography was top shelf - all genres considered, and his directing was just as great. Even the score and soundtrack was the best I've heard in a very long time. All casting and performances were excellent, especially the lovely Jenna Ortega, and Mia Goth in her dual roles as Maxine Minx and granny Pearl. Kid Cudi also had some good fun being cast as Jackson Hole. The gore, prosthetics and special effects were on point. There were even some surprisingly unexpected jump-scares where you wouldn't expect them - all due to simplistic yet creative filmmaking techniques. The writing had a nice flow to it with continuity and decent pacing, so the 105 min runtime passed by comfortably. There really isn't much to negatively critique in this little gem, except I wished for more narrative and sub-plots. It's a must-see if you're a fan of this genre, and a well deserved 9/10 from me."
"X","dan_da_man-60288","7 May 2023",110,"It's a trope that slashers have some aspect of sex in them, sure, but the entire first hour of this pos is just the result of a horny director who wanteed to make porn but also wants to pretend they're making a legit movie to their friends. So they filmed bad porn and then tacked 40 mins of slasher on the end.A solid hour of just ""look she STILL has her tits out"" and ""let's have another group discussion about the morals of dating a porn star,"" followed by a kill scene set to the most cliched song to ever be in a kill scene.I get that there's some stupid nonsensical lookalike story going on with a girl and the old woman, but every time she moves in tense moments and a big rubber mask is bending in unnatural ways it pulls you right out of the immersion.The pacing is all over the place. Some scenes just go on for way too long for basically no additional payoff. Like yes, the killer is obviously emotional, but I got that from the first 10 stabs, and the next 20 just had me waiting for it to be over. Some scenes are way too blunt, having a person wander into an area and get killed in about 1 min flat.There's very little imagination in the kill scenes, which may have flown in the decade it's set, but we've had decades of slashers and can expect a bit more these days than someone blatantly holding a knife behind their back stabbing someone. I really hope nobody lost any sleep trying to write that scene."
"X","westy_captain","2 October 2022",610,"Not really a jump scare sort of deal and like if you read the little description about the movie it has all the spoilers in it already.First point, I thought it was really funny when kid Cudi was standing in the door frame and you could only see his shadowSecondly For a movie about making a porno, there were adequate number boobs shown.And the prosthetics used to make the main actor look older we're great.

They begin filming but the old guy and his wife have other plans. Soon the young people are fighting for their lives.This is a very odd film. It's a solid hour before any horror kicks in but when it does it's VERY bloody, gruesome and pretty sick. However it is well-done, the acting is good and there is plenty of female and male frontal nudity. Also I love how the opening and closing credits look like they came off an old porno flick!

This film DRAGGED the entire way through. The timing of the kills was even off. Found myself skipping through the intense scenes because you can only stab someone so many times before it looses its shock value.There is a lack of plot this entire movie other than old people wanting to yoink each other, but they are too old so they need some young people to do it for them?It's also a highly unbelievable film as they have the old couple killing couples in their 20's/30's in very mobile ways but they are introduced being very pitiful and Ill.Wanted to see why ""Pearl"" is rated so highly and this was barley talked about.

Granted, I do enjoy myself a slasher film from time to time- I'm quite fond of films like Nightmare on Elm Street and My Bloody Valentine, but where X faults among the others is through using a rather familiar formula without any true unique purpose. Throughout the film the characters often talk about an X factor, something that makes Mia Goth's character special and starworthy- but unlike its mentionings- this film just doesn't have that. The acting is really good, I love the underrated Mia Goth as always- as well as Brittany Snow, Martin Henderson, and even Kid Cudi did a rather impressive job. The cinematography is fantastic and perfectly fits the amitpshere and tone the film is going for. The music is enjoyable and tense, and its pacing can be a bit slow at times, but does allow for an interesting point of view. Its main problem lies solely in its script, which revolves largely around a smut film production- but takes too many elements and formulaic tendencies from other horror films like Evil Dead, Friday the 13th, The Visit and most obviously Texas Chainsaw Massacre to really stand out on its own and become its own thing. In the end, its not a bad watch, I wouldn't watch it again, but I certainly didn't mind watching it. It isn't the most memorable, but I certainly don't have any disdain for it. It just could have been more, especially given the talent involved, but ironically it settled for less.My Rating: 5.8/10."
"X","fpcholcomb","29 November 2023",210,"I love the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I love it for its idiosyncrasies, its low budget ingenuity, its colorful villains, its charming flaws. That being said, I would not describe the Texas Chainsaw Massacre as high art. It is effectively schlock, good schlock, but schlock none the less. Schlock works when it is fun and creative, when it engages the viewer in its excesses. Schlock can, however, be elevated by a dedicated artist's vision, and that is what X attempts to do. It takes an established style and plot structure from B-movie horror of the past, now nostalgic in its appeal, and attempts to do three things, pay homage to those classics, elevate the material through artistic directing techniques not contemplated by the older films, and to talk about societies relationship to sex, youth, and religion in broad strokes. On all three accounts X is a failure.The film is not wholly without charm. Mia Goth is fantastic as the lead and the rest of the performances are solid. There are some beautiful shots, and the director has the courage to take some real chances with how he presents the intentionally textbook material. That is where my praise ends.The heart of the film is disappointing. Beautiful shots are ruined by the films tedious attempts to foreshadow its overbearing message. A perfect example is when Mia Goth's character, alone, goes for a swim in some stagnant water that is serene, yet ominous. Up to this point the film has been cultivating a relatively tense atmosphere through uncomfortable interactions with an elderly couple who owns the property where the rest of the characters are trying to surreptitiously film a porno. The scene didn't need blatant danger to feel creepy, but it instead elects to add a crocodile slowly following the main character bluntly foreshadowing danger in an incredibly cheap and contrived way. She is prey, and yet any audience member already knows that. They know X is a horror film. They know the old couple is evil because they are put in so much makeup and prosthetics that they hardly look human. The film is not clever when it moves slowly and blatantly shouts what it is attempting to do.Combined with the otherwise banal plot it's telegraphed unfolding, X also has much to say about sex, religion, and personhood, but it is so shallow in its interpretations of these concepts. In trying to be deep in comes across as shallow.Spoiler ahead, but the elderly woman's bloodlust is essentially fueled by her inability to feel desirable since she has aged. Her husband can no longer play the part of her romantic lover as the way she needs. She longs for the youth that the other characters have, and all the sexual and personal freedom it gives. The gang, on the other hand, are young and cocky and seek to leverage their youth to gain wealth and fame. They are vain people who are pretending to have deeper connection than they actually have (one girl talks about faking her interest during scenes, while the head honcho talks about all women being the same, etc., the film is never subtle). Mia Goth's character, while the softest spoken, still harps about how she wants to be successful above all else, like she deserves the fame she believes appearing in pornography will bring.The commentary here completely lacks nuance. These people don't inspire sympathy, but they don't deserve their fate. The film seems to critique old conservative forms of sex, yet the main thrust of the film is that making a porno and youthful hubris gets many people killed. The main character leaves the carnage at the end, but rather than relief at a quick getaway (a la Texas Chainsaw Massacre) she feels like John Wayne esq hero leaving victorious, which made little sense. To make matters worse the kills are boring. I found the first murder unbearably artsy in a way that felt unearned, and the rest were total duds, with one possible exception. The film wants to make art of gruesome murders, but also kills a lot of people in very anticlimactic and visually unappealing ways (quick gunshots, underwater and unseen deaths).Maybe some people will be taken with the shot composition and retro feel combined with a modern shooting style, but in my opinion a film needs a lot more than vapid exploration of themes along with a nostalgic style to be interesting or entertaining.X's ultimate sin is it lacked the charm of the slashers of the past, and in trying to innovate within the genre completely missed the point of it."

"X","Horror_Flick_Fanatic","20 March 2022",510,"While I knew this film was presented as a slasher film going in, I had better expectations given it was an A24 Studios film. Despite some of the famous names in the cast, I wouldn't consider it good. Probably my least favorite from the A24 films. The film is made in the cinematography style of classic 1970s slasher films, but it holds back on the brutality with the females. I really wished A24 was above PC culture.True 70s slasher/horror films were very brutal with both genders but not this one except perhaps with the old woman/zomb-et at the end.I was hoping at least a slightly smarter screenplay given it is A24, but disappointingly no. Mia Goth was probably the only likable character in the film. But I feel the special effects people overdid the prosthetics with the old couple. They resemble zombie monsters far more than the elderly. They could have placed a real elderly couple in there instead. Yes, the film does have some gore and blood but its predominately a very tame film. The worst of it all is a disembowel cow hit by a truck on the highway. It's not even part of the main story and we also see the aftermath of the accident.I don't feel the film deserves to be elevated because of the technical production. Authentic 1970s low budget B films were not technically sophisticated in camera work and lighting. The fancy lighting and best cinematographers of the time were reserved for mainstream big studio films and not low budget horror. With today's pre-fab software plugins templates for adobe software, copying the style wasn't an Einstein endeavor. Had this film been made by any other no name production studio, it would have been relegated into another Netflix Original category and not given accolades. The recent Netflix Texas Chainsaw original from 2022 is just as good a film as this one minus the famous actors."

That's it. That's the whole friggin movie!!!!! I just wasted 1 and half hours of my life jezzuzzz!!!!! Shame on a24 !!!"
"X","cadillac20","18 March 2022",810,"Paying homage to the slashers of yesteryear is nothing new, but Ti West's new movie X makes it feel fresh. He does this by primarily bringing attention to the sex parts of the genre and exploring what sex means. This is, after all, in part about a crew of people attempting to make a porno. But the sex angle goes beyond just cheap titillation. It is at the heart of the film, and West seems to be most interested in what the experience means, whether it's for love, a way to recapture youth, or getting the most out of life while one is still capable of experiencing the act.Beyond all this, though, is a fun, classically styled slasher that is equal parts titillation and slasher mayhem. Some may find the amount of nudity and sex, and heck the subject matter itself, distasteful, but for slasher fans, this will remind you of much of the early years of the genre. A lot has been made about how this is so heavily inspired by Texas Chainsaw Massacre and it's easy to see why. The majority of the film revolves around the singular location, an old farm seemingly in the middle of nowhere, Texas, ripe for plenty of slasher fun. Ti doesn't skimp on the red stuff either. While nothing gets too outlandishly creative, we do get some brutal kills with often gory results.It helps that characters are written well and likable. Despite the sleazy material they're attempting to create, they don't feel shallow or sleazy themselves. They believe in their work and the reasons for making it. While it may have been nice to get a little more depth out of them, they clearly have history and there are things hinted at that never get much development, they're at least a decent crowd of folks who are fun to be around. As for the villains, they're not quite as out there or mysterious as the trailer would lead you to believe. In fact, they're pretty grounded, but never the less creepy and tension is maintained consistently once the violence starts.If you know what the film's about, you have a pretty good idea of what to expect. It does take some unusual turns, but for me that only added to just how much the film stood on it's own. It certainly feels like a fresh entry into the slasher genre, something the genre needs. Ti West continues to make a name for himself as someone to watch out for. Have fun with this sexy, bloody good time."
"X","HorrorEnjoyer","26 May 2022",110,"After reading the plot, I expected to see a generic slasher movie, however, what I got was a boring artsy-wannabe flick, which takes itself way too seriously and ends up being devoid of soul or any kind of entertainment.After 1 HOUR of extremely slow and tedious build-up you get presented by the most pathetic horror movie villains I have seen in my entire life. Scree-writer must have a serious phobia of frail old people, because that's the only way you'll find any kind of thrills in this movie.With a pretentious façade, one might think that such a movie would at least be devoid of clichés, but they are all there - loud sound jump scares, extremely dumb victims, completely unrealistic kills, which you see coming a mile away, and one of the most pathetic endings to the slasher movie ever.Just go rewatch Texas Chainsaw Massacre - both originals and remakes are a million times more entertaining than this boring mess."
"X","Top_Dawg_Critic","23 January 2023",910,"They don't make em like this anymore. Good old-school slasher-horror flicks from the 70's and 80's. Writer, producer, director and editor Ti West was stellar in every department in this exceptionally well put together film. The cinematography was top shelf - all genres considered, and his directing was just as great. Even the score and soundtrack was the best I've heard in a very long time. All casting and performances were excellent, especially the lovely Jenna Ortega, and Mia Goth in her dual roles as Maxine Minx and granny Pearl. Kid Cudi also had some good fun being cast as Jackson Hole. The gore, prosthetics and special effects were on point. There were even some surprisingly unexpected jump-scares where you wouldn't expect them - all due to simplistic yet creative filmmaking techniques. The writing had a nice flow to it with continuity and decent pacing, so the 105 min runtime passed by comfortably. There really isn't much to negatively critique in this little gem, except I wished for more narrative and sub-plots. It's a must-see if you're a fan of this genre, and a well deserved 9/10 from me."
"X","dan_da_man-60288","7 May 2023",110,"It's a trope that slashers have some aspect of sex in them, sure, but the entire first hour of this pos is just the result of a horny director who wanteed to make porn but also wants to pretend they're making a legit movie to their friends. So they filmed bad porn and then tacked 40 mins of slasher on the end.A solid hour of just ""look she STILL has her tits out"" and ""let's have another group discussion about the morals of dating a porn star,"" followed by a kill scene set to the most cliched song to ever be in a kill scene.I get that there's some stupid nonsensical lookalike story going on with a girl and the old woman, but every time she moves in tense moments and a big rubber mask is bending in unnatural ways it pulls you right out of the immersion.The pacing is all over the place. Some scenes just go on for way too long for basically no additional payoff. Like yes, the killer is obviously emotional, but I got that from the first 10 stabs, and the next 20 just had me waiting for it to be over. Some scenes are way too blunt, having a person wander into an area and get killed in about 1 min flat.There's very little imagination in the kill scenes, which may have flown in the decade it's set, but we've had decades of slashers and can expect a bit more these days than someone blatantly holding a knife behind their back stabbing someone. I really hope nobody lost any sleep trying to write that scene."
"X","westy_captain","2 October 2022",610,"Not really a jump scare sort of deal and like if you read the little description about the movie it has all the spoilers in it already.First point, I thought it was really funny when kid Cudi was standing in the door frame and you could only see his shadowSecondly For a movie about making a porno, there were adequate number boobs shown.And the prosthetics used to make the main actor look older we're great.

It's a solid hour before any horror kicks in but when it does it's VERY bloody, gruesome and pretty sick.

"X","gortx","31 March 2022",NA,"Ti West's movie really should have been called ""E"" for elevated. It sets itself up as a smart take on the slasher films of the 70s and early 80s. As a bonus, the film within a film has the filmmakers making an 'elevated' porn flick (as a bonus, actor Owen Campbell who plays the ""Director"" even looks a bit like Director Tobe Hooper).Quite consciously taking it's set up from Tobe Hooper's 1974 TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, X has a group of randy pornographers renting a farmhouse from an elderly couple in the middle of nowhere in Texas (actually New Zealand). Writer-Director West's main idea here is to set up a contrast between the XXX filmmakers and the bible thumping civilians of the area. It's not an uninteresting idea, which, of course, plays off the the puritanical cliche in the slasher films of yore where the most sexually active characters are the most likely to g et killed off. In addition to MASSACRE, West includes nods to FRIDAY THE 13TH, Hooper's EATEN ALIVE and a very specific one to HALLOWEEN. X is set about 5 years after MASSACRE so that it can include a brief exchange about how home video will change the porno industry (adult films were already available on VHS for about 3 years).The movie is very well directed, with savvy use of cross-cutting between the porn film in the making and the terrors that await the group. Mia Goth (in a dual role; actually a triple if you stay after the credits) and Brittany Snow are the two pornstars to be and each dive in with relish. Kid Cudi is the cocky stud, while Martin Henderson is solid as the confidant Producer. Jenna Ortega is the ""crew"" all by her lonesome (she manages to keep her clothes on - must have a better agent). Stephen Ure is the ornery old man who rents out his guest house.As good as the filmmaking is, X ends up feeling too studied. The pacing is lugubrious even if it picks up towards the very end. Once the massacre begins (if not by power tools) it still ends up being fairly typical of the films it's commenting on, regardless of how well executed and 'elevated' it thinks it is. It's also too drawn out to satisfy some gore-hounds and once the blood starts flowing, probably too gross for the internet scribes dreaming of doing extended online essays dissecting it for it's elevated intellect. There are a couple of twists, but they aren't sufficient enough to compensate for the predictability.In the end, it's not as clever as West thinks it is, and despite some good Directing chops and acting, it's simply too self-conscious to be much of a fun thrill ride."
"X","johannes2000-1","16 March 2022",810,"I liked it. It's a nice old-fashioned (flawlessly 70's styled) slasher horror-flick, with a fairly original premise. As in any comparable horror movie the motives for the killings are pretty farfetched, but who cares, when they are pictured so relentlessley gruesome, the gore here is definitely not for the tender-hearted. Another strong point is how the movie very gradually builds up the tension, this is a real slow burner, the apprehension of looming doom is palpable throughout the movie. This is helped by a strong direction, a very clever and inventive editing, and some great photography, see for instance the scene of one of the girls swimming in the lake, while... well, I won't give it away, but it's beautiful and hair-raisingly scary at the same time!Add to all this some very funny dialogues and goings-on at the start, and you're in for a well made, old-school horror flick, maybe not life-changing but absolutely entertaining for those who can apprciate this kind of movie (like me!)."

There was a semi-interesting idea here but the stated motivations of the ""nearby enemy"" (as they are identified in a spoiler-free way in the ""storyline"") are hard to believe.So, there are some very mild scenes of adult entertainment here, but the supposed ""horror"" element fails miserably. There's a scene in a barn which ends absurdly -- what might have been a (pleasantly) nasty moment is just a damp squib.While I appreciate that the victims are not meant to realise they are in danger, I really think the audience needs to feel their peril on their behalf. This just failed miserably in that respect because the motivations of the other characters were just so hard to believe."

"X","miles670","15 April 2022",710,"I didn't know what to expect going into this movie. Some reviews said it was porn with some horror, some said it was a slasher B movie.

The gore is well done, the acting is very good I think, and the overall slasher aspect is reasonable, though it could have been a little more creative.Saying all of that none of it is what I'll remember this movie for. What really struck me in this movie was the portrayal of age and how it affects people and their relationships, I actually felt really sad for some of the characters in this movie, and that isn't usually how I'd expect to feel watching a slasher. It really did feel like the writers, directors,. And actors were trying to remind us of something whilst also making a decent slasher. I think it's to value our youth, and our lives as much as we can. I don't want to say much more as I don't want to spoil the movie.

Despite some of the famous names in the cast, I wouldn't consider it good. Probably my least favorite from the A24 films. The film is made in the cinematography style of classic 1970s slasher films, but it holds back on the brutality with the females. I really wished A24 was above PC culture.True 70s slasher/horror films were very brutal with both genders but not this one except perhaps with the old woman/zomb-et at the end.I was hoping at least a slightly smarter screenplay given it is A24, but disappointingly no. Mia Goth was probably the only likable character in the film. But I feel the special effects people overdid the prosthetics with the old couple. They resemble zombie monsters far more than the elderly. They could have placed a real elderly couple in there instead. Yes, the film does have some gore and blood but its predominately a very tame film. The worst of it all is a disembowel cow hit by a truck on the highway. It's not even part of the main story and we also see the aftermath of the accident.I don't feel the film deserves to be elevated because of the technical production. Authentic 1970s low budget B films were not technically sophisticated in camera work and lighting. The fancy lighting and best cinematographers of the time were reserved for mainstream big studio films and not low budget horror.

"X","cadillac20","18 March 2022",810,"Paying homage to the slashers of yesteryear is nothing new, but Ti West's new movie X makes it feel fresh. He does this by primarily bringing attention to the sex parts of the genre and exploring what sex means. This is, after all, in part about a crew of people attempting to make a porno. But the sex angle goes beyond just cheap titillation. It is at the heart of the film, and West seems to be most interested in what the experience means, whether it's for love, a way to recapture youth, or getting the most out of life while one is still capable of experiencing the act.Beyond all this, though, is a fun, classically styled slasher that is equal parts titillation and slasher mayhem. Some may find the amount of nudity and sex, and heck the subject matter itself, distasteful, but for slasher fans, this will remind you of much of the early years of the genre. A lot has been made about how this is so heavily inspired by Texas Chainsaw Massacre and it's easy to see why. The majority of the film revolves around the singular location, an old farm seemingly in the middle of nowhere, Texas, ripe for plenty of slasher fun. Ti doesn't skimp on the red stuff either. While nothing gets too outlandishly creative, we do get some brutal kills with often gory results.It helps that characters are written well and likable. Despite the sleazy material they're attempting to create, they don't feel shallow or sleazy themselves. They believe in their work and the reasons for making it. While it may have been nice to get a little more depth out of them, they clearly have history and there are things hinted at that never get much development, they're at least a decent crowd of folks who are fun to be around. As for the villains, they're not quite as out there or mysterious as the trailer would lead you to believe. In fact, they're pretty grounded, but never the less creepy and tension is maintained consistently once the violence starts.If you know what the film's about, you have a pretty good idea of what to expect. It does take some unusual turns, but for me that only added to just how much the film stood on it's own. It certainly feels like a fresh entry into the slasher genre, something the genre needs. Ti West continues to make a name for himself as someone to watch out for. Have fun with this sexy, bloody good time."

Writer, producer, director and editor Ti West was stellar in every department in this exceptionally well put together film. The cinematography was top shelf - all genres considered, and his directing was just as great. Even the score and soundtrack was the best I've heard in a very long time. All casting and performances were excellent, especially the lovely Jenna Ortega, and Mia Goth in her dual roles as Maxine Minx and granny Pearl. Kid Cudi also had some good fun being cast as Jackson Hole. The gore, prosthetics and special effects were on point. There were even some surprisingly unexpected jump-scares where you wouldn't expect them - all due to simplistic yet creative filmmaking techniques. The writing had a nice flow to it with continuity and decent pacing, so the 105 min runtime passed by comfortably. There really isn't much to negatively critique in this little gem, except I wished for more narrative and sub-plots. It's a must-see if you're a fan of this genre, and a well deserved 9/10 from me."
"X","dan_da_man-60288","7 May 2023",110,"It's a trope that slashers have some aspect of sex in them, sure, but the entire first hour of this pos is just the result of a horny director who wanteed to make porn but also wants to pretend they're making a legit movie to their friends. So they filmed bad porn and then tacked 40 mins of slasher on the end.A solid hour of just ""look she STILL has her tits out"" and ""let's have another group discussion about the morals of dating a porn star,"" followed by a kill scene set to the most cliched song to ever be in a kill scene.I get that there's some stupid nonsensical lookalike story going on with a girl and the old woman, but every time she moves in tense moments and a big rubber mask is bending in unnatural ways it pulls you right out of the immersion.The pacing is all over the place. Some scenes just go on for way too long for basically no additional payoff. Like yes, the killer is obviously emotional, but I got that from the first 10 stabs, and the next 20 just had me waiting for it to be over. Some scenes are way too blunt, having a person wander into an area and get killed in about 1 min flat.There's very little imagination in the kill scenes, which may have flown in the decade it's set, but we've had decades of slashers and can expect a bit more these days than someone blatantly holding a knife behind their back stabbing someone. I really hope nobody lost any sleep trying to write that scene."

It's a solid hour before any horror kicks in but when it does it's VERY bloody, gruesome and pretty sick.

"X","gortx","31 March 2022",NA,"Ti West's movie really should have been called ""E"" for elevated. It sets itself up as a smart take on the slasher films of the 70s and early 80s. As a bonus, the film within a film has the filmmakers making an 'elevated' porn flick (as a bonus, actor Owen Campbell who plays the ""Director"" even looks a bit like Director Tobe Hooper).Quite consciously taking it's set up from Tobe Hooper's 1974 TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, X has a group of randy pornographers renting a farmhouse from an elderly couple in the middle of nowhere in Texas (actually New Zealand). Writer-Director West's main idea here is to set up a contrast between the XXX filmmakers and the bible thumping civilians of the area. It's not an uninteresting idea, which, of course, plays off the the puritanical cliche in the slasher films of yore where the most sexually active characters are the most likely to g et killed off. In addition to MASSACRE, West includes nods to FRIDAY THE 13TH, Hooper's EATEN ALIVE and a very specific one to HALLOWEEN. X is set about 5 years after MASSACRE so that it can include a brief exchange about how home video will change the porno industry (adult films were already available on VHS for about 3 years).The movie is very well directed, with savvy use of cross-cutting between the porn film in the making and the terrors that await the group. Mia Goth (in a dual role; actually a triple if you stay after the credits) and Brittany Snow are the two pornstars to be and each dive in with relish. Kid Cudi is the cocky stud, while Martin Henderson is solid as the confidant Producer. Jenna Ortega is the ""crew"" all by her lonesome (she manages to keep her clothes on - must have a better agent). Stephen Ure is the ornery old man who rents out his guest house.As good as the filmmaking is, X ends up feeling too studied. The pacing is lugubrious even if it picks up towards the very end. Once the massacre begins (if not by power tools) it still ends up being fairly typical of the films it's commenting on, regardless of how well executed and 'elevated' it thinks it is. It's also too drawn out to satisfy some gore-hounds and once the blood starts flowing, probably too gross for the internet scribes dreaming of doing extended online essays dissecting it for it's elevated intellect. There are a couple of twists, but they aren't sufficient enough to compensate for the predictability.In the end, it's not as clever as West thinks it is, and despite some good Directing chops and acting, it's simply too self-conscious to be much of a fun thrill ride."
"X","johannes2000-1","16 March 2022",810,"I liked it. It's a nice old-fashioned (flawlessly 70's styled) slasher horror-flick, with a fairly original premise. As in any comparable horror movie the motives for the killings are pretty farfetched, but who cares, when they are pictured so relentlessley gruesome, the gore here is definitely not for the tender-hearted. Another strong point is how the movie very gradually builds up the tension, this is a real slow burner, the apprehension of looming doom is palpable throughout the movie. This is helped by a strong direction, a very clever and inventive editing, and some great photography, see for instance the scene of one of the girls swimming in the lake, while... well, I won't give it away, but it's beautiful and hair-raisingly scary at the same time!Add to all this some very funny dialogues and goings-on at the start, and you're in for a well made, old-school horror flick, maybe not life-changing but absolutely entertaining for those who can apprciate this kind of movie (like me!)."

Highly not recommended !"
"X","frukuk","6 January 2024",210,"One star each for casting Mia Goth and Brittany Snow, but zero stars for the underdeveloped screenplay and the rest of it. There was a semi-interesting idea here but the stated motivations of the ""nearby enemy"" (as they are identified in a spoiler-free way in the ""storyline"") are hard to believe.So, there are some very mild scenes of adult entertainment here, but the supposed ""horror"" element fails miserably. There's a scene in a barn which ends absurdly -- what might have been a (pleasantly) nasty moment is just a damp squib.While I appreciate that the victims are not meant to realise they are in danger, I really think the audience needs to feel their peril on their behalf. This just failed miserably in that respect because the motivations of the other characters were just so hard to believe."

"X","miles670","15 April 2022",710,"I didn't know what to expect going into this movie. Some reviews said it was porn with some horror, some said it was a slasher B movie. Some said decent acting and a good gore fest.It was all of the above, though I'd say less porn, there are some nude/sex scenes but they're really not the heart of the movie. The gore is well done, the acting is very good I think, and the overall slasher aspect is reasonable, though it could have been a little more creative.Saying all of that none of it is what I'll remember this movie for. What really struck me in this movie was the portrayal of age and how it affects people and their relationships, I actually felt really sad for some of the characters in this movie, and that isn't usually how I'd expect to feel watching a slasher. It really did feel like the writers, directors,. And actors were trying to remind us of something whilst also making a decent slasher. I think it's to value our youth, and our lives as much as we can. I don't want to say much more as I don't want to spoil the movie. Needless to say if you're looking for a decent movie to check out I'd recommend giving this a go. It will entertain you and also make you think a little about the problems others have."
"X","aidanratesmovies","2 April 2022",610,"An interesting slow burn, but without enough to make it stand against the countless other slasher films, X is a fine film and another tribute to the iconic genre that made horror so popular in the first place. Granted, I do enjoy myself a slasher film from time to time- I'm quite fond of films like Nightmare on Elm Street and My Bloody Valentine, but where X faults among the others is through using a rather familiar formula without any true unique purpose. Throughout the film the characters often talk about an X factor, something that makes Mia Goth's character special and starworthy- but unlike its mentionings- this film just doesn't have that. The acting is really good, I love the underrated Mia Goth as always- as well as Brittany Snow, Martin Henderson, and even Kid Cudi did a rather impressive job. The cinematography is fantastic and perfectly fits the amitpshere and tone the film is going for. The music is enjoyable and tense, and its pacing can be a bit slow at times, but does allow for an interesting point of view. Its main problem lies solely in its script, which revolves largely around a smut film production- but takes too many elements and formulaic tendencies from other horror films like Evil Dead, Friday the 13th, The Visit and most obviously Texas Chainsaw Massacre to really stand out on its own and become its own thing. In the end, its not a bad watch, I wouldn't watch it again, but I certainly didn't mind watching it. It isn't the most memorable, but I certainly don't have any disdain for it. It just could have been more, especially given the talent involved, but ironically it settled for less.My Rating: 5.8/10."
"X","fpcholcomb","29 November 2023",210,"I love the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I love it for its idiosyncrasies, its low budget ingenuity, its colorful villains, its charming flaws. That being said, I would not describe the Texas Chainsaw Massacre as high art. It is effectively schlock, good schlock, but schlock none the less. Schlock works when it is fun and creative, when it engages the viewer in its excesses. Schlock can, however, be elevated by a dedicated artist's vision, and that is what X attempts to do. It takes an established style and plot structure from B-movie horror of the past, now nostalgic in its appeal, and attempts to do three things, pay homage to those classics, elevate the material through artistic directing techniques not contemplated by the older films, and to talk about societies relationship to sex, youth, and religion in broad strokes. On all three accounts X is a failure.The film is not wholly without charm. Mia Goth is fantastic as the lead and the rest of the performances are solid. There are some beautiful shots, and the director has the courage to take some real chances with how he presents the intentionally textbook material. That is where my praise ends.The heart of the film is disappointing. Beautiful shots are ruined by the films tedious attempts to foreshadow its overbearing message. A perfect example is when Mia Goth's character, alone, goes for a swim in some stagnant water that is serene, yet ominous. Up to this point the film has been cultivating a relatively tense atmosphere through uncomfortable interactions with an elderly couple who owns the property where the rest of the characters are trying to surreptitiously film a porno. The scene didn't need blatant danger to feel creepy, but it instead elects to add a crocodile slowly following the main character bluntly foreshadowing danger in an incredibly cheap and contrived way. She is prey, and yet any audience member already knows that. They know X is a horror film. They know the old couple is evil because they are put in so much makeup and prosthetics that they hardly look human. The film is not clever when it moves slowly and blatantly shouts what it is attempting to do.Combined with the otherwise banal plot it's telegraphed unfolding, X also has much to say about sex, religion, and personhood, but it is so shallow in its interpretations of these concepts. In trying to be deep in comes across as shallow.Spoiler ahead, but the elderly woman's bloodlust is essentially fueled by her inability to feel desirable since she has aged. Her husband can no longer play the part of her romantic lover as the way she needs. She longs for the youth that the other characters have, and all the sexual and personal freedom it gives. The gang, on the other hand, are young and cocky and seek to leverage their youth to gain wealth and fame. They are vain people who are pretending to have deeper connection than they actually have (one girl talks about faking her interest during scenes, while the head honcho talks about all women being the same, etc., the film is never subtle). Mia Goth's character, while the softest spoken, still harps about how she wants to be successful above all else, like she deserves the fame she believes appearing in pornography will bring.The commentary here completely lacks nuance. These people don't inspire sympathy, but they don't deserve their fate. The film seems to critique old conservative forms of sex, yet the main thrust of the film is that making a porno and youthful hubris gets many people killed. The main character leaves the carnage at the end, but rather than relief at a quick getaway (a la Texas Chainsaw Massacre) she feels like John Wayne esq hero leaving victorious, which made little sense. To make matters worse the kills are boring. I found the first murder unbearably artsy in a way that felt unearned, and the rest were total duds, with one possible exception. The film wants to make art of gruesome murders, but also kills a lot of people in very anticlimactic and visually unappealing ways (quick gunshots, underwater and unseen deaths).Maybe some people will be taken with the shot composition and retro feel combined with a modern shooting style, but in my opinion a film needs a lot more than vapid exploration of themes along with a nostalgic style to be interesting or entertaining.X's ultimate sin is it lacked the charm of the slashers of the past, and in trying to innovate within the genre completely missed the point of it."
"X","Leofwine_draca","2 November 2022",310,"X (2022) is a recent horror from Ti West that feels like a homage to THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE complete with '70s trappings and grindhouse feel.

All goes well until nightfall, when murderous intentions arise and things soon turn into a night of terror. I hadn't liked West's CABIN FEVER 2 or HOUSE OF THE DEVIL and didn't expect to like this either, and - surprise! - I hated it.It's not a slow burner (for a change) but it is void of horror content, or any interesting content at all really.

All casting and performances were excellent, especially the lovely Jenna Ortega, and Mia Goth in her dual roles as Maxine Minx and granny Pearl. Kid Cudi also had some good fun being cast as Jackson Hole. The gore, prosthetics and special effects were on point. There were even some surprisingly unexpected jump-scares where you wouldn't expect them - all due to simplistic yet creative filmmaking techniques. The writing had a nice flow to it with continuity and decent pacing, so the 105 min runtime passed by comfortably. There really isn't much to negatively critique in this little gem, except I wished for more narrative and sub-plots. It's a must-see if you're a fan of this genre, and a well deserved 9/10 from me."

"X","gortx","31 March 2022",NA,"Ti West's movie really should have been called ""E"" for elevated. It sets itself up as a smart take on the slasher films of the 70s and early 80s. As a bonus, the film within a film has the filmmakers making an 'elevated' porn flick (as a bonus, actor Owen Campbell who plays the ""Director"" even looks a bit like Director Tobe Hooper).Quite consciously taking it's set up from Tobe Hooper's 1974 TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, X has a group of randy pornographers renting a farmhouse from an elderly couple in the middle of nowhere in Texas (actually New Zealand). Writer-Director West's main idea here is to set up a contrast between the XXX filmmakers and the bible thumping civilians of the area. It's not an uninteresting idea, which, of course, plays off the the puritanical cliche in the slasher films of yore where the most sexually active characters are the most likely to g et killed off. In addition to MASSACRE, West includes nods to FRIDAY THE 13TH, Hooper's EATEN ALIVE and a very specific one to HALLOWEEN. X is set about 5 years after MASSACRE so that it can include a brief exchange about how home video will change the porno industry (adult films were already available on VHS for about 3 years).The movie is very well directed, with savvy use of cross-cutting between the porn film in the making and the terrors that await the group. Mia Goth (in a dual role; actually a triple if you stay after the credits) and Brittany Snow are the two pornstars to be and each dive in with relish. Kid Cudi is the cocky stud, while Martin Henderson is solid as the confidant Producer. Jenna Ortega is the ""crew"" all by her lonesome (she manages to keep her clothes on - must have a better agent). Stephen Ure is the ornery old man who rents out his guest house.As good as the filmmaking is, X ends up feeling too studied. The pacing is lugubrious even if it picks up towards the very end. Once the massacre begins (if not by power tools) it still ends up being fairly typical of the films it's commenting on, regardless of how well executed and 'elevated' it thinks it is. It's also too drawn out to satisfy some gore-hounds and once the blood starts flowing, probably too gross for the internet scribes dreaming of doing extended online essays dissecting it for it's elevated intellect. There are a couple of twists, but they aren't sufficient enough to compensate for the predictability.In the end, it's not as clever as West thinks it is, and despite some good Directing chops and acting, it's simply too self-conscious to be much of a fun thrill ride."
"X","johannes2000-1","16 March 2022",810,"I liked it. It's a nice old-fashioned (flawlessly 70's styled) slasher horror-flick, with a fairly original premise. As in any comparable horror movie the motives for the killings are pretty farfetched, but who cares, when they are pictured so relentlessley gruesome, the gore here is definitely not for the tender-hearted. Another strong point is how the movie very gradually builds up the tension, this is a real slow burner, the apprehension of looming doom is palpable throughout the movie. This is helped by a strong direction, a very clever and inventive editing, and some great photography, see for instance the scene of one of the girls swimming in the lake, while... well, I won't give it away, but it's beautiful and hair-raisingly scary at the same time!Add to all this some very funny dialogues and goings-on at the start, and you're in for a well made, old-school horror flick, maybe not life-changing but absolutely entertaining for those who can apprciate this kind of movie (like me!)."
"X","tchitouniaram","16 April 2022",310,"My expectations were quite high for this film ... After watching it , I just don't understand what's all the hype is about ? To call it mediocre is to make a compliment ! Slow , predictable , not very clever horror , which is not even a horror , just an unrealistic portrayal of mayhem based on sex... Highly not recommended !"
"X","frukuk","6 January 2024",210,"One star each for casting Mia Goth and Brittany Snow, but zero stars for the underdeveloped screenplay and the rest of it. There was a semi-interesting idea here but the stated motivations of the ""nearby enemy"" (as they are identified in a spoiler-free way in the ""storyline"") are hard to believe.So, there are some very mild scenes of adult entertainment here, but the supposed ""horror"" element fails miserably. There's a scene in a barn which ends absurdly -- what might have been a (pleasantly) nasty moment is just a damp squib.While I appreciate that the victims are not meant to realise they are in danger, I really think the audience needs to feel their peril on their behalf. This just failed miserably in that respect because the motivations of the other characters were just so hard to believe."
"X","JoBloTheMovieCritic","19 March 2022",510,"5/10 - while it was nice to see Brittany Snow on the big screen again after the Pitch Perfect movies and it continued Jenna Ortega's Hollywood takeover, this utterly bizarre, inconsistent, and incomplete attempt at a ""sexy slasher"" starts off strong but a few moments aside, becomes utterly laughable in the last 45 minutes."
"X","miles670","15 April 2022",710,"I didn't know what to expect going into this movie. Some reviews said it was porn with some horror, some said it was a slasher B movie. Some said decent acting and a good gore fest.It was all of the above, though I'd say less porn, there are some nude/sex scenes but they're really not the heart of the movie. The gore is well done, the acting is very good I think, and the overall slasher aspect is reasonable, though it could have been a little more creative.Saying all of that none of it is what I'll remember this movie for. What really struck me in this movie was the portrayal of age and how it affects people and their relationships, I actually felt really sad for some of the characters in this movie, and that isn't usually how I'd expect to feel watching a slasher. It really did feel like the writers, directors,. And actors were trying to remind us of something whilst also making a decent slasher. I think it's to value our youth, and our lives as much as we can. I don't want to say much more as I don't want to spoil the movie. Needless to say if you're looking for a decent movie to check out I'd recommend giving this a go. It will entertain you and also make you think a little about the problems others have."
"X","aidanratesmovies","2 April 2022",610,"An interesting slow burn, but without enough to make it stand against the countless other slasher films, X is a fine film and another tribute to the iconic genre that made horror so popular in the first place. Granted, I do enjoy myself a slasher film from time to time- I'm quite fond of films like Nightmare on Elm Street and My Bloody Valentine, but where X faults among the others is through using a rather familiar formula without any true unique purpose. Throughout the film the characters often talk about an X factor, something that makes Mia Goth's character special and starworthy- but unlike its mentionings- this film just doesn't have that. The acting is really good, I love the underrated Mia Goth as always- as well as Brittany Snow, Martin Henderson, and even Kid Cudi did a rather impressive job. The cinematography is fantastic and perfectly fits the amitpshere and tone the film is going for. The music is enjoyable and tense, and its pacing can be a bit slow at times, but does allow for an interesting point of view. Its main problem lies solely in its script, which revolves largely around a smut film production- but takes too many elements and formulaic tendencies from other horror films like Evil Dead, Friday the 13th, The Visit and most obviously Texas Chainsaw Massacre to really stand out on its own and become its own thing. In the end, its not a bad watch, I wouldn't watch it again, but I certainly didn't mind watching it. It isn't the most memorable, but I certainly don't have any disdain for it. It just could have been more, especially given the talent involved, but ironically it settled for less.My Rating: 5.8/10."
"X","fpcholcomb","29 November 2023",210,"I love the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I love it for its idiosyncrasies, its low budget ingenuity, its colorful villains, its charming flaws. That being said, I would not describe the Texas Chainsaw Massacre as high art. It is effectively schlock, good schlock, but schlock none the less. Schlock works when it is fun and creative, when it engages the viewer in its excesses. Schlock can, however, be elevated by a dedicated artist's vision, and that is what X attempts to do. It takes an established style and plot structure from B-movie horror of the past, now nostalgic in its appeal, and attempts to do three things, pay homage to those classics, elevate the material through artistic directing techniques not contemplated by the older films, and to talk about societies relationship to sex, youth, and religion in broad strokes. On all three accounts X is a failure.The film is not wholly without charm. Mia Goth is fantastic as the lead and the rest of the performances are solid. There are some beautiful shots, and the director has the courage to take some real chances with how he presents the intentionally textbook material. That is where my praise ends.The heart of the film is disappointing. Beautiful shots are ruined by the films tedious attempts to foreshadow its overbearing message. A perfect example is when Mia Goth's character, alone, goes for a swim in some stagnant water that is serene, yet ominous. Up to this point the film has been cultivating a relatively tense atmosphere through uncomfortable interactions with an elderly couple who owns the property where the rest of the characters are trying to surreptitiously film a porno. The scene didn't need blatant danger to feel creepy, but it instead elects to add a crocodile slowly following the main character bluntly foreshadowing danger in an incredibly cheap and contrived way. She is prey, and yet any audience member already knows that. They know X is a horror film. They know the old couple is evil because they are put in so much makeup and prosthetics that they hardly look human. The film is not clever when it moves slowly and blatantly shouts what it is attempting to do.Combined with the otherwise banal plot it's telegraphed unfolding, X also has much to say about sex, religion, and personhood, but it is so shallow in its interpretations of these concepts. In trying to be deep in comes across as shallow.Spoiler ahead, but the elderly woman's bloodlust is essentially fueled by her inability to feel desirable since she has aged. Her husband can no longer play the part of her romantic lover as the way she needs. She longs for the youth that the other characters have, and all the sexual and personal freedom it gives. The gang, on the other hand, are young and cocky and seek to leverage their youth to gain wealth and fame. They are vain people who are pretending to have deeper connection than they actually have (one girl talks about faking her interest during scenes, while the head honcho talks about all women being the same, etc., the film is never subtle). Mia Goth's character, while the softest spoken, still harps about how she wants to be successful above all else, like she deserves the fame she believes appearing in pornography will bring.The commentary here completely lacks nuance. These people don't inspire sympathy, but they don't deserve their fate. The film seems to critique old conservative forms of sex, yet the main thrust of the film is that making a porno and youthful hubris gets many people killed. The main character leaves the carnage at the end, but rather than relief at a quick getaway (a la Texas Chainsaw Massacre) she feels like John Wayne esq hero leaving victorious, which made little sense. To make matters worse the kills are boring. I found the first murder unbearably artsy in a way that felt unearned, and the rest were total duds, with one possible exception. The film wants to make art of gruesome murders, but also kills a lot of people in very anticlimactic and visually unappealing ways (quick gunshots, underwater and unseen deaths).Maybe some people will be taken with the shot composition and retro feel combined with a modern shooting style, but in my opinion a film needs a lot more than vapid exploration of themes along with a nostalgic style to be interesting or entertaining.X's ultimate sin is it lacked the charm of the slashers of the past, and in trying to innovate within the genre completely missed the point of it."
"X","Leofwine_draca","2 November 2022",310,"X (2022) is a recent horror from Ti West that feels like a homage to THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE complete with '70s trappings and grindhouse feel. The story is about the actors and crew of a low budget porn shoot heading to a remote cabin owned by a couple of oldsters. All goes well until nightfall, when murderous intentions arise and things soon turn into a night of terror. I hadn't liked West's CABIN FEVER 2 or HOUSE OF THE DEVIL and didn't expect to like this either, and - surprise! - I hated it.It's not a slow burner (for a change) but it is void of horror content, or any interesting content at all really. For the first hour nothing happens apart from time-wasting with annoying characters, bad dialogue, and endless sex scenes that smack of padding. In the last 45 minutes it becomes a fairly gory but unconvincing slasher, with bad makeup and more cliches than you can shake a stick at. It's the film's senselessness that really got to me, like the female crew member who suddenly decides she wants to star in the shoot. Yeah, okay, that would happen."
"X","Horror_Flick_Fanatic","20 March 2022",510,"While I knew this film was presented as a slasher film going in, I had better expectations given it was an A24 Studios film. Despite some of the famous names in the cast, I wouldn't consider it good. Probably my least favorite from the A24 films. The film is made in the cinematography style of classic 1970s slasher films, but it holds back on the brutality with the females. I really wished A24 was above PC culture.True 70s slasher/horror films were very brutal with both genders but not this one except perhaps with the old woman/zomb-et at the end.I was hoping at least a slightly smarter screenplay given it is A24, but disappointingly no. Mia Goth was probably the only likable character in the film. But I feel the special effects people overdid the prosthetics with the old couple. They resemble zombie monsters far more than the elderly. They could have placed a real elderly couple in there instead. Yes, the film does have some gore and blood but its predominately a very tame film. The worst of it all is a disembowel cow hit by a truck on the highway. It's not even part of the main story and we also see the aftermath of the accident.I don't feel the film deserves to be elevated because of the technical production. Authentic 1970s low budget B films were not technically sophisticated in camera work and lighting. The fancy lighting and best cinematographers of the time were reserved for mainstream big studio films and not low budget horror. With today's pre-fab software plugins templates for adobe software, copying the style wasn't an Einstein endeavor. Had this film been made by any other no name production studio, it would have been relegated into another Netflix Original category and not given accolades. The recent Netflix Texas Chainsaw original from 2022 is just as good a film as this one minus the famous actors."

"X","cadillac20","18 March 2022",810,"Paying homage to the slashers of yesteryear is nothing new, but Ti West's new movie X makes it feel fresh. He does this by primarily bringing attention to the sex parts of the genre and exploring what sex means. This is, after all, in part about a crew of people attempting to make a porno. But the sex angle goes beyond just cheap titillation. It is at the heart of the film, and West seems to be most interested in what the experience means, whether it's for love, a way to recapture youth, or getting the most out of life while one is still capable of experiencing the act.Beyond all this, though, is a fun, classically styled slasher that is equal parts titillation and slasher mayhem. Some may find the amount of nudity and sex, and heck the subject matter itself, distasteful, but for slasher fans, this will remind you of much of the early years of the genre. A lot has been made about how this is so heavily inspired by Texas Chainsaw Massacre and it's easy to see why. The majority of the film revolves around the singular location, an old farm seemingly in the middle of nowhere, Texas, ripe for plenty of slasher fun. Ti doesn't skimp on the red stuff either. While nothing gets too outlandishly creative, we do get some brutal kills with often gory results.It helps that characters are written well and likable. Despite the sleazy material they're attempting to create, they don't feel shallow or sleazy themselves. They believe in their work and the reasons for making it. While it may have been nice to get a little more depth out of them, they clearly have history and there are things hinted at that never get much development, they're at least a decent crowd of folks who are fun to be around. As for the villains, they're not quite as out there or mysterious as the trailer would lead you to believe. In fact, they're pretty grounded, but never the less creepy and tension is maintained consistently once the violence starts.If you know what the film's about, you have a pretty good idea of what to expect. It does take some unusual turns, but for me that only added to just how much the film stood on it's own. It certainly feels like a fresh entry into the slasher genre, something the genre needs. Ti West continues to make a name for himself as someone to watch out for. Have fun with this sexy, bloody good time."
"X","HorrorEnjoyer","26 May 2022",110,"After reading the plot, I expected to see a generic slasher movie, however, what I got was a boring artsy-wannabe flick, which takes itself way too seriously and ends up being devoid of soul or any kind of entertainment.After 1 HOUR of extremely slow and tedious build-up you get presented by the most pathetic horror movie villains I have seen in my entire life. Scree-writer must have a serious phobia of frail old people, because that's the only way you'll find any kind of thrills in this movie.With a pretentious façade, one might think that such a movie would at least be devoid of clichés, but they are all there - loud sound jump scares, extremely dumb victims, completely unrealistic kills, which you see coming a mile away, and one of the most pathetic endings to the slasher movie ever.Just go rewatch Texas Chainsaw Massacre - both originals and remakes are a million times more entertaining than this boring mess."

"X","gortx","31 March 2022",NA,"Ti West's movie really should have been called ""E"" for elevated. It sets itself up as a smart take on the slasher films of the 70s and early 80s. As a bonus, the film within a film has the filmmakers making an 'elevated' porn flick (as a bonus, actor Owen Campbell who plays the ""Director"" even looks a bit like Director Tobe Hooper).Quite consciously taking it's set up from Tobe Hooper's 1974 TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, X has a group of randy pornographers renting a farmhouse from an elderly couple in the middle of nowhere in Texas (actually New Zealand). Writer-Director West's main idea here is to set up a contrast between the XXX filmmakers and the bible thumping civilians of the area. It's not an uninteresting idea, which, of course, plays off the the puritanical cliche in the slasher films of yore where the most sexually active characters are the most likely to g et killed off. In addition to MASSACRE, West includes nods to FRIDAY THE 13TH, Hooper's EATEN ALIVE and a very specific one to HALLOWEEN. X is set about 5 years after MASSACRE so that it can include a brief exchange about how home video will change the porno industry (adult films were already available on VHS for about 3 years).The movie is very well directed, with savvy use of cross-cutting between the porn film in the making and the terrors that await the group. Mia Goth (in a dual role; actually a triple if you stay after the credits) and Brittany Snow are the two pornstars to be and each dive in with relish. Kid Cudi is the cocky stud, while Martin Henderson is solid as the confidant Producer. Jenna Ortega is the ""crew"" all by her lonesome (she manages to keep her clothes on - must have a better agent). Stephen Ure is the ornery old man who rents out his guest house.As good as the filmmaking is, X ends up feeling too studied. The pacing is lugubrious even if it picks up towards the very end. Once the massacre begins (if not by power tools) it still ends up being fairly typical of the films it's commenting on, regardless of how well executed and 'elevated' it thinks it is. It's also too drawn out to satisfy some gore-hounds and once the blood starts flowing, probably too gross for the internet scribes dreaming of doing extended online essays dissecting it for it's elevated intellect.

"X","johannes2000-1","16 March 2022",810,"I liked it. It's a nice old-fashioned (flawlessly 70's styled) slasher horror-flick, with a fairly original premise. As in any comparable horror movie the motives for the killings are pretty farfetched, but who cares, when they are pictured so relentlessley gruesome, the gore here is definitely not for the tender-hearted. Another strong point is how the movie very gradually builds up the tension, this is a real slow burner, the apprehension of looming doom is palpable throughout the movie. This is helped by a strong direction, a very clever and inventive editing, and some great photography, see for instance the scene of one of the girls swimming in the lake, while... well, I won't give it away, but it's beautiful and hair-raisingly scary at the same time!Add to all this some very funny dialogues and goings-on at the start, and you're in for a well made, old-school horror flick, maybe not life-changing but absolutely entertaining for those who can apprciate this kind of movie (like me!)."

"X","aidanratesmovies","2 April 2022",610,"An interesting slow burn, but without enough to make it stand against the countless other slasher films, X is a fine film and another tribute to the iconic genre that made horror so popular in the first place. Granted, I do enjoy myself a slasher film from time to time- I'm quite fond of films like Nightmare on Elm Street and My Bloody Valentine, but where X faults among the others is through using a rather familiar formula without any true unique purpose. Throughout the film the characters often talk about an X factor, something that makes Mia Goth's character special and starworthy- but unlike its mentionings- this film just doesn't have that. The acting is really good, I love the underrated Mia Goth as always- as well as Brittany Snow, Martin Henderson, and even Kid Cudi did a rather impressive job. The cinematography is fantastic and perfectly fits the amitpshere and tone the film is going for. The music is enjoyable and tense, and its pacing can be a bit slow at times, but does allow for an interesting point of view. Its main problem lies solely in its script, which revolves largely around a smut film production- but takes too many elements and formulaic tendencies from other horror films like Evil Dead, Friday the 13th, The Visit and most obviously Texas Chainsaw Massacre to really stand out on its own and become its own thing. In the end, its not a bad watch, I wouldn't watch it again, but I certainly didn't mind watching it. It isn't the most memorable, but I certainly don't have any disdain for it. It just could have been more, especially given the talent involved, but ironically it settled for less.My Rating: 5.8/10."
"X","fpcholcomb","29 November 2023",210,"I love the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I love it for its idiosyncrasies, its low budget ingenuity, its colorful villains, its charming flaws. That being said, I would not describe the Texas Chainsaw Massacre as high art. It is effectively schlock, good schlock, but schlock none the less. Schlock works when it is fun and creative, when it engages the viewer in its excesses. Schlock can, however, be elevated by a dedicated artist's vision, and that is what X attempts to do. It takes an established style and plot structure from B-movie horror of the past, now nostalgic in its appeal, and attempts to do three things, pay homage to those classics, elevate the material through artistic directing techniques not contemplated by the older films, and to talk about societies relationship to sex, youth, and religion in broad strokes. On all three accounts X is a failure.The film is not wholly without charm. Mia Goth is fantastic as the lead and the rest of the performances are solid. There are some beautiful shots, and the director has the courage to take some real chances with how he presents the intentionally textbook material. That is where my praise ends.The heart of the film is disappointing. Beautiful shots are ruined by the films tedious attempts to foreshadow its overbearing message. A perfect example is when Mia Goth's character, alone, goes for a swim in some stagnant water that is serene, yet ominous. Up to this point the film has been cultivating a relatively tense atmosphere through uncomfortable interactions with an elderly couple who owns the property where the rest of the characters are trying to surreptitiously film a porno. The scene didn't need blatant danger to feel creepy, but it instead elects to add a crocodile slowly following the main character bluntly foreshadowing danger in an incredibly cheap and contrived way. She is prey, and yet any audience member already knows that. They know X is a horror film. They know the old couple is evil because they are put in so much makeup and prosthetics that they hardly look human. The film is not clever when it moves slowly and blatantly shouts what it is attempting to do.Combined with the otherwise banal plot it's telegraphed unfolding, X also has much to say about sex, religion, and personhood, but it is so shallow in its interpretations of these concepts. In trying to be deep in comes across as shallow.Spoiler ahead, but the elderly woman's bloodlust is essentially fueled by her inability to feel desirable since she has aged. Her husband can no longer play the part of her romantic lover as the way she needs. She longs for the youth that the other characters have, and all the sexual and personal freedom it gives. The gang, on the other hand, are young and cocky and seek to leverage their youth to gain wealth and fame. They are vain people who are pretending to have deeper connection than they actually have (one girl talks about faking her interest during scenes, while the head honcho talks about all women being the same, etc., the film is never subtle). Mia Goth's character, while the softest spoken, still harps about how she wants to be successful above all else, like she deserves the fame she believes appearing in pornography will bring.The commentary here completely lacks nuance. These people don't inspire sympathy, but they don't deserve their fate. The film seems to critique old conservative forms of sex, yet the main thrust of the film is that making a porno and youthful hubris gets many people killed. The main character leaves the carnage at the end, but rather than relief at a quick getaway (a la Texas Chainsaw Massacre) she feels like John Wayne esq hero leaving victorious, which made little sense. To make matters worse the kills are boring. I found the first murder unbearably artsy in a way that felt unearned, and the rest were total duds, with one possible exception. The film wants to make art of gruesome murders, but also kills a lot of people in very anticlimactic and visually unappealing ways (quick gunshots, underwater and unseen deaths).Maybe some people will be taken with the shot composition and retro feel combined with a modern shooting style, but in my opinion a film needs a lot more than vapid exploration of themes along with a nostalgic style to be interesting or entertaining.X's ultimate sin is it lacked the charm of the slashers of the past, and in trying to innovate within the genre completely missed the point of it."
"X","Leofwine_draca","2 November 2022",310,"X (2022) is a recent horror from Ti West that feels like a homage to THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE complete with '70s trappings and grindhouse feel. The story is about the actors and crew of a low budget porn shoot heading to a remote cabin owned by a couple of oldsters. All goes well until nightfall, when murderous intentions arise and things soon turn into a night of terror. I hadn't liked West's CABIN FEVER 2 or HOUSE OF THE DEVIL and didn't expect to like this either, and - surprise! - I hated it.It's not a slow burner (for a change) but it is void of horror content, or any interesting content at all really. For the first hour nothing happens apart from time-wasting with annoying characters, bad dialogue, and endless sex scenes that smack of padding. In the last 45 minutes it becomes a fairly gory but unconvincing slasher, with bad makeup and more cliches than you can shake a stick at. It's the film's senselessness that really got to me, like the female crew member who suddenly decides she wants to star in the shoot. Yeah, okay, that would happen."
"X","Horror_Flick_Fanatic","20 March 2022",510,"While I knew this film was presented as a slasher film going in, I had better expectations given it was an A24 Studios film. Despite some of the famous names in the cast, I wouldn't consider it good. Probably my least favorite from the A24 films. The film is made in the cinematography style of classic 1970s slasher films, but it holds back on the brutality with the females. I really wished A24 was above PC culture.True 70s slasher/horror films were very brutal with both genders but not this one except perhaps with the old woman/zomb-et at the end.I was hoping at least a slightly smarter screenplay given it is A24, but disappointingly no. Mia Goth was probably the only likable character in the film. But I feel the special effects people overdid the prosthetics with the old couple. They resemble zombie monsters far more than the elderly. They could have placed a real elderly couple in there instead. Yes, the film does have some gore and blood but its predominately a very tame film. The worst of it all is a disembowel cow hit by a truck on the highway. It's not even part of the main story and we also see the aftermath of the accident.I don't feel the film deserves to be elevated because of the technical production. Authentic 1970s low budget B films were not technically sophisticated in camera work and lighting. The fancy lighting and best cinematographers of the time were reserved for mainstream big studio films and not low budget horror. With today's pre-fab software plugins templates for adobe software, copying the style wasn't an Einstein endeavor. Had this film been made by any other no name production studio, it would have been relegated into another Netflix Original category and not given accolades. The recent Netflix Texas Chainsaw original from 2022 is just as good a film as this one minus the famous actors."

"X","cadillac20","18 March 2022",810,"Paying homage to the slashers of yesteryear is nothing new, but Ti West's new movie X makes it feel fresh. He does this by primarily bringing attention to the sex parts of the genre and exploring what sex means. This is, after all, in part about a crew of people attempting to make a porno. But the sex angle goes beyond just cheap titillation. It is at the heart of the film, and West seems to be most interested in what the experience means, whether it's for love, a way to recapture youth, or getting the most out of life while one is still capable of experiencing the act.Beyond all this, though, is a fun, classically styled slasher that is equal parts titillation and slasher mayhem. Some may find the amount of nudity and sex, and heck the subject matter itself, distasteful, but for slasher fans, this will remind you of much of the early years of the genre. A lot has been made about how this is so heavily inspired by Texas Chainsaw Massacre and it's easy to see why. The majority of the film revolves around the singular location, an old farm seemingly in the middle of nowhere, Texas, ripe for plenty of slasher fun. Ti doesn't skimp on the red stuff either. While nothing gets too outlandishly creative, we do get some brutal kills with often gory results.It helps that characters are written well and likable. Despite the sleazy material they're attempting to create, they don't feel shallow or sleazy themselves. They believe in their work and the reasons for making it. While it may have been nice to get a little more depth out of them, they clearly have history and there are things hinted at that never get much development, they're at least a decent crowd of folks who are fun to be around. As for the villains, they're not quite as out there or mysterious as the trailer would lead you to believe. In fact, they're pretty grounded, but never the less creepy and tension is maintained consistently once the violence starts.If you know what the film's about, you have a pretty good idea of what to expect. It does take some unusual turns, but for me that only added to just how much the film stood on it's own. It certainly feels like a fresh entry into the slasher genre, something the genre needs. Ti West continues to make a name for himself as someone to watch out for. Have fun with this sexy, bloody good time."
"X","HorrorEnjoyer","26 May 2022",110,"After reading the plot, I expected to see a generic slasher movie, however, what I got was a boring artsy-wannabe flick, which takes itself way too seriously and ends up being devoid of soul or any kind of entertainment.After 1 HOUR of extremely slow and tedious build-up you get presented by the most pathetic horror movie villains I have seen in my entire life. Scree-writer must have a serious phobia of frail old people, because that's the only way you'll find any kind of thrills in this movie.With a pretentious façade, one might think that such a movie would at least be devoid of clichés, but they are all there - loud sound jump scares, extremely dumb victims, completely unrealistic kills, which you see coming a mile away, and one of the most pathetic endings to the slasher movie ever.Just go rewatch Texas Chainsaw Massacre - both originals and remakes are a million times more entertaining than this boring mess."
"X","Top_Dawg_Critic","23 January 2023",910,"They don't make em like this anymore. Good old-school slasher-horror flicks from the 70's and 80's. Writer, producer, director and editor Ti West was stellar in every department in this exceptionally well put together film. The cinematography was top shelf - all genres considered, and his directing was just as great. Even the score and soundtrack was the best I've heard in a very long time. All casting and performances were excellent, especially the lovely Jenna Ortega, and Mia Goth in her dual roles as Maxine Minx and granny Pearl. Kid Cudi also had some good fun being cast as Jackson Hole. The gore, prosthetics and special effects were on point. There were even some surprisingly unexpected jump-scares where you wouldn't expect them - all due to simplistic yet creative filmmaking techniques. The writing had a nice flow to it with continuity and decent pacing, so the 105 min runtime passed by comfortably. There really isn't much to negatively critique in this little gem, except I wished for more narrative and sub-plots. It's a must-see if you're a fan of this genre, and a well deserved 9/10 from me."
"X","dan_da_man-60288","7 May 2023",110,"It's a trope that slashers have some aspect of sex in them, sure, but the entire first hour of this pos is just the result of a horny director who wanteed to make porn but also wants to pretend they're making a legit movie to their friends. So they filmed bad porn and then tacked 40 mins of slasher on the end.A solid hour of just ""look she STILL has her tits out"" and ""let's have another group discussion about the morals of dating a porn star,"" followed by a kill scene set to the most cliched song to ever be in a kill scene.I get that there's some stupid nonsensical lookalike story going on with a girl and the old woman, but every time she moves in tense moments and a big rubber mask is bending in unnatural ways it pulls you right out of the immersion.The pacing is all over the place. Some scenes just go on for way too long for basically no additional payoff. Like yes, the killer is obviously emotional, but I got that from the first 10 stabs, and the next 20 just had me waiting for it to be over. Some scenes are way too blunt, having a person wander into an area and get killed in about 1 min flat.There's very little imagination in the kill scenes, which may have flown in the decade it's set, but we've had decades of slashers and can expect a bit more these days than someone blatantly holding a knife behind their back stabbing someone. I really hope nobody lost any sleep trying to write that scene."

"X","aidanratesmovies","2 April 2022",610,"An interesting slow burn, but without enough to make it stand against the countless other slasher films, X is a fine film and another tribute to the iconic genre that made horror so popular in the first place. Granted, I do enjoy myself a slasher film from time to time- I'm quite fond of films like Nightmare on Elm Street and My Bloody Valentine, but where X faults among the others is through using a rather familiar formula without any true unique purpose. Throughout the film the characters often talk about an X factor, something that makes Mia Goth's character special and starworthy- but unlike its mentionings- this film just doesn't have that. The acting is really good, I love the underrated Mia Goth as always- as well as Brittany Snow, Martin Henderson, and even Kid Cudi did a rather impressive job. The cinematography is fantastic and perfectly fits the amitpshere and tone the film is going for. The music is enjoyable and tense, and its pacing can be a bit slow at times, but does allow for an interesting point of view. Its main problem lies solely in its script, which revolves largely around a smut film production- but takes too many elements and formulaic tendencies from other horror films like Evil Dead, Friday the 13th, The Visit and most obviously Texas Chainsaw Massacre to really stand out on its own and become its own thing. In the end, its not a bad watch, I wouldn't watch it again, but I certainly didn't mind watching it. It isn't the most memorable, but I certainly don't have any disdain for it. It just could have been more, especially given the talent involved, but ironically it settled for less.My Rating: 5.8/10."

That being said, I would not describe the Texas Chainsaw Massacre as high art. It is effectively schlock, good schlock, but schlock none the less. Schlock works when it is fun and creative, when it engages the viewer in its excesses. Schlock can, however, be elevated by a dedicated artist's vision, and that is what X attempts to do. It takes an established style and plot structure from B-movie horror of the past, now nostalgic in its appeal, and attempts to do three things, pay homage to those classics, elevate the material through artistic directing techniques not contemplated by the older films, and to talk about societies relationship to sex, youth, and religion in broad strokes. On all three accounts X is a failure.The film is not wholly without charm. Mia Goth is fantastic as the lead and the rest of the performances are solid. There are some beautiful shots, and the director has the courage to take some real chances with how he presents the intentionally textbook material. That is where my praise ends.The heart of the film is disappointing. Beautiful shots are ruined by the films tedious attempts to foreshadow its overbearing message. A perfect example is when Mia Goth's character, alone, goes for a swim in some stagnant water that is serene, yet ominous. Up to this point the film has been cultivating a relatively tense atmosphere through uncomfortable interactions with an elderly couple who owns the property where the rest of the characters are trying to surreptitiously film a porno. The scene didn't need blatant danger to feel creepy, but it instead elects to add a crocodile slowly following the main character bluntly foreshadowing danger in an incredibly cheap and contrived way. She is prey, and yet any audience member already knows that. They know X is a horror film. They know the old couple is evil because they are put in so much makeup and prosthetics that they hardly look human. The film is not clever when it moves slowly and blatantly shouts what it is attempting to do.Combined with the otherwise banal plot it's telegraphed unfolding, X also has much to say about sex, religion, and personhood, but it is so shallow in its interpretations of these concepts. In trying to be deep in comes across as shallow.Spoiler ahead, but the elderly woman's bloodlust is essentially fueled by her inability to feel desirable since she has aged. Her husband can no longer play the part of her romantic lover as the way she needs. She longs for the youth that the other characters have, and all the sexual and personal freedom it gives. The gang, on the other hand, are young and cocky and seek to leverage their youth to gain wealth and fame. They are vain people who are pretending to have deeper connection than they actually have (one girl talks about faking her interest during scenes, while the head honcho talks about all women being the same, etc., the film is never subtle). Mia Goth's character, while the softest spoken, still harps about how she wants to be successful above all else, like she deserves the fame she believes appearing in pornography will bring.The commentary here completely lacks nuance. These people don't inspire sympathy, but they don't deserve their fate. The film seems to critique old conservative forms of sex, yet the main thrust of the film is that making a porno and youthful hubris gets many people killed. The main character leaves the carnage at the end, but rather than relief at a quick getaway (a la Texas Chainsaw Massacre) she feels like John Wayne esq hero leaving victorious, which made little sense. To make matters worse the kills are boring. I found the first murder unbearably artsy in a way that felt unearned, and the rest were total duds, with one possible exception.

"X","Leofwine_draca","2 November 2022",310,"X (2022) is a recent horror from Ti West that feels like a homage to THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE complete with '70s trappings and grindhouse feel. The story is about the actors and crew of a low budget porn shoot heading to a remote cabin owned by a couple of oldsters. All goes well until nightfall, when murderous intentions arise and things soon turn into a night of terror. I hadn't liked West's CABIN FEVER 2 or HOUSE OF THE DEVIL and didn't expect to like this either, and - surprise! - I hated it.It's not a slow burner (for a change) but it is void of horror content, or any interesting content at all really. For the first hour nothing happens apart from time-wasting with annoying characters, bad dialogue, and endless sex scenes that smack of padding. In the last 45 minutes it becomes a fairly gory but unconvincing slasher, with bad makeup and more cliches than you can shake a stick at. It's the film's senselessness that really got to me, like the female crew member who suddenly decides she wants to star in the shoot. Yeah, okay, that would happen."
"X","Horror_Flick_Fanatic","20 March 2022",510,"While I knew this film was presented as a slasher film going in, I had better expectations given it was an A24 Studios film. Despite some of the famous names in the cast, I wouldn't consider it good. Probably my least favorite from the A24 films. The film is made in the cinematography style of classic 1970s slasher films, but it holds back on the brutality with the females. I really wished A24 was above PC culture.True 70s slasher/horror films were very brutal with both genders but not this one except perhaps with the old woman/zomb-et at the end.I was hoping at least a slightly smarter screenplay given it is A24, but disappointingly no. Mia Goth was probably the only likable character in the film. But I feel the special effects people overdid the prosthetics with the old couple. They resemble zombie monsters far more than the elderly. They could have placed a real elderly couple in there instead. Yes, the film does have some gore and blood but its predominately a very tame film. The worst of it all is a disembowel cow hit by a truck on the highway. It's not even part of the main story and we also see the aftermath of the accident.I don't feel the film deserves to be elevated because of the technical production. Authentic 1970s low budget B films were not technically sophisticated in camera work and lighting. The fancy lighting and best cinematographers of the time were reserved for mainstream big studio films and not low budget horror. With today's pre-fab software plugins templates for adobe software, copying the style wasn't an Einstein endeavor. Had this film been made by any other no name production studio, it would have been relegated into another Netflix Original category and not given accolades. The recent Netflix Texas Chainsaw original from 2022 is just as good a film as this one minus the famous actors."

That's it. That's the whole friggin movie!!!!! I just wasted 1 and half hours of my life jezzuzzz!!!!! Shame on a24 !!!"
"X","cadillac20","18 March 2022",810,"Paying homage to the slashers of yesteryear is nothing new, but Ti West's new movie X makes it feel fresh. He does this by primarily bringing attention to the sex parts of the genre and exploring what sex means. This is, after all, in part about a crew of people attempting to make a porno. But the sex angle goes beyond just cheap titillation. It is at the heart of the film, and West seems to be most interested in what the experience means, whether it's for love, a way to recapture youth, or getting the most out of life while one is still capable of experiencing the act.Beyond all this, though, is a fun, classically styled slasher that is equal parts titillation and slasher mayhem. Some may find the amount of nudity and sex, and heck the subject matter itself, distasteful, but for slasher fans, this will remind you of much of the early years of the genre. A lot has been made about how this is so heavily inspired by Texas Chainsaw Massacre and it's easy to see why. The majority of the film revolves around the singular location, an old farm seemingly in the middle of nowhere, Texas, ripe for plenty of slasher fun. Ti doesn't skimp on the red stuff either. While nothing gets too outlandishly creative, we do get some brutal kills with often gory results.It helps that characters are written well and likable. Despite the sleazy material they're attempting to create, they don't feel shallow or sleazy themselves. They believe in their work and the reasons for making it. While it may have been nice to get a little more depth out of them, they clearly have history and there are things hinted at that never get much development, they're at least a decent crowd of folks who are fun to be around. As for the villains, they're not quite as out there or mysterious as the trailer would lead you to believe. In fact, they're pretty grounded, but never the less creepy and tension is maintained consistently once the violence starts.If you know what the film's about, you have a pretty good idea of what to expect. It does take some unusual turns, but for me that only added to just how much the film stood on it's own. It certainly feels like a fresh entry into the slasher genre, something the genre needs. Ti West continues to make a name for himself as someone to watch out for. Have fun with this sexy, bloody good time."
"X","HorrorEnjoyer","26 May 2022",110,"After reading the plot, I expected to see a generic slasher movie, however, what I got was a boring artsy-wannabe flick, which takes itself way too seriously and ends up being devoid of soul or any kind of entertainment.After 1 HOUR of extremely slow and tedious build-up you get presented by the most pathetic horror movie villains I have seen in my entire life. Scree-writer must have a serious phobia of frail old people, because that's the only way you'll find any kind of thrills in this movie.With a pretentious façade, one might think that such a movie would at least be devoid of clichés, but they are all there - loud sound jump scares, extremely dumb victims, completely unrealistic kills, which you see coming a mile away, and one of the most pathetic endings to the slasher movie ever.Just go rewatch Texas Chainsaw Massacre - both originals and remakes are a million times more entertaining than this boring mess."
"X","Top_Dawg_Critic","23 January 2023",910,"They don't make em like this anymore. Good old-school slasher-horror flicks from the 70's and 80's. Writer, producer, director and editor Ti West was stellar in every department in this exceptionally well put together film. The cinematography was top shelf - all genres considered, and his directing was just as great. Even the score and soundtrack was the best I've heard in a very long time. All casting and performances were excellent, especially the lovely Jenna Ortega, and Mia Goth in her dual roles as Maxine Minx and granny Pearl. Kid Cudi also had some good fun being cast as Jackson Hole. The gore, prosthetics and special effects were on point. There were even some surprisingly unexpected jump-scares where you wouldn't expect them - all due to simplistic yet creative filmmaking techniques. The writing had a nice flow to it with continuity and decent pacing, so the 105 min runtime passed by comfortably. There really isn't much to negatively critique in this little gem, except I wished for more narrative and sub-plots. It's a must-see if you're a fan of this genre, and a well deserved 9/10 from me."
"X","dan_da_man-60288","7 May 2023",110,"It's a trope that slashers have some aspect of sex in them, sure, but the entire first hour of this pos is just the result of a horny director who wanteed to make porn but also wants to pretend they're making a legit movie to their friends. So they filmed bad porn and then tacked 40 mins of slasher on the end.A solid hour of just ""look she STILL has her tits out"" and ""let's have another group discussion about the morals of dating a porn star,"" followed by a kill scene set to the most cliched song to ever be in a kill scene.I get that there's some stupid nonsensical lookalike story going on with a girl and the old woman, but every time she moves in tense moments and a big rubber mask is bending in unnatural ways it pulls you right out of the immersion.The pacing is all over the place. Some scenes just go on for way too long for basically no additional payoff. Like yes, the killer is obviously emotional, but I got that from the first 10 stabs, and the next 20 just had me waiting for it to be over. Some scenes are way too blunt, having a person wander into an area and get killed in about 1 min flat.There's very little imagination in the kill scenes, which may have flown in the decade it's set, but we've had decades of slashers and can expect a bit more these days than someone blatantly holding a knife behind their back stabbing someone. I really hope nobody lost any sleep trying to write that scene."

It's a solid hour before any horror kicks in but when it does it's VERY bloody, gruesome and pretty sick.

"X","gortx","31 March 2022",NA,"Ti West's movie really should have been called ""E"" for elevated. It sets itself up as a smart take on the slasher films of the 70s and early 80s. As a bonus, the film within a film has the filmmakers making an 'elevated' porn flick (as a bonus, actor Owen Campbell who plays the ""Director"" even looks a bit like Director Tobe Hooper).Quite consciously taking it's set up from Tobe Hooper's 1974 TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, X has a group of randy pornographers renting a farmhouse from an elderly couple in the middle of nowhere in Texas (actually New Zealand). Writer-Director West's main idea here is to set up a contrast between the XXX filmmakers and the bible thumping civilians of the area. It's not an uninteresting idea, which, of course, plays off the the puritanical cliche in the slasher films of yore where the most sexually active characters are the most likely to g et killed off. In addition to MASSACRE, West includes nods to FRIDAY THE 13TH, Hooper's EATEN ALIVE and a very specific one to HALLOWEEN. X is set about 5 years after MASSACRE so that it can include a brief exchange about how home video will change the porno industry (adult films were already available on VHS for about 3 years).The movie is very well directed, with savvy use of cross-cutting between the porn film in the making and the terrors that await the group. Mia Goth (in a dual role; actually a triple if you stay after the credits) and Brittany Snow are the two pornstars to be and each dive in with relish. Kid Cudi is the cocky stud, while Martin Henderson is solid as the confidant Producer. Jenna Ortega is the ""crew"" all by her lonesome (she manages to keep her clothes on - must have a better agent). Stephen Ure is the ornery old man who rents out his guest house.As good as the filmmaking is, X ends up feeling too studied. The pacing is lugubrious even if it picks up towards the very end. Once the massacre begins (if not by power tools) it still ends up being fairly typical of the films it's commenting on, regardless of how well executed and 'elevated' it thinks it is. It's also too drawn out to satisfy some gore-hounds and once the blood starts flowing, probably too gross for the internet scribes dreaming of doing extended online essays dissecting it for it's elevated intellect. There are a couple of twists, but they aren't sufficient enough to compensate for the predictability.In the end, it's not as clever as West thinks it is, and despite some good Directing chops and acting, it's simply too self-conscious to be much of a fun thrill ride."
"X","johannes2000-1","16 March 2022",810,"I liked it. It's a nice old-fashioned (flawlessly 70's styled) slasher horror-flick, with a fairly original premise. As in any comparable horror movie the motives for the killings are pretty farfetched, but who cares, when they are pictured so relentlessley gruesome, the gore here is definitely not for the tender-hearted. Another strong point is how the movie very gradually builds up the tension, this is a real slow burner, the apprehension of looming doom is palpable throughout the movie. This is helped by a strong direction, a very clever and inventive editing, and some great photography, see for instance the scene of one of the girls swimming in the lake, while... well, I won't give it away, but it's beautiful and hair-raisingly scary at the same time!Add to all this some very funny dialogues and goings-on at the start, and you're in for a well made, old-school horror flick, maybe not life-changing but absolutely entertaining for those who can apprciate this kind of movie (like me!)."

There was a semi-interesting idea here but the stated motivations of the ""nearby enemy"" (as they are identified in a spoiler-free way in the ""storyline"") are hard to believe.So, there are some very mild scenes of adult entertainment here, but the supposed ""horror"" element fails miserably. There's a scene in a barn which ends absurdly -- what might have been a (pleasantly) nasty moment is just a damp squib.While I appreciate that the victims are not meant to realise they are in danger, I really think the audience needs to feel their peril on their behalf. This just failed miserably in that respect because the motivations of the other characters were just so hard to believe."

I hadn't liked West's CABIN FEVER 2 or HOUSE OF THE DEVIL and didn't expect to like this either, and - surprise! - I hated it.It's not a slow burner (for a change) but it is void of horror content, or any interesting content at all really. For the first hour nothing happens apart from time-wasting with annoying characters, bad dialogue, and endless sex scenes that smack of padding. In the last 45 minutes it becomes a fairly gory but unconvincing slasher, with bad makeup and more cliches than you can shake a stick at.

"X","Horror_Flick_Fanatic","20 March 2022",510,"While I knew this film was presented as a slasher film going in, I had better expectations given it was an A24 Studios film. Despite some of the famous names in the cast, I wouldn't consider it good. Probably my least favorite from the A24 films. The film is made in the cinematography style of classic 1970s slasher films, but it holds back on the brutality with the females. I really wished A24 was above PC culture.True 70s slasher/horror films were very brutal with both genders but not this one except perhaps with the old woman/zomb-et at the end.I was hoping at least a slightly smarter screenplay given it is A24, but disappointingly no. Mia Goth was probably the only likable character in the film. But I feel the special effects people overdid the prosthetics with the old couple. They resemble zombie monsters far more than the elderly. They could have placed a real elderly couple in there instead. Yes, the film does have some gore and blood but its predominately a very tame film. The worst of it all is a disembowel cow hit by a truck on the highway. It's not even part of the main story and we also see the aftermath of the accident.I don't feel the film deserves to be elevated because of the technical production. Authentic 1970s low budget B films were not technically sophisticated in camera work and lighting. The fancy lighting and best cinematographers of the time were reserved for mainstream big studio films and not low budget horror.

"X","cadillac20","18 March 2022",810,"Paying homage to the slashers of yesteryear is nothing new, but Ti West's new movie X makes it feel fresh. He does this by primarily bringing attention to the sex parts of the genre and exploring what sex means. This is, after all, in part about a crew of people attempting to make a porno. But the sex angle goes beyond just cheap titillation. It is at the heart of the film, and West seems to be most interested in what the experience means, whether it's for love, a way to recapture youth, or getting the most out of life while one is still capable of experiencing the act.Beyond all this, though, is a fun, classically styled slasher that is equal parts titillation and slasher mayhem. Some may find the amount of nudity and sex, and heck the subject matter itself, distasteful, but for slasher fans, this will remind you of much of the early years of the genre. A lot has been made about how this is so heavily inspired by Texas Chainsaw Massacre and it's easy to see why. The majority of the film revolves around the singular location, an old farm seemingly in the middle of nowhere, Texas, ripe for plenty of slasher fun. Ti doesn't skimp on the red stuff either. While nothing gets too outlandishly creative, we do get some brutal kills with often gory results.It helps that characters are written well and likable. Despite the sleazy material they're attempting to create, they don't feel shallow or sleazy themselves. They believe in their work and the reasons for making it. While it may have been nice to get a little more depth out of them, they clearly have history and there are things hinted at that never get much development, they're at least a decent crowd of folks who are fun to be around. As for the villains, they're not quite as out there or mysterious as the trailer would lead you to believe. In fact, they're pretty grounded, but never the less creepy and tension is maintained consistently once the violence starts.If you know what the film's about, you have a pretty good idea of what to expect. It does take some unusual turns, but for me that only added to just how much the film stood on it's own. It certainly feels like a fresh entry into the slasher genre, something the genre needs. Ti West continues to make a name for himself as someone to watch out for. Have fun with this sexy, bloody good time."

"X","Top_Dawg_Critic","23 January 2023",910,"They don't make em like this anymore. Good old-school slasher-horror flicks from the 70's and 80's. Writer, producer, director and editor Ti West was stellar in every department in this exceptionally well put together film. The cinematography was top shelf - all genres considered, and his directing was just as great. Even the score and soundtrack was the best I've heard in a very long time. All casting and performances were excellent, especially the lovely Jenna Ortega, and Mia Goth in her dual roles as Maxine Minx and granny Pearl. Kid Cudi also had some good fun being cast as Jackson Hole. The gore, prosthetics and special effects were on point. There were even some surprisingly unexpected jump-scares where you wouldn't expect them - all due to simplistic yet creative filmmaking techniques. The writing had a nice flow to it with continuity and decent pacing, so the 105 min runtime passed by comfortably. There really isn't much to negatively critique in this little gem, except I wished for more narrative and sub-plots. It's a must-see if you're a fan of this genre, and a well deserved 9/10 from me."
"X","dan_da_man-60288","7 May 2023",110,"It's a trope that slashers have some aspect of sex in them, sure, but the entire first hour of this pos is just the result of a horny director who wanteed to make porn but also wants to pretend they're making a legit movie to their friends. So they filmed bad porn and then tacked 40 mins of slasher on the end.A solid hour of just ""look she STILL has her tits out"" and ""let's have another group discussion about the morals of dating a porn star,"" followed by a kill scene set to the most cliched song to ever be in a kill scene.I get that there's some stupid nonsensical lookalike story going on with a girl and the old woman, but every time she moves in tense moments and a big rubber mask is bending in unnatural ways it pulls you right out of the immersion.The pacing is all over the place. Some scenes just go on for way too long for basically no additional payoff. Like yes, the killer is obviously emotional, but I got that from the first 10 stabs, and the next 20 just had me waiting for it to be over. Some scenes are way too blunt, having a person wander into an area and get killed in about 1 min flat.There's very little imagination in the kill scenes, which may have flown in the decade it's set, but we've had decades of slashers and can expect a bit more these days than someone blatantly holding a knife behind their back stabbing someone. I really hope nobody lost any sleep trying to write that scene."

It's a solid hour before any horror kicks in but when it does it's VERY bloody, gruesome and pretty sick.

"X","gortx","31 March 2022",NA,"Ti West's movie really should have been called ""E"" for elevated. It sets itself up as a smart take on the slasher films of the 70s and early 80s. As a bonus, the film within a film has the filmmakers making an 'elevated' porn flick (as a bonus, actor Owen Campbell who plays the ""Director"" even looks a bit like Director Tobe Hooper).Quite consciously taking it's set up from Tobe Hooper's 1974 TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, X has a group of randy pornographers renting a farmhouse from an elderly couple in the middle of nowhere in Texas (actually New Zealand). Writer-Director West's main idea here is to set up a contrast between the XXX filmmakers and the bible thumping civilians of the area. It's not an uninteresting idea, which, of course, plays off the the puritanical cliche in the slasher films of yore where the most sexually active characters are the most likely to g et killed off. In addition to MASSACRE, West includes nods to FRIDAY THE 13TH, Hooper's EATEN ALIVE and a very specific one to HALLOWEEN. X is set about 5 years after MASSACRE so that it can include a brief exchange about how home video will change the porno industry (adult films were already available on VHS for about 3 years).The movie is very well directed, with savvy use of cross-cutting between the porn film in the making and the terrors that await the group. Mia Goth (in a dual role; actually a triple if you stay after the credits) and Brittany Snow are the two pornstars to be and each dive in with relish. Kid Cudi is the cocky stud, while Martin Henderson is solid as the confidant Producer. Jenna Ortega is the ""crew"" all by her lonesome (she manages to keep her clothes on - must have a better agent). Stephen Ure is the ornery old man who rents out his guest house.As good as the filmmaking is, X ends up feeling too studied. The pacing is lugubrious even if it picks up towards the very end. Once the massacre begins (if not by power tools) it still ends up being fairly typical of the films it's commenting on, regardless of how well executed and 'elevated' it thinks it is. It's also too drawn out to satisfy some gore-hounds and once the blood starts flowing, probably too gross for the internet scribes dreaming of doing extended online essays dissecting it for it's elevated intellect. There are a couple of twists, but they aren't sufficient enough to compensate for the predictability.In the end, it's not as clever as West thinks it is, and despite some good Directing chops and acting, it's simply too self-conscious to be much of a fun thrill ride."
"X","johannes2000-1","16 March 2022",810,"I liked it. It's a nice old-fashioned (flawlessly 70's styled) slasher horror-flick, with a fairly original premise. As in any comparable horror movie the motives for the killings are pretty farfetched, but who cares, when they are pictured so relentlessley gruesome, the gore here is definitely not for the tender-hearted. Another strong point is how the movie very gradually builds up the tension, this is a real slow burner, the apprehension of looming doom is palpable throughout the movie. This is helped by a strong direction, a very clever and inventive editing, and some great photography, see for instance the scene of one of the girls swimming in the lake, while... well, I won't give it away, but it's beautiful and hair-raisingly scary at the same time!Add to all this some very funny dialogues and goings-on at the start, and you're in for a well made, old-school horror flick, maybe not life-changing but absolutely entertaining for those who can apprciate this kind of movie (like me!)."

"X","frukuk","6 January 2024",210,"One star each for casting Mia Goth and Brittany Snow, but zero stars for the underdeveloped screenplay and the rest of it. There was a semi-interesting idea here but the stated motivations of the ""nearby enemy"" (as they are identified in a spoiler-free way in the ""storyline"") are hard to believe.So, there are some very mild scenes of adult entertainment here, but the supposed ""horror"" element fails miserably. There's a scene in a barn which ends absurdly -- what might have been a (pleasantly) nasty moment is just a damp squib.While I appreciate that the victims are not meant to realise they are in danger, I really think the audience needs to feel their peril on their behalf. This just failed miserably in that respect because the motivations of the other characters were just so hard to believe."
"X","JoBloTheMovieCritic","19 March 2022",510,"5/10 - while it was nice to see Brittany Snow on the big screen again after the Pitch Perfect movies and it continued Jenna Ortega's Hollywood takeover, this utterly bizarre, inconsistent, and incomplete attempt at a ""sexy slasher"" starts off strong but a few moments aside, becomes utterly laughable in the last 45 minutes."
"X","miles670","15 April 2022",710,"I didn't know what to expect going into this movie. Some reviews said it was porn with some horror, some said it was a slasher B movie. Some said decent acting and a good gore fest.It was all of the above, though I'd say less porn, there are some nude/sex scenes but they're really not the heart of the movie. The gore is well done, the acting is very good I think, and the overall slasher aspect is reasonable, though it could have been a little more creative.Saying all of that none of it is what I'll remember this movie for. What really struck me in this movie was the portrayal of age and how it affects people and their relationships, I actually felt really sad for some of the characters in this movie, and that isn't usually how I'd expect to feel watching a slasher. It really did feel like the writers, directors,. And actors were trying to remind us of something whilst also making a decent slasher. I think it's to value our youth, and our lives as much as we can. I don't want to say much more as I don't want to spoil the movie. Needless to say if you're looking for a decent movie to check out I'd recommend giving this a go. It will entertain you and also make you think a little about the problems others have."
"X","aidanratesmovies","2 April 2022",610,"An interesting slow burn, but without enough to make it stand against the countless other slasher films, X is a fine film and another tribute to the iconic genre that made horror so popular in the first place. Granted, I do enjoy myself a slasher film from time to time- I'm quite fond of films like Nightmare on Elm Street and My Bloody Valentine, but where X faults among the others is through using a rather familiar formula without any true unique purpose. Throughout the film the characters often talk about an X factor, something that makes Mia Goth's character special and starworthy- but unlike its mentionings- this film just doesn't have that. The acting is really good, I love the underrated Mia Goth as always- as well as Brittany Snow, Martin Henderson, and even Kid Cudi did a rather impressive job. The cinematography is fantastic and perfectly fits the amitpshere and tone the film is going for. The music is enjoyable and tense, and its pacing can be a bit slow at times, but does allow for an interesting point of view. Its main problem lies solely in its script, which revolves largely around a smut film production- but takes too many elements and formulaic tendencies from other horror films like Evil Dead, Friday the 13th, The Visit and most obviously Texas Chainsaw Massacre to really stand out on its own and become its own thing. In the end, its not a bad watch, I wouldn't watch it again, but I certainly didn't mind watching it. It isn't the most memorable, but I certainly don't have any disdain for it. It just could have been more, especially given the talent involved, but ironically it settled for less.My Rating: 5.8/10."
"X","fpcholcomb","29 November 2023",210,"I love the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I love it for its idiosyncrasies, its low budget ingenuity, its colorful villains, its charming flaws. That being said, I would not describe the Texas Chainsaw Massacre as high art. It is effectively schlock, good schlock, but schlock none the less. Schlock works when it is fun and creative, when it engages the viewer in its excesses. Schlock can, however, be elevated by a dedicated artist's vision, and that is what X attempts to do. It takes an established style and plot structure from B-movie horror of the past, now nostalgic in its appeal, and attempts to do three things, pay homage to those classics, elevate the material through artistic directing techniques not contemplated by the older films, and to talk about societies relationship to sex, youth, and religion in broad strokes. On all three accounts X is a failure.The film is not wholly without charm. Mia Goth is fantastic as the lead and the rest of the performances are solid. There are some beautiful shots, and the director has the courage to take some real chances with how he presents the intentionally textbook material. That is where my praise ends.The heart of the film is disappointing. Beautiful shots are ruined by the films tedious attempts to foreshadow its overbearing message. A perfect example is when Mia Goth's character, alone, goes for a swim in some stagnant water that is serene, yet ominous. Up to this point the film has been cultivating a relatively tense atmosphere through uncomfortable interactions with an elderly couple who owns the property where the rest of the characters are trying to surreptitiously film a porno. The scene didn't need blatant danger to feel creepy, but it instead elects to add a crocodile slowly following the main character bluntly foreshadowing danger in an incredibly cheap and contrived way. She is prey, and yet any audience member already knows that. They know X is a horror film. They know the old couple is evil because they are put in so much makeup and prosthetics that they hardly look human. The film is not clever when it moves slowly and blatantly shouts what it is attempting to do.Combined with the otherwise banal plot it's telegraphed unfolding, X also has much to say about sex, religion, and personhood, but it is so shallow in its interpretations of these concepts. In trying to be deep in comes across as shallow.Spoiler ahead, but the elderly woman's bloodlust is essentially fueled by her inability to feel desirable since she has aged. Her husband can no longer play the part of her romantic lover as the way she needs. She longs for the youth that the other characters have, and all the sexual and personal freedom it gives. The gang, on the other hand, are young and cocky and seek to leverage their youth to gain wealth and fame. They are vain people who are pretending to have deeper connection than they actually have (one girl talks about faking her interest during scenes, while the head honcho talks about all women being the same, etc., the film is never subtle). Mia Goth's character, while the softest spoken, still harps about how she wants to be successful above all else, like she deserves the fame she believes appearing in pornography will bring.The commentary here completely lacks nuance. These people don't inspire sympathy, but they don't deserve their fate. The film seems to critique old conservative forms of sex, yet the main thrust of the film is that making a porno and youthful hubris gets many people killed. The main character leaves the carnage at the end, but rather than relief at a quick getaway (a la Texas Chainsaw Massacre) she feels like John Wayne esq hero leaving victorious, which made little sense. To make matters worse the kills are boring. I found the first murder unbearably artsy in a way that felt unearned, and the rest were total duds, with one possible exception. The film wants to make art of gruesome murders, but also kills a lot of people in very anticlimactic and visually unappealing ways (quick gunshots, underwater and unseen deaths).Maybe some people will be taken with the shot composition and retro feel combined with a modern shooting style, but in my opinion a film needs a lot more than vapid exploration of themes along with a nostalgic style to be interesting or entertaining.X's ultimate sin is it lacked the charm of the slashers of the past, and in trying to innovate within the genre completely missed the point of it."

"X","gortx","31 March 2022",NA,"Ti West's movie really should have been called ""E"" for elevated. It sets itself up as a smart take on the slasher films of the 70s and early 80s. As a bonus, the film within a film has the filmmakers making an 'elevated' porn flick (as a bonus, actor Owen Campbell who plays the ""Director"" even looks a bit like Director Tobe Hooper).Quite consciously taking it's set up from Tobe Hooper's 1974 TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, X has a group of randy pornographers renting a farmhouse from an elderly couple in the middle of nowhere in Texas (actually New Zealand). Writer-Director West's main idea here is to set up a contrast between the XXX filmmakers and the bible thumping civilians of the area. It's not an uninteresting idea, which, of course, plays off the the puritanical cliche in the slasher films of yore where the most sexually active characters are the most likely to g et killed off. In addition to MASSACRE, West includes nods to FRIDAY THE 13TH, Hooper's EATEN ALIVE and a very specific one to HALLOWEEN. X is set about 5 years after MASSACRE so that it can include a brief exchange about how home video will change the porno industry (adult films were already available on VHS for about 3 years).The movie is very well directed, with savvy use of cross-cutting between the porn film in the making and the terrors that await the group. Mia Goth (in a dual role; actually a triple if you stay after the credits) and Brittany Snow are the two pornstars to be and each dive in with relish. Kid Cudi is the cocky stud, while Martin Henderson is solid as the confidant Producer. Jenna Ortega is the ""crew"" all by her lonesome (she manages to keep her clothes on - must have a better agent). Stephen Ure is the ornery old man who rents out his guest house.As good as the filmmaking is, X ends up feeling too studied. The pacing is lugubrious even if it picks up towards the very end. Once the massacre begins (if not by power tools) it still ends up being fairly typical of the films it's commenting on, regardless of how well executed and 'elevated' it thinks it is. It's also too drawn out to satisfy some gore-hounds and once the blood starts flowing, probably too gross for the internet scribes dreaming of doing extended online essays dissecting it for it's elevated intellect. There are a couple of twists, but they aren't sufficient enough to compensate for the predictability.In the end, it's not as clever as West thinks it is, and despite some good Directing chops and acting, it's simply too self-conscious to be much of a fun thrill ride."
"X","johannes2000-1","16 March 2022",810,"I liked it. It's a nice old-fashioned (flawlessly 70's styled) slasher horror-flick, with a fairly original premise. As in any comparable horror movie the motives for the killings are pretty farfetched, but who cares, when they are pictured so relentlessley gruesome, the gore here is definitely not for the tender-hearted. Another strong point is how the movie very gradually builds up the tension, this is a real slow burner, the apprehension of looming doom is palpable throughout the movie. This is helped by a strong direction, a very clever and inventive editing, and some great photography, see for instance the scene of one of the girls swimming in the lake, while... well, I won't give it away, but it's beautiful and hair-raisingly scary at the same time!Add to all this some very funny dialogues and goings-on at the start, and you're in for a well made, old-school horror flick, maybe not life-changing but absolutely entertaining for those who can apprciate this kind of movie (like me!)."
"X","tchitouniaram","16 April 2022",310,"My expectations were quite high for this film ... After watching it , I just don't understand what's all the hype is about ?

Highly not recommended !"
"X","frukuk","6 January 2024",210,"One star each for casting Mia Goth and Brittany Snow, but zero stars for the underdeveloped screenplay and the rest of it. There was a semi-interesting idea here but the stated motivations of the ""nearby enemy"" (as they are identified in a spoiler-free way in the ""storyline"") are hard to believe.So, there are some very mild scenes of adult entertainment here, but the supposed ""horror"" element fails miserably. There's a scene in a barn which ends absurdly -- what might have been a (pleasantly) nasty moment is just a damp squib.While I appreciate that the victims are not meant to realise they are in danger, I really think the audience needs to feel their peril on their behalf. This just failed miserably in that respect because the motivations of the other characters were just so hard to believe."

"X","miles670","15 April 2022",710,"I didn't know what to expect going into this movie. Some reviews said it was porn with some horror, some said it was a slasher B movie. Some said decent acting and a good gore fest.It was all of the above, though I'd say less porn, there are some nude/sex scenes but they're really not the heart of the movie. The gore is well done, the acting is very good I think, and the overall slasher aspect is reasonable, though it could have been a little more creative.Saying all of that none of it is what I'll remember this movie for. What really struck me in this movie was the portrayal of age and how it affects people and their relationships, I actually felt really sad for some of the characters in this movie, and that isn't usually how I'd expect to feel watching a slasher. It really did feel like the writers, directors,. And actors were trying to remind us of something whilst also making a decent slasher. I think it's to value our youth, and our lives as much as we can. I don't want to say much more as I don't want to spoil the movie. Needless to say if you're looking for a decent movie to check out I'd recommend giving this a go. It will entertain you and also make you think a little about the problems others have."
"X","aidanratesmovies","2 April 2022",610,"An interesting slow burn, but without enough to make it stand against the countless other slasher films, X is a fine film and another tribute to the iconic genre that made horror so popular in the first place. Granted, I do enjoy myself a slasher film from time to time- I'm quite fond of films like Nightmare on Elm Street and My Bloody Valentine, but where X faults among the others is through using a rather familiar formula without any true unique purpose. Throughout the film the characters often talk about an X factor, something that makes Mia Goth's character special and starworthy- but unlike its mentionings- this film just doesn't have that. The acting is really good, I love the underrated Mia Goth as always- as well as Brittany Snow, Martin Henderson, and even Kid Cudi did a rather impressive job. The cinematography is fantastic and perfectly fits the amitpshere and tone the film is going for. The music is enjoyable and tense, and its pacing can be a bit slow at times, but does allow for an interesting point of view. Its main problem lies solely in its script, which revolves largely around a smut film production- but takes too many elements and formulaic tendencies from other horror films like Evil Dead, Friday the 13th, The Visit and most obviously Texas Chainsaw Massacre to really stand out on its own and become its own thing. In the end, its not a bad watch, I wouldn't watch it again, but I certainly didn't mind watching it. It isn't the most memorable, but I certainly don't have any disdain for it. It just could have been more, especially given the talent involved, but ironically it settled for less.My Rating: 5.8/10."
"X","fpcholcomb","29 November 2023",210,"I love the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I love it for its idiosyncrasies, its low budget ingenuity, its colorful villains, its charming flaws. That being said, I would not describe the Texas Chainsaw Massacre as high art. It is effectively schlock, good schlock, but schlock none the less. Schlock works when it is fun and creative, when it engages the viewer in its excesses. Schlock can, however, be elevated by a dedicated artist's vision, and that is what X attempts to do. It takes an established style and plot structure from B-movie horror of the past, now nostalgic in its appeal, and attempts to do three things, pay homage to those classics, elevate the material through artistic directing techniques not contemplated by the older films, and to talk about societies relationship to sex, youth, and religion in broad strokes. On all three accounts X is a failure.The film is not wholly without charm. Mia Goth is fantastic as the lead and the rest of the performances are solid. There are some beautiful shots, and the director has the courage to take some real chances with how he presents the intentionally textbook material. That is where my praise ends.The heart of the film is disappointing. Beautiful shots are ruined by the films tedious attempts to foreshadow its overbearing message. A perfect example is when Mia Goth's character, alone, goes for a swim in some stagnant water that is serene, yet ominous. Up to this point the film has been cultivating a relatively tense atmosphere through uncomfortable interactions with an elderly couple who owns the property where the rest of the characters are trying to surreptitiously film a porno. The scene didn't need blatant danger to feel creepy, but it instead elects to add a crocodile slowly following the main character bluntly foreshadowing danger in an incredibly cheap and contrived way. She is prey, and yet any audience member already knows that. They know X is a horror film. They know the old couple is evil because they are put in so much makeup and prosthetics that they hardly look human. The film is not clever when it moves slowly and blatantly shouts what it is attempting to do.Combined with the otherwise banal plot it's telegraphed unfolding, X also has much to say about sex, religion, and personhood, but it is so shallow in its interpretations of these concepts. In trying to be deep in comes across as shallow.Spoiler ahead, but the elderly woman's bloodlust is essentially fueled by her inability to feel desirable since she has aged. Her husband can no longer play the part of her romantic lover as the way she needs. She longs for the youth that the other characters have, and all the sexual and personal freedom it gives. The gang, on the other hand, are young and cocky and seek to leverage their youth to gain wealth and fame. They are vain people who are pretending to have deeper connection than they actually have (one girl talks about faking her interest during scenes, while the head honcho talks about all women being the same, etc., the film is never subtle). Mia Goth's character, while the softest spoken, still harps about how she wants to be successful above all else, like she deserves the fame she believes appearing in pornography will bring.The commentary here completely lacks nuance. These people don't inspire sympathy, but they don't deserve their fate. The film seems to critique old conservative forms of sex, yet the main thrust of the film is that making a porno and youthful hubris gets many people killed. The main character leaves the carnage at the end, but rather than relief at a quick getaway (a la Texas Chainsaw Massacre) she feels like John Wayne esq hero leaving victorious, which made little sense. To make matters worse the kills are boring. I found the first murder unbearably artsy in a way that felt unearned, and the rest were total duds, with one possible exception. The film wants to make art of gruesome murders, but also kills a lot of people in very anticlimactic and visually unappealing ways (quick gunshots, underwater and unseen deaths).Maybe some people will be taken with the shot composition and retro feel combined with a modern shooting style, but in my opinion a film needs a lot more than vapid exploration of themes along with a nostalgic style to be interesting or entertaining.X's ultimate sin is it lacked the charm of the slashers of the past, and in trying to innovate within the genre completely missed the point of it."
"X","Leofwine_draca","2 November 2022",310,"X (2022) is a recent horror from Ti West that feels like a homage to THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE complete with '70s trappings and grindhouse feel. The story is about the actors and crew of a low budget porn shoot heading to a remote cabin owned by a couple of oldsters. All goes well until nightfall, when murderous intentions arise and things soon turn into a night of terror. I hadn't liked West's CABIN FEVER 2 or HOUSE OF THE DEVIL and didn't expect to like this either, and - surprise! - I hated it.It's not a slow burner (for a change) but it is void of horror content, or any interesting content at all really. For the first hour nothing happens apart from time-wasting with annoying characters, bad dialogue, and endless sex scenes that smack of padding. In the last 45 minutes it becomes a fairly gory but unconvincing slasher, with bad makeup and more cliches than you can shake a stick at. It's the film's senselessness that really got to me, like the female crew member who suddenly decides she wants to star in the shoot. Yeah, okay, that would happen."
"X","Horror_Flick_Fanatic","20 March 2022",510,"While I knew this film was presented as a slasher film going in, I had better expectations given it was an A24 Studios film. Despite some of the famous names in the cast, I wouldn't consider it good. Probably my least favorite from the A24 films. The film is made in the cinematography style of classic 1970s slasher films, but it holds back on the brutality with the females. I really wished A24 was above PC culture.True 70s slasher/horror films were very brutal with both genders but not this one except perhaps with the old woman/zomb-et at the end.I was hoping at least a slightly smarter screenplay given it is A24, but disappointingly no. Mia Goth was probably the only likable character in the film. But I feel the special effects people overdid the prosthetics with the old couple. They resemble zombie monsters far more than the elderly. They could have placed a real elderly couple in there instead. Yes, the film does have some gore and blood but its predominately a very tame film. The worst of it all is a disembowel cow hit by a truck on the highway. It's not even part of the main story and we also see the aftermath of the accident.I don't feel the film deserves to be elevated because of the technical production. Authentic 1970s low budget B films were not technically sophisticated in camera work and lighting. The fancy lighting and best cinematographers of the time were reserved for mainstream big studio films and not low budget horror. With today's pre-fab software plugins templates for adobe software, copying the style wasn't an Einstein endeavor. Had this film been made by any other no name production studio, it would have been relegated into another Netflix Original category and not given accolades. The recent Netflix Texas Chainsaw original from 2022 is just as good a film as this one minus the famous actors."

"X","cadillac20","18 March 2022",810,"Paying homage to the slashers of yesteryear is nothing new, but Ti West's new movie X makes it feel fresh. He does this by primarily bringing attention to the sex parts of the genre and exploring what sex means. This is, after all, in part about a crew of people attempting to make a porno. But the sex angle goes beyond just cheap titillation. It is at the heart of the film, and West seems to be most interested in what the experience means, whether it's for love, a way to recapture youth, or getting the most out of life while one is still capable of experiencing the act.Beyond all this, though, is a fun, classically styled slasher that is equal parts titillation and slasher mayhem. Some may find the amount of nudity and sex, and heck the subject matter itself, distasteful, but for slasher fans, this will remind you of much of the early years of the genre. A lot has been made about how this is so heavily inspired by Texas Chainsaw Massacre and it's easy to see why. The majority of the film revolves around the singular location, an old farm seemingly in the middle of nowhere, Texas, ripe for plenty of slasher fun. Ti doesn't skimp on the red stuff either. While nothing gets too outlandishly creative, we do get some brutal kills with often gory results.It helps that characters are written well and likable. Despite the sleazy material they're attempting to create, they don't feel shallow or sleazy themselves. They believe in their work and the reasons for making it. While it may have been nice to get a little more depth out of them, they clearly have history and there are things hinted at that never get much development, they're at least a decent crowd of folks who are fun to be around. As for the villains, they're not quite as out there or mysterious as the trailer would lead you to believe. In fact, they're pretty grounded, but never the less creepy and tension is maintained consistently once the violence starts.If you know what the film's about, you have a pretty good idea of what to expect. It does take some unusual turns, but for me that only added to just how much the film stood on it's own. It certainly feels like a fresh entry into the slasher genre, something the genre needs. Ti West continues to make a name for himself as someone to watch out for. Have fun with this sexy, bloody good time."

"X","gortx","31 March 2022",NA,"Ti West's movie really should have been called ""E"" for elevated. It sets itself up as a smart take on the slasher films of the 70s and early 80s. As a bonus, the film within a film has the filmmakers making an 'elevated' porn flick (as a bonus, actor Owen Campbell who plays the ""Director"" even looks a bit like Director Tobe Hooper).Quite consciously taking it's set up from Tobe Hooper's 1974 TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, X has a group of randy pornographers renting a farmhouse from an elderly couple in the middle of nowhere in Texas (actually New Zealand). Writer-Director West's main idea here is to set up a contrast between the XXX filmmakers and the bible thumping civilians of the area. It's not an uninteresting idea, which, of course, plays off the the puritanical cliche in the slasher films of yore where the most sexually active characters are the most likely to g et killed off. In addition to MASSACRE, West includes nods to FRIDAY THE 13TH, Hooper's EATEN ALIVE and a very specific one to HALLOWEEN. X is set about 5 years after MASSACRE so that it can include a brief exchange about how home video will change the porno industry (adult films were already available on VHS for about 3 years).The movie is very well directed, with savvy use of cross-cutting between the porn film in the making and the terrors that await the group. Mia Goth (in a dual role; actually a triple if you stay after the credits) and Brittany Snow are the two pornstars to be and each dive in with relish. Kid Cudi is the cocky stud, while Martin Henderson is solid as the confidant Producer. Jenna Ortega is the ""crew"" all by her lonesome (she manages to keep her clothes on - must have a better agent). Stephen Ure is the ornery old man who rents out his guest house.As good as the filmmaking is, X ends up feeling too studied. The pacing is lugubrious even if it picks up towards the very end. Once the massacre begins (if not by power tools) it still ends up being fairly typical of the films it's commenting on, regardless of how well executed and 'elevated' it thinks it is. It's also too drawn out to satisfy some gore-hounds and once the blood starts flowing, probably too gross for the internet scribes dreaming of doing extended online essays dissecting it for it's elevated intellect.

"X","johannes2000-1","16 March 2022",810,"I liked it. It's a nice old-fashioned (flawlessly 70's styled) slasher horror-flick, with a fairly original premise. As in any comparable horror movie the motives for the killings are pretty farfetched, but who cares, when they are pictured so relentlessley gruesome, the gore here is definitely not for the tender-hearted. Another strong point is how the movie very gradually builds up the tension, this is a real slow burner, the apprehension of looming doom is palpable throughout the movie. This is helped by a strong direction, a very clever and inventive editing, and some great photography, see for instance the scene of one of the girls swimming in the lake, while... well, I won't give it away, but it's beautiful and hair-raisingly scary at the same time!Add to all this some very funny dialogues and goings-on at the start, and you're in for a well made, old-school horror flick, maybe not life-changing but absolutely entertaining for those who can apprciate this kind of movie (like me!)."

"X","miles670","15 April 2022",710,"I didn't know what to expect going into this movie. Some reviews said it was porn with some horror, some said it was a slasher B movie. Some said decent acting and a good gore fest.It was all of the above, though I'd say less porn, there are some nude/sex scenes but they're really not the heart of the movie. The gore is well done, the acting is very good I think, and the overall slasher aspect is reasonable, though it could have been a little more creative.Saying all of that none of it is what I'll remember this movie for. What really struck me in this movie was the portrayal of age and how it affects people and their relationships, I actually felt really sad for some of the characters in this movie, and that isn't usually how I'd expect to feel watching a slasher. It really did feel like the writers, directors,. And actors were trying to remind us of something whilst also making a decent slasher. I think it's to value our youth, and our lives as much as we can. I don't want to say much more as I don't want to spoil the movie. Needless to say if you're looking for a decent movie to check out I'd recommend giving this a go. It will entertain you and also make you think a little about the problems others have."
"X","aidanratesmovies","2 April 2022",610,"An interesting slow burn, but without enough to make it stand against the countless other slasher films, X is a fine film and another tribute to the iconic genre that made horror so popular in the first place. Granted, I do enjoy myself a slasher film from time to time- I'm quite fond of films like Nightmare on Elm Street and My Bloody Valentine, but where X faults among the others is through using a rather familiar formula without any true unique purpose. Throughout the film the characters often talk about an X factor, something that makes Mia Goth's character special and starworthy- but unlike its mentionings- this film just doesn't have that. The acting is really good, I love the underrated Mia Goth as always- as well as Brittany Snow, Martin Henderson, and even Kid Cudi did a rather impressive job. The cinematography is fantastic and perfectly fits the amitpshere and tone the film is going for. The music is enjoyable and tense, and its pacing can be a bit slow at times, but does allow for an interesting point of view. Its main problem lies solely in its script, which revolves largely around a smut film production- but takes too many elements and formulaic tendencies from other horror films like Evil Dead, Friday the 13th, The Visit and most obviously Texas Chainsaw Massacre to really stand out on its own and become its own thing. In the end, its not a bad watch, I wouldn't watch it again, but I certainly didn't mind watching it. It isn't the most memorable, but I certainly don't have any disdain for it. It just could have been more, especially given the talent involved, but ironically it settled for less.My Rating: 5.8/10."
"X","fpcholcomb","29 November 2023",210,"I love the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I love it for its idiosyncrasies, its low budget ingenuity, its colorful villains, its charming flaws. That being said, I would not describe the Texas Chainsaw Massacre as high art. It is effectively schlock, good schlock, but schlock none the less. Schlock works when it is fun and creative, when it engages the viewer in its excesses. Schlock can, however, be elevated by a dedicated artist's vision, and that is what X attempts to do. It takes an established style and plot structure from B-movie horror of the past, now nostalgic in its appeal, and attempts to do three things, pay homage to those classics, elevate the material through artistic directing techniques not contemplated by the older films, and to talk about societies relationship to sex, youth, and religion in broad strokes. On all three accounts X is a failure.The film is not wholly without charm. Mia Goth is fantastic as the lead and the rest of the performances are solid. There are some beautiful shots, and the director has the courage to take some real chances with how he presents the intentionally textbook material. That is where my praise ends.The heart of the film is disappointing. Beautiful shots are ruined by the films tedious attempts to foreshadow its overbearing message. A perfect example is when Mia Goth's character, alone, goes for a swim in some stagnant water that is serene, yet ominous. Up to this point the film has been cultivating a relatively tense atmosphere through uncomfortable interactions with an elderly couple who owns the property where the rest of the characters are trying to surreptitiously film a porno. The scene didn't need blatant danger to feel creepy, but it instead elects to add a crocodile slowly following the main character bluntly foreshadowing danger in an incredibly cheap and contrived way. She is prey, and yet any audience member already knows that. They know X is a horror film. They know the old couple is evil because they are put in so much makeup and prosthetics that they hardly look human. The film is not clever when it moves slowly and blatantly shouts what it is attempting to do.Combined with the otherwise banal plot it's telegraphed unfolding, X also has much to say about sex, religion, and personhood, but it is so shallow in its interpretations of these concepts. In trying to be deep in comes across as shallow.Spoiler ahead, but the elderly woman's bloodlust is essentially fueled by her inability to feel desirable since she has aged. Her husband can no longer play the part of her romantic lover as the way she needs. She longs for the youth that the other characters have, and all the sexual and personal freedom it gives. The gang, on the other hand, are young and cocky and seek to leverage their youth to gain wealth and fame. They are vain people who are pretending to have deeper connection than they actually have (one girl talks about faking her interest during scenes, while the head honcho talks about all women being the same, etc., the film is never subtle). Mia Goth's character, while the softest spoken, still harps about how she wants to be successful above all else, like she deserves the fame she believes appearing in pornography will bring.The commentary here completely lacks nuance. These people don't inspire sympathy, but they don't deserve their fate. The film seems to critique old conservative forms of sex, yet the main thrust of the film is that making a porno and youthful hubris gets many people killed. The main character leaves the carnage at the end, but rather than relief at a quick getaway (a la Texas Chainsaw Massacre) she feels like John Wayne esq hero leaving victorious, which made little sense. To make matters worse the kills are boring. I found the first murder unbearably artsy in a way that felt unearned, and the rest were total duds, with one possible exception. The film wants to make art of gruesome murders, but also kills a lot of people in very anticlimactic and visually unappealing ways (quick gunshots, underwater and unseen deaths).Maybe some people will be taken with the shot composition and retro feel combined with a modern shooting style, but in my opinion a film needs a lot more than vapid exploration of themes along with a nostalgic style to be interesting or entertaining.X's ultimate sin is it lacked the charm of the slashers of the past, and in trying to innovate within the genre completely missed the point of it."
"X","Leofwine_draca","2 November 2022",310,"X (2022) is a recent horror from Ti West that feels like a homage to THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE complete with '70s trappings and grindhouse feel. The story is about the actors and crew of a low budget porn shoot heading to a remote cabin owned by a couple of oldsters. All goes well until nightfall, when murderous intentions arise and things soon turn into a night of terror. I hadn't liked West's CABIN FEVER 2 or HOUSE OF THE DEVIL and didn't expect to like this either, and - surprise! - I hated it.It's not a slow burner (for a change) but it is void of horror content, or any interesting content at all really. For the first hour nothing happens apart from time-wasting with annoying characters, bad dialogue, and endless sex scenes that smack of padding. In the last 45 minutes it becomes a fairly gory but unconvincing slasher, with bad makeup and more cliches than you can shake a stick at. It's the film's senselessness that really got to me, like the female crew member who suddenly decides she wants to star in the shoot. Yeah, okay, that would happen."
"X","Horror_Flick_Fanatic","20 March 2022",510,"While I knew this film was presented as a slasher film going in, I had better expectations given it was an A24 Studios film. Despite some of the famous names in the cast, I wouldn't consider it good. Probably my least favorite from the A24 films. The film is made in the cinematography style of classic 1970s slasher films, but it holds back on the brutality with the females. I really wished A24 was above PC culture.True 70s slasher/horror films were very brutal with both genders but not this one except perhaps with the old woman/zomb-et at the end.I was hoping at least a slightly smarter screenplay given it is A24, but disappointingly no. Mia Goth was probably the only likable character in the film. But I feel the special effects people overdid the prosthetics with the old couple. They resemble zombie monsters far more than the elderly. They could have placed a real elderly couple in there instead. Yes, the film does have some gore and blood but its predominately a very tame film. The worst of it all is a disembowel cow hit by a truck on the highway. It's not even part of the main story and we also see the aftermath of the accident.I don't feel the film deserves to be elevated because of the technical production. Authentic 1970s low budget B films were not technically sophisticated in camera work and lighting. The fancy lighting and best cinematographers of the time were reserved for mainstream big studio films and not low budget horror. With today's pre-fab software plugins templates for adobe software, copying the style wasn't an Einstein endeavor. Had this film been made by any other no name production studio, it would have been relegated into another Netflix Original category and not given accolades. The recent Netflix Texas Chainsaw original from 2022 is just as good a film as this one minus the famous actors."

"X","cadillac20","18 March 2022",810,"Paying homage to the slashers of yesteryear is nothing new, but Ti West's new movie X makes it feel fresh. He does this by primarily bringing attention to the sex parts of the genre and exploring what sex means. This is, after all, in part about a crew of people attempting to make a porno. But the sex angle goes beyond just cheap titillation. It is at the heart of the film, and West seems to be most interested in what the experience means, whether it's for love, a way to recapture youth, or getting the most out of life while one is still capable of experiencing the act.Beyond all this, though, is a fun, classically styled slasher that is equal parts titillation and slasher mayhem. Some may find the amount of nudity and sex, and heck the subject matter itself, distasteful, but for slasher fans, this will remind you of much of the early years of the genre. A lot has been made about how this is so heavily inspired by Texas Chainsaw Massacre and it's easy to see why. The majority of the film revolves around the singular location, an old farm seemingly in the middle of nowhere, Texas, ripe for plenty of slasher fun. Ti doesn't skimp on the red stuff either. While nothing gets too outlandishly creative, we do get some brutal kills with often gory results.It helps that characters are written well and likable. Despite the sleazy material they're attempting to create, they don't feel shallow or sleazy themselves. They believe in their work and the reasons for making it. While it may have been nice to get a little more depth out of them, they clearly have history and there are things hinted at that never get much development, they're at least a decent crowd of folks who are fun to be around. As for the villains, they're not quite as out there or mysterious as the trailer would lead you to believe. In fact, they're pretty grounded, but never the less creepy and tension is maintained consistently once the violence starts.If you know what the film's about, you have a pretty good idea of what to expect. It does take some unusual turns, but for me that only added to just how much the film stood on it's own. It certainly feels like a fresh entry into the slasher genre, something the genre needs. Ti West continues to make a name for himself as someone to watch out for. Have fun with this sexy, bloody good time."
"X","HorrorEnjoyer","26 May 2022",110,"After reading the plot, I expected to see a generic slasher movie, however, what I got was a boring artsy-wannabe flick, which takes itself way too seriously and ends up being devoid of soul or any kind of entertainment.After 1 HOUR of extremely slow and tedious build-up you get presented by the most pathetic horror movie villains I have seen in my entire life. Scree-writer must have a serious phobia of frail old people, because that's the only way you'll find any kind of thrills in this movie.With a pretentious façade, one might think that such a movie would at least be devoid of clichés, but they are all there - loud sound jump scares, extremely dumb victims, completely unrealistic kills, which you see coming a mile away, and one of the most pathetic endings to the slasher movie ever.Just go rewatch Texas Chainsaw Massacre - both originals and remakes are a million times more entertaining than this boring mess."
"X","Top_Dawg_Critic","23 January 2023",910,"They don't make em like this anymore. Good old-school slasher-horror flicks from the 70's and 80's. Writer, producer, director and editor Ti West was stellar in every department in this exceptionally well put together film. The cinematography was top shelf - all genres considered, and his directing was just as great. Even the score and soundtrack was the best I've heard in a very long time. All casting and performances were excellent, especially the lovely Jenna Ortega, and Mia Goth in her dual roles as Maxine Minx and granny Pearl. Kid Cudi also had some good fun being cast as Jackson Hole. The gore, prosthetics and special effects were on point. There were even some surprisingly unexpected jump-scares where you wouldn't expect them - all due to simplistic yet creative filmmaking techniques. The writing had a nice flow to it with continuity and decent pacing, so the 105 min runtime passed by comfortably. There really isn't much to negatively critique in this little gem, except I wished for more narrative and sub-plots. It's a must-see if you're a fan of this genre, and a well deserved 9/10 from me."
"X","dan_da_man-60288","7 May 2023",110,"It's a trope that slashers have some aspect of sex in them, sure, but the entire first hour of this pos is just the result of a horny director who wanteed to make porn but also wants to pretend they're making a legit movie to their friends. So they filmed bad porn and then tacked 40 mins of slasher on the end.A solid hour of just ""look she STILL has her tits out"" and ""let's have another group discussion about the morals of dating a porn star,"" followed by a kill scene set to the most cliched song to ever be in a kill scene.I get that there's some stupid nonsensical lookalike story going on with a girl and the old woman, but every time she moves in tense moments and a big rubber mask is bending in unnatural ways it pulls you right out of the immersion.The pacing is all over the place. Some scenes just go on for way too long for basically no additional payoff. Like yes, the killer is obviously emotional, but I got that from the first 10 stabs, and the next 20 just had me waiting for it to be over. Some scenes are way too blunt, having a person wander into an area and get killed in about 1 min flat.There's very little imagination in the kill scenes, which may have flown in the decade it's set, but we've had decades of slashers and can expect a bit more these days than someone blatantly holding a knife behind their back stabbing someone. I really hope nobody lost any sleep trying to write that scene."

"X","miles670","15 April 2022",710,"I didn't know what to expect going into this movie. Some reviews said it was porn with some horror, some said it was a slasher B movie. Some said decent acting and a good gore fest.It was all of the above, though I'd say less porn, there are some nude/sex scenes but they're really not the heart of the movie. The gore is well done, the acting is very good I think, and the overall slasher aspect is reasonable, though it could have been a little more creative.Saying all of that none of it is what I'll remember this movie for. What really struck me in this movie was the portrayal of age and how it affects people and their relationships, I actually felt really sad for some of the characters in this movie, and that isn't usually how I'd expect to feel watching a slasher. It really did feel like the writers, directors,. And actors were trying to remind us of something whilst also making a decent slasher. I think it's to value our youth, and our lives as much as we can. I don't want to say much more as I don't want to spoil the movie.

"X","aidanratesmovies","2 April 2022",610,"An interesting slow burn, but without enough to make it stand against the countless other slasher films, X is a fine film and another tribute to the iconic genre that made horror so popular in the first place. Granted, I do enjoy myself a slasher film from time to time- I'm quite fond of films like Nightmare on Elm Street and My Bloody Valentine, but where X faults among the others is through using a rather familiar formula without any true unique purpose. Throughout the film the characters often talk about an X factor, something that makes Mia Goth's character special and starworthy- but unlike its mentionings- this film just doesn't have that. The acting is really good, I love the underrated Mia Goth as always- as well as Brittany Snow, Martin Henderson, and even Kid Cudi did a rather impressive job. The cinematography is fantastic and perfectly fits the amitpshere and tone the film is going for. The music is enjoyable and tense, and its pacing can be a bit slow at times, but does allow for an interesting point of view. Its main problem lies solely in its script, which revolves largely around a smut film production- but takes too many elements and formulaic tendencies from other horror films like Evil Dead, Friday the 13th, The Visit and most obviously Texas Chainsaw Massacre to really stand out on its own and become its own thing. In the end, its not a bad watch, I wouldn't watch it again, but I certainly didn't mind watching it. It isn't the most memorable, but I certainly don't have any disdain for it. It just could have been more, especially given the talent involved, but ironically it settled for less.My Rating: 5.8/10."
"X","fpcholcomb","29 November 2023",210,"I love the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I love it for its idiosyncrasies, its low budget ingenuity, its colorful villains, its charming flaws. That being said, I would not describe the Texas Chainsaw Massacre as high art. It is effectively schlock, good schlock, but schlock none the less. Schlock works when it is fun and creative, when it engages the viewer in its excesses. Schlock can, however, be elevated by a dedicated artist's vision, and that is what X attempts to do. It takes an established style and plot structure from B-movie horror of the past, now nostalgic in its appeal, and attempts to do three things, pay homage to those classics, elevate the material through artistic directing techniques not contemplated by the older films, and to talk about societies relationship to sex, youth, and religion in broad strokes. On all three accounts X is a failure.The film is not wholly without charm. Mia Goth is fantastic as the lead and the rest of the performances are solid. There are some beautiful shots, and the director has the courage to take some real chances with how he presents the intentionally textbook material. That is where my praise ends.The heart of the film is disappointing. Beautiful shots are ruined by the films tedious attempts to foreshadow its overbearing message. A perfect example is when Mia Goth's character, alone, goes for a swim in some stagnant water that is serene, yet ominous. Up to this point the film has been cultivating a relatively tense atmosphere through uncomfortable interactions with an elderly couple who owns the property where the rest of the characters are trying to surreptitiously film a porno. The scene didn't need blatant danger to feel creepy, but it instead elects to add a crocodile slowly following the main character bluntly foreshadowing danger in an incredibly cheap and contrived way. She is prey, and yet any audience member already knows that. They know X is a horror film. They know the old couple is evil because they are put in so much makeup and prosthetics that they hardly look human. The film is not clever when it moves slowly and blatantly shouts what it is attempting to do.Combined with the otherwise banal plot it's telegraphed unfolding, X also has much to say about sex, religion, and personhood, but it is so shallow in its interpretations of these concepts. In trying to be deep in comes across as shallow.Spoiler ahead, but the elderly woman's bloodlust is essentially fueled by her inability to feel desirable since she has aged. Her husband can no longer play the part of her romantic lover as the way she needs. She longs for the youth that the other characters have, and all the sexual and personal freedom it gives. The gang, on the other hand, are young and cocky and seek to leverage their youth to gain wealth and fame. They are vain people who are pretending to have deeper connection than they actually have (one girl talks about faking her interest during scenes, while the head honcho talks about all women being the same, etc., the film is never subtle). Mia Goth's character, while the softest spoken, still harps about how she wants to be successful above all else, like she deserves the fame she believes appearing in pornography will bring.The commentary here completely lacks nuance. These people don't inspire sympathy, but they don't deserve their fate. The film seems to critique old conservative forms of sex, yet the main thrust of the film is that making a porno and youthful hubris gets many people killed. The main character leaves the carnage at the end, but rather than relief at a quick getaway (a la Texas Chainsaw Massacre) she feels like John Wayne esq hero leaving victorious, which made little sense. To make matters worse the kills are boring. I found the first murder unbearably artsy in a way that felt unearned, and the rest were total duds, with one possible exception. The film wants to make art of gruesome murders, but also kills a lot of people in very anticlimactic and visually unappealing ways (quick gunshots, underwater and unseen deaths).Maybe some people will be taken with the shot composition and retro feel combined with a modern shooting style, but in my opinion a film needs a lot more than vapid exploration of themes along with a nostalgic style to be interesting or entertaining.X's ultimate sin is it lacked the charm of the slashers of the past, and in trying to innovate within the genre completely missed the point of it."
"X","Leofwine_draca","2 November 2022",310,"X (2022) is a recent horror from Ti West that feels like a homage to THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE complete with '70s trappings and grindhouse feel. The story is about the actors and crew of a low budget porn shoot heading to a remote cabin owned by a couple of oldsters. All goes well until nightfall, when murderous intentions arise and things soon turn into a night of terror. I hadn't liked West's CABIN FEVER 2 or HOUSE OF THE DEVIL and didn't expect to like this either, and - surprise! - I hated it.It's not a slow burner (for a change) but it is void of horror content, or any interesting content at all really. For the first hour nothing happens apart from time-wasting with annoying characters, bad dialogue, and endless sex scenes that smack of padding. In the last 45 minutes it becomes a fairly gory but unconvincing slasher, with bad makeup and more cliches than you can shake a stick at. It's the film's senselessness that really got to me, like the female crew member who suddenly decides she wants to star in the shoot. Yeah, okay, that would happen."
"X","Horror_Flick_Fanatic","20 March 2022",510,"While I knew this film was presented as a slasher film going in, I had better expectations given it was an A24 Studios film. Despite some of the famous names in the cast, I wouldn't consider it good. Probably my least favorite from the A24 films. The film is made in the cinematography style of classic 1970s slasher films, but it holds back on the brutality with the females. I really wished A24 was above PC culture.True 70s slasher/horror films were very brutal with both genders but not this one except perhaps with the old woman/zomb-et at the end.I was hoping at least a slightly smarter screenplay given it is A24, but disappointingly no. Mia Goth was probably the only likable character in the film. But I feel the special effects people overdid the prosthetics with the old couple. They resemble zombie monsters far more than the elderly. They could have placed a real elderly couple in there instead. Yes, the film does have some gore and blood but its predominately a very tame film. The worst of it all is a disembowel cow hit by a truck on the highway. It's not even part of the main story and we also see the aftermath of the accident.I don't feel the film deserves to be elevated because of the technical production. Authentic 1970s low budget B films were not technically sophisticated in camera work and lighting. The fancy lighting and best cinematographers of the time were reserved for mainstream big studio films and not low budget horror. With today's pre-fab software plugins templates for adobe software, copying the style wasn't an Einstein endeavor. Had this film been made by any other no name production studio, it would have been relegated into another Netflix Original category and not given accolades. The recent Netflix Texas Chainsaw original from 2022 is just as good a film as this one minus the famous actors."

"X","cadillac20","18 March 2022",810,"Paying homage to the slashers of yesteryear is nothing new, but Ti West's new movie X makes it feel fresh. He does this by primarily bringing attention to the sex parts of the genre and exploring what sex means. This is, after all, in part about a crew of people attempting to make a porno. But the sex angle goes beyond just cheap titillation. It is at the heart of the film, and West seems to be most interested in what the experience means, whether it's for love, a way to recapture youth, or getting the most out of life while one is still capable of experiencing the act.Beyond all this, though, is a fun, classically styled slasher that is equal parts titillation and slasher mayhem. Some may find the amount of nudity and sex, and heck the subject matter itself, distasteful, but for slasher fans, this will remind you of much of the early years of the genre. A lot has been made about how this is so heavily inspired by Texas Chainsaw Massacre and it's easy to see why. The majority of the film revolves around the singular location, an old farm seemingly in the middle of nowhere, Texas, ripe for plenty of slasher fun. Ti doesn't skimp on the red stuff either. While nothing gets too outlandishly creative, we do get some brutal kills with often gory results.It helps that characters are written well and likable. Despite the sleazy material they're attempting to create, they don't feel shallow or sleazy themselves. They believe in their work and the reasons for making it. While it may have been nice to get a little more depth out of them, they clearly have history and there are things hinted at that never get much development, they're at least a decent crowd of folks who are fun to be around. As for the villains, they're not quite as out there or mysterious as the trailer would lead you to believe. In fact, they're pretty grounded, but never the less creepy and tension is maintained consistently once the violence starts.If you know what the film's about, you have a pretty good idea of what to expect. It does take some unusual turns, but for me that only added to just how much the film stood on it's own. It certainly feels like a fresh entry into the slasher genre, something the genre needs. Ti West continues to make a name for himself as someone to watch out for. Have fun with this sexy, bloody good time."
"X","HorrorEnjoyer","26 May 2022",110,"After reading the plot, I expected to see a generic slasher movie, however, what I got was a boring artsy-wannabe flick, which takes itself way too seriously and ends up being devoid of soul or any kind of entertainment.After 1 HOUR of extremely slow and tedious build-up you get presented by the most pathetic horror movie villains I have seen in my entire life. Scree-writer must have a serious phobia of frail old people, because that's the only way you'll find any kind of thrills in this movie.With a pretentious façade, one might think that such a movie would at least be devoid of clichés, but they are all there - loud sound jump scares, extremely dumb victims, completely unrealistic kills, which you see coming a mile away, and one of the most pathetic endings to the slasher movie ever.Just go rewatch Texas Chainsaw Massacre - both originals and remakes are a million times more entertaining than this boring mess."
"X","Top_Dawg_Critic","23 January 2023",910,"They don't make em like this anymore. Good old-school slasher-horror flicks from the 70's and 80's. Writer, producer, director and editor Ti West was stellar in every department in this exceptionally well put together film. The cinematography was top shelf - all genres considered, and his directing was just as great. Even the score and soundtrack was the best I've heard in a very long time. All casting and performances were excellent, especially the lovely Jenna Ortega, and Mia Goth in her dual roles as Maxine Minx and granny Pearl. Kid Cudi also had some good fun being cast as Jackson Hole. The gore, prosthetics and special effects were on point. There were even some surprisingly unexpected jump-scares where you wouldn't expect them - all due to simplistic yet creative filmmaking techniques. The writing had a nice flow to it with continuity and decent pacing, so the 105 min runtime passed by comfortably. There really isn't much to negatively critique in this little gem, except I wished for more narrative and sub-plots. It's a must-see if you're a fan of this genre, and a well deserved 9/10 from me."
"X","dan_da_man-60288","7 May 2023",110,"It's a trope that slashers have some aspect of sex in them, sure, but the entire first hour of this pos is just the result of a horny director who wanteed to make porn but also wants to pretend they're making a legit movie to their friends. So they filmed bad porn and then tacked 40 mins of slasher on the end.A solid hour of just ""look she STILL has her tits out"" and ""let's have another group discussion about the morals of dating a porn star,"" followed by a kill scene set to the most cliched song to ever be in a kill scene.I get that there's some stupid nonsensical lookalike story going on with a girl and the old woman, but every time she moves in tense moments and a big rubber mask is bending in unnatural ways it pulls you right out of the immersion.The pacing is all over the place. Some scenes just go on for way too long for basically no additional payoff. Like yes, the killer is obviously emotional, but I got that from the first 10 stabs, and the next 20 just had me waiting for it to be over. Some scenes are way too blunt, having a person wander into an area and get killed in about 1 min flat.There's very little imagination in the kill scenes, which may have flown in the decade it's set, but we've had decades of slashers and can expect a bit more these days than someone blatantly holding a knife behind their back stabbing someone. I really hope nobody lost any sleep trying to write that scene."

It's a solid hour before any horror kicks in but when it does it's VERY bloody, gruesome and pretty sick.

"X","gortx","31 March 2022",NA,"Ti West's movie really should have been called ""E"" for elevated. It sets itself up as a smart take on the slasher films of the 70s and early 80s. As a bonus, the film within a film has the filmmakers making an 'elevated' porn flick (as a bonus, actor Owen Campbell who plays the ""Director"" even looks a bit like Director Tobe Hooper).Quite consciously taking it's set up from Tobe Hooper's 1974 TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, X has a group of randy pornographers renting a farmhouse from an elderly couple in the middle of nowhere in Texas (actually New Zealand). Writer-Director West's main idea here is to set up a contrast between the XXX filmmakers and the bible thumping civilians of the area. It's not an uninteresting idea, which, of course, plays off the the puritanical cliche in the slasher films of yore where the most sexually active characters are the most likely to g et killed off. In addition to MASSACRE, West includes nods to FRIDAY THE 13TH, Hooper's EATEN ALIVE and a very specific one to HALLOWEEN. X is set about 5 years after MASSACRE so that it can include a brief exchange about how home video will change the porno industry (adult films were already available on VHS for about 3 years).The movie is very well directed, with savvy use of cross-cutting between the porn film in the making and the terrors that await the group. Mia Goth (in a dual role; actually a triple if you stay after the credits) and Brittany Snow are the two pornstars to be and each dive in with relish. Kid Cudi is the cocky stud, while Martin Henderson is solid as the confidant Producer. Jenna Ortega is the ""crew"" all by her lonesome (she manages to keep her clothes on - must have a better agent). Stephen Ure is the ornery old man who rents out his guest house.As good as the filmmaking is, X ends up feeling too studied. The pacing is lugubrious even if it picks up towards the very end. Once the massacre begins (if not by power tools) it still ends up being fairly typical of the films it's commenting on, regardless of how well executed and 'elevated' it thinks it is. It's also too drawn out to satisfy some gore-hounds and once the blood starts flowing, probably too gross for the internet scribes dreaming of doing extended online essays dissecting it for it's elevated intellect. There are a couple of twists, but they aren't sufficient enough to compensate for the predictability.In the end, it's not as clever as West thinks it is, and despite some good Directing chops and acting, it's simply too self-conscious to be much of a fun thrill ride."
"X","johannes2000-1","16 March 2022",810,"I liked it. It's a nice old-fashioned (flawlessly 70's styled) slasher horror-flick, with a fairly original premise. As in any comparable horror movie the motives for the killings are pretty farfetched, but who cares, when they are pictured so relentlessley gruesome, the gore here is definitely not for the tender-hearted. Another strong point is how the movie very gradually builds up the tension, this is a real slow burner, the apprehension of looming doom is palpable throughout the movie. This is helped by a strong direction, a very clever and inventive editing, and some great photography, see for instance the scene of one of the girls swimming in the lake, while... well, I won't give it away, but it's beautiful and hair-raisingly scary at the same time!Add to all this some very funny dialogues and goings-on at the start, and you're in for a well made, old-school horror flick, maybe not life-changing but absolutely entertaining for those who can apprciate this kind of movie (like me!)."

There's a scene in a barn which ends absurdly -- what might have been a (pleasantly) nasty moment is just a damp squib.While I appreciate that the victims are not meant to realise they are in danger, I really think the audience needs to feel their peril on their behalf.

"X","Leofwine_draca","2 November 2022",310,"X (2022) is a recent horror from Ti West that feels like a homage to THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE complete with '70s trappings and grindhouse feel. The story is about the actors and crew of a low budget porn shoot heading to a remote cabin owned by a couple of oldsters. All goes well until nightfall, when murderous intentions arise and things soon turn into a night of terror. I hadn't liked West's CABIN FEVER 2 or HOUSE OF THE DEVIL and didn't expect to like this either, and - surprise! - I hated it.It's not a slow burner (for a change) but it is void of horror content, or any interesting content at all really.

Despite some of the famous names in the cast, I wouldn't consider it good. Probably my least favorite from the A24 films. The film is made in the cinematography style of classic 1970s slasher films, but it holds back on the brutality with the females. I really wished A24 was above PC culture.True 70s slasher/horror films were very brutal with both genders but not this one except perhaps with the old woman/zomb-et at the end.I was hoping at least a slightly smarter screenplay given it is A24, but disappointingly no. Mia Goth was probably the only likable character in the film. But I feel the special effects people overdid the prosthetics with the old couple. They resemble zombie monsters far more than the elderly. They could have placed a real elderly couple in there instead. Yes, the film does have some gore and blood but its predominately a very tame film. The worst of it all is a disembowel cow hit by a truck on the highway. It's not even part of the main story and we also see the aftermath of the accident.I don't feel the film deserves to be elevated because of the technical production.

"X","cadillac20","18 March 2022",810,"Paying homage to the slashers of yesteryear is nothing new, but Ti West's new movie X makes it feel fresh. He does this by primarily bringing attention to the sex parts of the genre and exploring what sex means. This is, after all, in part about a crew of people attempting to make a porno. But the sex angle goes beyond just cheap titillation. It is at the heart of the film, and West seems to be most interested in what the experience means, whether it's for love, a way to recapture youth, or getting the most out of life while one is still capable of experiencing the act.Beyond all this, though, is a fun, classically styled slasher that is equal parts titillation and slasher mayhem. Some may find the amount of nudity and sex, and heck the subject matter itself, distasteful, but for slasher fans, this will remind you of much of the early years of the genre. A lot has been made about how this is so heavily inspired by Texas Chainsaw Massacre and it's easy to see why. The majority of the film revolves around the singular location, an old farm seemingly in the middle of nowhere, Texas, ripe for plenty of slasher fun. Ti doesn't skimp on the red stuff either. While nothing gets too outlandishly creative, we do get some brutal kills with often gory results.It helps that characters are written well and likable. Despite the sleazy material they're attempting to create, they don't feel shallow or sleazy themselves. They believe in their work and the reasons for making it. While it may have been nice to get a little more depth out of them, they clearly have history and there are things hinted at that never get much development, they're at least a decent crowd of folks who are fun to be around. As for the villains, they're not quite as out there or mysterious as the trailer would lead you to believe. In fact, they're pretty grounded, but never the less creepy and tension is maintained consistently once the violence starts.If you know what the film's about, you have a pretty good idea of what to expect. It does take some unusual turns, but for me that only added to just how much the film stood on it's own. It certainly feels like a fresh entry into the slasher genre, something the genre needs. Ti West continues to make a name for himself as someone to watch out for. Have fun with this sexy, bloody good time."
"X","HorrorEnjoyer","26 May 2022",110,"After reading the plot, I expected to see a generic slasher movie, however, what I got was a boring artsy-wannabe flick, which takes itself way too seriously and ends up being devoid of soul or any kind of entertainment.After 1 HOUR of extremely slow and tedious build-up you get presented by the most pathetic horror movie villains I have seen in my entire life. Scree-writer must have a serious phobia of frail old people, because that's the only way you'll find any kind of thrills in this movie.With a pretentious façade, one might think that such a movie would at least be devoid of clichés, but they are all there - loud sound jump scares, extremely dumb victims, completely unrealistic kills, which you see coming a mile away, and one of the most pathetic endings to the slasher movie ever.Just go rewatch Texas Chainsaw Massacre - both originals and remakes are a million times more entertaining than this boring mess."
"X","Top_Dawg_Critic","23 January 2023",910,"They don't make em like this anymore. Good old-school slasher-horror flicks from the 70's and 80's. Writer, producer, director and editor Ti West was stellar in every department in this exceptionally well put together film. The cinematography was top shelf - all genres considered, and his directing was just as great. Even the score and soundtrack was the best I've heard in a very long time. All casting and performances were excellent, especially the lovely Jenna Ortega, and Mia Goth in her dual roles as Maxine Minx and granny Pearl. Kid Cudi also had some good fun being cast as Jackson Hole. The gore, prosthetics and special effects were on point. There were even some surprisingly unexpected jump-scares where you wouldn't expect them - all due to simplistic yet creative filmmaking techniques. The writing had a nice flow to it with continuity and decent pacing, so the 105 min runtime passed by comfortably. There really isn't much to negatively critique in this little gem, except I wished for more narrative and sub-plots. It's a must-see if you're a fan of this genre, and a well deserved 9/10 from me."
"X","dan_da_man-60288","7 May 2023",110,"It's a trope that slashers have some aspect of sex in them, sure, but the entire first hour of this pos is just the result of a horny director who wanteed to make porn but also wants to pretend they're making a legit movie to their friends. So they filmed bad porn and then tacked 40 mins of slasher on the end.A solid hour of just ""look she STILL has her tits out"" and ""let's have another group discussion about the morals of dating a porn star,"" followed by a kill scene set to the most cliched song to ever be in a kill scene.I get that there's some stupid nonsensical lookalike story going on with a girl and the old woman, but every time she moves in tense moments and a big rubber mask is bending in unnatural ways it pulls you right out of the immersion.The pacing is all over the place. Some scenes just go on for way too long for basically no additional payoff. Like yes, the killer is obviously emotional, but I got that from the first 10 stabs, and the next 20 just had me waiting for it to be over. Some scenes are way too blunt, having a person wander into an area and get killed in about 1 min flat.There's very little imagination in the kill scenes, which may have flown in the decade it's set, but we've had decades of slashers and can expect a bit more these days than someone blatantly holding a knife behind their back stabbing someone. I really hope nobody lost any sleep trying to write that scene."

It's a solid hour before any horror kicks in but when it does it's VERY bloody, gruesome and pretty sick.

"X","gortx","31 March 2022",NA,"Ti West's movie really should have been called ""E"" for elevated. It sets itself up as a smart take on the slasher films of the 70s and early 80s. As a bonus, the film within a film has the filmmakers making an 'elevated' porn flick (as a bonus, actor Owen Campbell who plays the ""Director"" even looks a bit like Director Tobe Hooper).Quite consciously taking it's set up from Tobe Hooper's 1974 TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, X has a group of randy pornographers renting a farmhouse from an elderly couple in the middle of nowhere in Texas (actually New Zealand). Writer-Director West's main idea here is to set up a contrast between the XXX filmmakers and the bible thumping civilians of the area. It's not an uninteresting idea, which, of course, plays off the the puritanical cliche in the slasher films of yore where the most sexually active characters are the most likely to g et killed off. In addition to MASSACRE, West includes nods to FRIDAY THE 13TH, Hooper's EATEN ALIVE and a very specific one to HALLOWEEN. X is set about 5 years after MASSACRE so that it can include a brief exchange about how home video will change the porno industry (adult films were already available on VHS for about 3 years).The movie is very well directed, with savvy use of cross-cutting between the porn film in the making and the terrors that await the group. Mia Goth (in a dual role; actually a triple if you stay after the credits) and Brittany Snow are the two pornstars to be and each dive in with relish. Kid Cudi is the cocky stud, while Martin Henderson is solid as the confidant Producer. Jenna Ortega is the ""crew"" all by her lonesome (she manages to keep her clothes on - must have a better agent). Stephen Ure is the ornery old man who rents out his guest house.As good as the filmmaking is, X ends up feeling too studied. The pacing is lugubrious even if it picks up towards the very end. Once the massacre begins (if not by power tools) it still ends up being fairly typical of the films it's commenting on, regardless of how well executed and 'elevated' it thinks it is. It's also too drawn out to satisfy some gore-hounds and once the blood starts flowing, probably too gross for the internet scribes dreaming of doing extended online essays dissecting it for it's elevated intellect. There are a couple of twists, but they aren't sufficient enough to compensate for the predictability.In the end, it's not as clever as West thinks it is, and despite some good Directing chops and acting, it's simply too self-conscious to be much of a fun thrill ride."
"X","johannes2000-1","16 March 2022",810,"I liked it. It's a nice old-fashioned (flawlessly 70's styled) slasher horror-flick, with a fairly original premise. As in any comparable horror movie the motives for the killings are pretty farfetched, but who cares, when they are pictured so relentlessley gruesome, the gore here is definitely not for the tender-hearted. Another strong point is how the movie very gradually builds up the tension, this is a real slow burner, the apprehension of looming doom is palpable throughout the movie. This is helped by a strong direction, a very clever and inventive editing, and some great photography, see for instance the scene of one of the girls swimming in the lake, while... well, I won't give it away, but it's beautiful and hair-raisingly scary at the same time!Add to all this some very funny dialogues and goings-on at the start, and you're in for a well made, old-school horror flick, maybe not life-changing but absolutely entertaining for those who can apprciate this kind of movie (like me!)."

Highly not recommended !"
"X","frukuk","6 January 2024",210,"One star each for casting Mia Goth and Brittany Snow, but zero stars for the underdeveloped screenplay and the rest of it. There was a semi-interesting idea here but the stated motivations of the ""nearby enemy"" (as they are identified in a spoiler-free way in the ""storyline"") are hard to believe.So, there are some very mild scenes of adult entertainment here, but the supposed ""horror"" element fails miserably. There's a scene in a barn which ends absurdly -- what might have been a (pleasantly) nasty moment is just a damp squib.While I appreciate that the victims are not meant to realise they are in danger, I really think the audience needs to feel their peril on their behalf. This just failed miserably in that respect because the motivations of the other characters were just so hard to believe."
"X","JoBloTheMovieCritic","19 March 2022",510,"5/10 - while it was nice to see Brittany Snow on the big screen again after the Pitch Perfect movies and it continued Jenna Ortega's Hollywood takeover, this utterly bizarre, inconsistent, and incomplete attempt at a ""sexy slasher"" starts off strong but a few moments aside, becomes utterly laughable in the last 45 minutes."
"X","miles670","15 April 2022",710,"I didn't know what to expect going into this movie. Some reviews said it was porn with some horror, some said it was a slasher B movie. Some said decent acting and a good gore fest.It was all of the above, though I'd say less porn, there are some nude/sex scenes but they're really not the heart of the movie. The gore is well done, the acting is very good I think, and the overall slasher aspect is reasonable, though it could have been a little more creative.Saying all of that none of it is what I'll remember this movie for. What really struck me in this movie was the portrayal of age and how it affects people and their relationships, I actually felt really sad for some of the characters in this movie, and that isn't usually how I'd expect to feel watching a slasher. It really did feel like the writers, directors,. And actors were trying to remind us of something whilst also making a decent slasher. I think it's to value our youth, and our lives as much as we can. I don't want to say much more as I don't want to spoil the movie. Needless to say if you're looking for a decent movie to check out I'd recommend giving this a go. It will entertain you and also make you think a little about the problems others have."
"X","aidanratesmovies","2 April 2022",610,"An interesting slow burn, but without enough to make it stand against the countless other slasher films, X is a fine film and another tribute to the iconic genre that made horror so popular in the first place. Granted, I do enjoy myself a slasher film from time to time- I'm quite fond of films like Nightmare on Elm Street and My Bloody Valentine, but where X faults among the others is through using a rather familiar formula without any true unique purpose. Throughout the film the characters often talk about an X factor, something that makes Mia Goth's character special and starworthy- but unlike its mentionings- this film just doesn't have that. The acting is really good, I love the underrated Mia Goth as always- as well as Brittany Snow, Martin Henderson, and even Kid Cudi did a rather impressive job. The cinematography is fantastic and perfectly fits the amitpshere and tone the film is going for. The music is enjoyable and tense, and its pacing can be a bit slow at times, but does allow for an interesting point of view. Its main problem lies solely in its script, which revolves largely around a smut film production- but takes too many elements and formulaic tendencies from other horror films like Evil Dead, Friday the 13th, The Visit and most obviously Texas Chainsaw Massacre to really stand out on its own and become its own thing. In the end, its not a bad watch, I wouldn't watch it again, but I certainly didn't mind watching it. It isn't the most memorable, but I certainly don't have any disdain for it. It just could have been more, especially given the talent involved, but ironically it settled for less.My Rating: 5.8/10."
"X","fpcholcomb","29 November 2023",210,"I love the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I love it for its idiosyncrasies, its low budget ingenuity, its colorful villains, its charming flaws. That being said, I would not describe the Texas Chainsaw Massacre as high art. It is effectively schlock, good schlock, but schlock none the less. Schlock works when it is fun and creative, when it engages the viewer in its excesses. Schlock can, however, be elevated by a dedicated artist's vision, and that is what X attempts to do. It takes an established style and plot structure from B-movie horror of the past, now nostalgic in its appeal, and attempts to do three things, pay homage to those classics, elevate the material through artistic directing techniques not contemplated by the older films, and to talk about societies relationship to sex, youth, and religion in broad strokes. On all three accounts X is a failure.The film is not wholly without charm. Mia Goth is fantastic as the lead and the rest of the performances are solid. There are some beautiful shots, and the director has the courage to take some real chances with how he presents the intentionally textbook material. That is where my praise ends.The heart of the film is disappointing. Beautiful shots are ruined by the films tedious attempts to foreshadow its overbearing message. A perfect example is when Mia Goth's character, alone, goes for a swim in some stagnant water that is serene, yet ominous. Up to this point the film has been cultivating a relatively tense atmosphere through uncomfortable interactions with an elderly couple who owns the property where the rest of the characters are trying to surreptitiously film a porno. The scene didn't need blatant danger to feel creepy, but it instead elects to add a crocodile slowly following the main character bluntly foreshadowing danger in an incredibly cheap and contrived way. She is prey, and yet any audience member already knows that. They know X is a horror film. They know the old couple is evil because they are put in so much makeup and prosthetics that they hardly look human. The film is not clever when it moves slowly and blatantly shouts what it is attempting to do.Combined with the otherwise banal plot it's telegraphed unfolding, X also has much to say about sex, religion, and personhood, but it is so shallow in its interpretations of these concepts. In trying to be deep in comes across as shallow.Spoiler ahead, but the elderly woman's bloodlust is essentially fueled by her inability to feel desirable since she has aged. Her husband can no longer play the part of her romantic lover as the way she needs. She longs for the youth that the other characters have, and all the sexual and personal freedom it gives. The gang, on the other hand, are young and cocky and seek to leverage their youth to gain wealth and fame. They are vain people who are pretending to have deeper connection than they actually have (one girl talks about faking her interest during scenes, while the head honcho talks about all women being the same, etc., the film is never subtle). Mia Goth's character, while the softest spoken, still harps about how she wants to be successful above all else, like she deserves the fame she believes appearing in pornography will bring.The commentary here completely lacks nuance. These people don't inspire sympathy, but they don't deserve their fate. The film seems to critique old conservative forms of sex, yet the main thrust of the film is that making a porno and youthful hubris gets many people killed. The main character leaves the carnage at the end, but rather than relief at a quick getaway (a la Texas Chainsaw Massacre) she feels like John Wayne esq hero leaving victorious, which made little sense. To make matters worse the kills are boring. I found the first murder unbearably artsy in a way that felt unearned, and the rest were total duds, with one possible exception. The film wants to make art of gruesome murders, but also kills a lot of people in very anticlimactic and visually unappealing ways (quick gunshots, underwater and unseen deaths).Maybe some people will be taken with the shot composition and retro feel combined with a modern shooting style, but in my opinion a film needs a lot more than vapid exploration of themes along with a nostalgic style to be interesting or entertaining.X's ultimate sin is it lacked the charm of the slashers of the past, and in trying to innovate within the genre completely missed the point of it."

It does take some unusual turns, but for me that only added to just how much the film stood on it's own. It certainly feels like a fresh entry into the slasher genre, something the genre needs. Ti West continues to make a name for himself as someone to watch out for. Have fun with this sexy, bloody good time."
"X","HorrorEnjoyer","26 May 2022",110,"After reading the plot, I expected to see a generic slasher movie, however, what I got was a boring artsy-wannabe flick, which takes itself way too seriously and ends up being devoid of soul or any kind of entertainment.After 1 HOUR of extremely slow and tedious build-up you get presented by the most pathetic horror movie villains I have seen in my entire life. Scree-writer must have a serious phobia of frail old people, because that's the only way you'll find any kind of thrills in this movie.With a pretentious façade, one might think that such a movie would at least be devoid of clichés, but they are all there - loud sound jump scares, extremely dumb victims, completely unrealistic kills, which you see coming a mile away, and one of the most pathetic endings to the slasher movie ever.Just go rewatch Texas Chainsaw Massacre - both originals and remakes are a million times more entertaining than this boring mess."
"X","Top_Dawg_Critic","23 January 2023",910,"They don't make em like this anymore. Good old-school slasher-horror flicks from the 70's and 80's. Writer, producer, director and editor Ti West was stellar in every department in this exceptionally well put together film. The cinematography was top shelf - all genres considered, and his directing was just as great. Even the score and soundtrack was the best I've heard in a very long time. All casting and performances were excellent, especially the lovely Jenna Ortega, and Mia Goth in her dual roles as Maxine Minx and granny Pearl. Kid Cudi also had some good fun being cast as Jackson Hole. The gore, prosthetics and special effects were on point. There were even some surprisingly unexpected jump-scares where you wouldn't expect them - all due to simplistic yet creative filmmaking techniques. The writing had a nice flow to it with continuity and decent pacing, so the 105 min runtime passed by comfortably. There really isn't much to negatively critique in this little gem, except I wished for more narrative and sub-plots. It's a must-see if you're a fan of this genre, and a well deserved 9/10 from me."
"X","dan_da_man-60288","7 May 2023",110,"It's a trope that slashers have some aspect of sex in them, sure, but the entire first hour of this pos is just the result of a horny director who wanteed to make porn but also wants to pretend they're making a legit movie to their friends. So they filmed bad porn and then tacked 40 mins of slasher on the end.A solid hour of just ""look she STILL has her tits out"" and ""let's have another group discussion about the morals of dating a porn star,"" followed by a kill scene set to the most cliched song to ever be in a kill scene.I get that there's some stupid nonsensical lookalike story going on with a girl and the old woman, but every time she moves in tense moments and a big rubber mask is bending in unnatural ways it pulls you right out of the immersion.The pacing is all over the place. Some scenes just go on for way too long for basically no additional payoff. Like yes, the killer is obviously emotional, but I got that from the first 10 stabs, and the next 20 just had me waiting for it to be over. Some scenes are way too blunt, having a person wander into an area and get killed in about 1 min flat.There's very little imagination in the kill scenes, which may have flown in the decade it's set, but we've had decades of slashers and can expect a bit more these days than someone blatantly holding a knife behind their back stabbing someone. I really hope nobody lost any sleep trying to write that scene."
"X","westy_captain","2 October 2022",610,"Not really a jump scare sort of deal and like if you read the little description about the movie it has all the spoilers in it already.First point, I thought it was really funny when kid Cudi was standing in the door frame and you could only see his shadowSecondly For a movie about making a porno, there were adequate number boobs shown.And the prosthetics used to make the main actor look older we're great. In all worth a watch like most things above 5 starsLittle note to IMDB -Not only do I not want to write a 500 word essay I also would not like reading other peoples 500 word essays. Make it like 200 easy."
"X","preppy-3","31 March 2022",710,"In 1979 a bunch of young filmmakers set out to rural Teaxas to film a porno film. They rent a cabin in the middle of nowhere from an old guy. They begin filming but the old guy and his wife have other plans. Soon the young people are fighting for their lives.This is a very odd film. It's a solid hour before any horror kicks in but when it does it's VERY bloody, gruesome and pretty sick. However it is well-done, the acting is good and there is plenty of female and male frontal nudity. Also I love how the opening and closing credits look like they came off an old porno flick! Worth a look but the buildup to the blood and guts is kind of slow."
"X","pietclausen","14 April 2022",110,"Instead of getting a horror movie of the 70's, you watch a group of junkies going to make a porn movie on a farm, which turns out to be nothing but a long drawn out build-up, before they get wiped out but one. Some people call it a slow burner, but they're wrong, it doesn't even get lit."
"X","tlarraya","30 April 2022",210,"The movie is ok. The acting is very good. But the old couple don´t seem believable. I don´t get all the raving reviews. I wish I had watched something else."
"X","greengrace-28359","30 December 2023",210,"It's so sad to see amazing films come out of A24, and then have to rate them next to this... whatever this is.To say this film was boring is an understatement. This film DRAGGED the entire way through. The timing of the kills was even off. Found myself skipping through the intense scenes because you can only stab someone so many times before it looses its shock value.There is a lack of plot this entire movie other than old people wanting to yoink each other, but they are too old so they need some young people to do it for them?It's also a highly unbelievable film as they have the old couple killing couples in their 20's/30's in very mobile ways but they are introduced being very pitiful and Ill.Wanted to see why ""Pearl"" is rated so highly and this was barley talked about. Guess we know why now."
"X","Chi-C-Dawg","24 March 2022",510,"I can't with movies full of characters that just walk around without any instinct doing the absolute dumbest things they could possibly choose before they're murdered. It's literally the whole movie. The 'action and gore' is actually pretty tame. The sex is explicit. The characters are idiots."
"X","Xstal","14 April 2022",410,"... there'd be plenty of flesh and gore and comical carnage to see, with disfigured torsos, extreme loss of blood flow, and attempts to escape but not being able to quite flee.... and it would be better than this."
"X","vango_al","1 May 2022",110,"People rating this 9 and 10. Did we watch the same movie? Its a hilariously bad slasher. Just the premise of it is enough to stay away from it. 6 adults get terrorized and murdered by a couple 90 year olds that can barely move. Yeah you read that right. Imagine not knocking out a 90 year old that moves with the speed of a turtle. Waste of time."
"X","gc-17365","14 April 2022",110,"An hour into the movie before anything of note happens.Then the next 40 minutes where a little bit happensLacklustre story using all the old horror tropes whilst actually making them worseThe guy cannot do horror stories, aspires to be Wes Craven but ends up more like Wesley Crusher.I wonder how much of the advertising budget was spent on paying people to leave glowing reviews."
