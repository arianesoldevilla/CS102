"Marvels","Sleepin_Dragon","10 November 2023",410,"Carol Danvers is attempting to save the universe, but her incredible powers become entangled with those of Kamala Khan and Monica Rambeau, they must unite to save the world.Ouch, what can you say, this is surely one of Marvel's lowest points, I honestly don't know who the target audience is, or who this is going to appeal to, young teens only maybe? Anyhow, this was an absolute mess.The writing was clearly problematic, it doesn't gel, it is genuinely all over the place. I do very much wonder if huge sections of this film cut? It can be the only answer, it just doesn't flow at all, and that short run time...Special effects, some were pretty good, some were poor, I just wish there was a greater focus on plot, it just seemed like 100 minutes of CGI, noise and random events.Brie Larson, I'm not sure about you, but to me she looked totally disinterested and bored by the whole thing, what I didn't see, was someone committed to the role. I thought Samuel Jackson was rather good, but again poorly served by the script.It didn't look great from the trailers, and in reality, it's another clunker from Marvel Studios.4/10."
"Marvels","judywalker2","14 December 2023",510,"Went to see this movie with my 17- and 11-year-old granddaughters. One is a Ms. Marvel fan and the other is now. For me I was hoping for something that children and adults could enjoy. But, no only kids will enjoy this silly mess.I enjoyed the Captain Marvel movie and thought the criticism was not warranted. I also loved Wanda Vision and the introduction of Monica Rambeau and I was hoping for at least a good continuation of her story. I didn't watch Ms. Marvel because I'm not a teen and I knew it wasn't for me; and after watching her parts in this movie I'm glad I stuck to that.All three actresses are good and of course Samuel L in always a pleasure to see, but none of the other characters including the so-called villain were the least bit interesting. Most of the scenes were just downright silly. I hope they continue Monica's story with better writing and I wish Marvel would stop being silly and go back to making movies for adults and kids."
"Marvels","isaacsundaralingam","11 November 2023",310,"The MCU has absolutely overstayed its welcome. Post Avengers Endgame, these projects have been feeling more and more like content than cinema (except the rare surprises like GOTG 3). Superhero fatigue, they call it and this movie does practically nothing but to amp it up to 11.You watch the trailer, you know what happens. You bet on originality, you end up homeless. There's nothing new for me to say that I haven't already said about any of the other MCU content as of late. It's so generic that I'm confident a year from now, no one would remember this movie even existed. With every new MCU project, the jokes-per-minute ratio keeps getting worse, the villains are a writer's version of a stock photograph (I can't even remember the villain's name in this movie and it hasn't even been a day since I watched it), the CGI is so out there you can almost see the CGI artists' tears on screen, and it's getting more and more difficult to tell each MCU project apart cos they're all just the same.The only few positives I can identify here are actresses Iman Vellani and Brie Larson (Larson, who seems much more relaxed and settled into her superhero boots), and maybe the flashy action sequences. Otherwise, there's nothing here to watch, nothing here to experience and nothing here to enjoy. What a shame."
"Marvels","MrDHWong","9 November 2023",410,"""The Marvels"" is the sequel to 2019's ""Captain Marvel"", a continuation of the Disney+ series ""Ms. Marvel"", and the 33rd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris, and Iman Vellani, it represents a painful look at the downward spiral the MCU has found itself caught in since the end of Phase 3.Sometime after the events of ""Captain Marvel"", Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) has unintentionally started a civil war among the alien race known as the Kree. The leader of the Kree, Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton), soon finds one half of the Quantum Bands and later seeks out the other half, which is in the possession of Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel (Iman Vellani). At the request of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Carol teams up with Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) to negotiate peace among the Kree, but as the two investigate a wormhole in outer space, Monica, Carol, and Kamala start mysteriously switching powers with one another. Realising something is amiss, the trio are forced to work together to figure out what is causing this strange phenomena and hopefully put a stop to both Dar-Benn and the warring Kree.It's becoming harder and harder to call myself fan of the MCU, given the array of serviceable to terrible projects they have been churning out lately. To be fair though, it is a tall order to top something as ambitious as the culmination of over ten years worth of universe building after both ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and ""Avengers: Endgame"" pulled it off so effectively years ago. For the longest time, I have been willing to defend the post-Endgame MCU for trying different things, as I was under the impression that all of this would be leading to exciting new projects on the horizon. However, after sitting through ""The Marvels"", I can say with a hint of heartbreak that practically all of my optimism for the MCU's future has all but disappeared, as it contains next to nothing worth defending from a creative standpoint.Perhaps the best way to describe my viewing experience with this film would be ""apathetic"", because at no point does it ever feel like anything important is at stake. This is mainly due to either our three heroes being too overpowered or there not being enough information provided about the ones who need saving. Whenever a horde of enemies are swarming the trio, we watch as the three of them effortlessly take them out without even breaking a sweat. Action-packed moments like these that once elicited excitement have now been reduced to a series of bland fistfights and generic CGI blasts that have all been done before in better MCU films.We see Carol Danvers quickly blast everyone away with her energy beams and block punches with her hands, never once showing any signs that she is in real danger. Her accomplice Monica Rambeau does pretty much the same thing, only with less time on screen. Even Kamala Khan, who is the biggest fish-out-of-water in this situation, has no major trouble dealing with foes coming at her from every angle, always using her half of the Quantum Band to her advantage. How is it possible to keep the audience on their toes if the enemy forces are so inefficient that even an inexperienced child can wipe the floor with them this easily? On that note, it also doesn't help that none of these three heroes appear to have any physical weaknesses or personal insecurities holding them back, which causes all of the tension to evaporate instantly.In addition to this, we are barely shown anything interesting about the Kree that will keep the audience invested in their role in the story. As far as the film is concerned, they are nothing more than a stock species of extraterrestrials that are causing problems simply because the plot demands it. The original ""Captain Marvel"" film established that the Kree were the ones who inadvertently gave Carol her powers and took her in among them. Yet, this film never reminds the audience of that, instead opting to throw them right into the thick of the conflict without any important context. As a result, I just did not care at all about what happened to any of these people.It's also worth mentioning that this film is rife with obvious re-edits and tonal inconsistencies. One scene where this is most evident is where Carol Danvers is opening up to both Rambeau and Khan about her relationship with the Kree. What could have been a good method of showcasing Danvers's humanity is instead brushed aside for something completely unrelated after less than two minutes. I couldn't help but assume that this scene was supposed to go on much longer but was cut in post production for whatever reason. To add insult to injury, the scene is then immediately followed by a strange attempt at comic relief which fails to raise even a single laugh. Although Marvel films are known for their blending of comedy with drama, a moment like this felt like a rather tacky addition to the film that only hampers the already poor narrative structure. Worse still, there are other similar occurrences like this throughout the rest of the story.One of the biggest problems with the original ""Captain Marvel"" film was how weakly written the title character was, with her lack of likeable character traits and overly serious demeanour being a major reason why she is not viewed favourably by fans. You'd expect the filmmakers to remedy this problem for the sequel, but you would be wrong. I'm not sure whether it's Brie Larson's underwhelming performance or just plain old bad writing but I have never once felt any fondness for Carol Danvers as a person. As mentioned above, she efficiently fights her way through many bad guys with no issue whatsoever, never once showing any emotional weakness or other potential vulnerabilities. Because of this, Carol Danvers never feels like a real person, being nothing more than a one-dimensional superhero that is practically impossible for anybody to identify with. Her character has not changed or grown since the first film, and it looks like she won't be doing so anytime soon.I keep trying to remind myself of Monica Rambeau's contribution to the story but nothing memorable ever comes to mind without doing some kind of online research. Like Brie Larson, there is nothing especially remarkable about Teyonah Parris's performance, as her character is as bland as she comes. Though it is established that Rambeau looked up to Carol Danvers as a child, her role in this story is nothing more than playing second fiddle to an already dull lead protagonist. Yes, Rambeau is very strong and yes, she is more than capable of taking care of herself in a fight, but beyond that what else does she offer? Most of the time she just goes along with Danvers's orders without ever questioning her or giving her personal opinions, making her nothing more than a blind follower. I was hoping to have seen some kind of opposing dynamic between Danvers and Rambeau, as that would have given their characters an important amount of depth the distinguish the two from one another. No such luck I'm afraid.The only character I sort of cared about was Kamala Khan, whose childlike naiveté made her the most relatable of the three leads. In her feature film debut, Iman Vellani does carry over many of Khan's human traits from the Disney+ series ""Ms. Marvel"", being that she's still young and coming to terms with mastering her powers. Unfortunately, she does not achieve this through the character herself, but rather due to how woefully underwritten her two co-stars are in comparison. I wanted to see the three as kindred spirits, fighting as trio but standing out as individuals. Instead, all we get are two dull, stoic, overpowered adults and a young kid working together for no other reason than because the writers said so.As depressing as it sounds, the once mighty MCU is showing no signs of improvement as ""The Marvels"" just may be the worst film in the series so far. There simply isn't enough reason to justify its existence outside of some kind of contractual obligation by the higher ups at Disney, and I fully respect many people's decision to skip it altogether. At this point, I seriously doubt the MCU can ever return to its former glory, as this film is set to become the series' biggest box office bomb to date. I can only hope in vain that Disney will learn an important lesson from this film's failure, but knowing their track record that seems unlikely.I rate it 4/10."
"Marvels","danieljfarthing","9 January 2024",110,"2019's ""Captain Marvel"" wasn't too bad, for a superhero movie, but its sequel ""The Marvels"" is an unmitigated stinking disaster - the WORST Marvel movie to date (which is saying something). Set a decade or two after the original, Brie Larson (via Samuel L Jackson) teams somewhat inadvertently with Teyonah Parris & Iman Vellani (awful) to save Gary Lewis' people (what happened to previous leader Ben Mendelsohn?!) from evil Zawe Ashton. Director Nia DaCosta (who also co-wrote this tripe with Megan McDonnell & Elissa Karasik) creates a headache inducing, fast (as if bizarrely sped up), frantic, thoroughly annoying, tiresome piece of garbage. Absolutely dreadful."
"Marvels","altugozhan","12 November 2023",210,"I just want to know who is responsible for MCUs phase 4 and how he or she can still be employedThere are 0(zero) good movies and only 1 or 2 tv shows that are watchable over a total of 20 productions and this is one of the bottom ranked ones. Marvel did a fantastic job over the decade, earned trust of fans besides billions of dollars and they are wasting it like there is no tomorrow.I don't know how a franchise can change so drastically from hero to zero.I have watched every marvel movie out there and this is equally as bad as she-hulk.Story is definitely boring, protagonists are boring, antagonist is boring, action is boring, battles are boring, some scenes are absurd and ridiculous.I have absolutely nothing good to say about this movie. Don't waste your money or your time.Looks like the movie is only made to make money in India."
"Marvels","ThereelscoopwithKK","10 November 2023",110,"This second installment makes the original Captain Marvel look like a cinematic masterpiece... Nothing about this movie works. Although Brie Larson's acting has improved over the years it feels like she doesn't want to be there for this at all. Further, when you break it down, there is really no story at all happening. In fact, the solution to the entire problem is so extremely simple and solvable that you really wonder why there was a conflict in the first place. So much of everything is unexplained and eventually you stop trying to figure it out because you eventually lose all interest . Samuel L Jackson's character , Nick Fury, is hardly even a shell of his former self and is essentially now demoted to comedic relief.The scenes don't really mesh together at all. None of them are really necessary to advancing a plot and all feature the same repeated choreographic battle. The villain lacks any real charisma and is only provided a very brief backstory. Overall she never feels like too much of a threat.There's one part in particular that I think is absolutely a candidate for worst sequence of 2023. Without spoiling it , it is essentially a planet that looks like a cheap rip off of the Wizard of Oz. It just captures all of the problems with this movie into one scene. There's been a lot of less than stellar work from Marvel since endgame, but this is reaching new depths.I'm not even going to get started on the cats scene with the theme song....Please Loki, reset the entire timeline."
"Marvels","Avwillfan89","23 December 2023",110,"This film is somehow way more depressing and worse than Ant Man Quantumania. We honestly thought Eternals was bad, but that was only the beginning. It was only going to go downhill from there.Watching this movie felt like watching a beloved friend in a coma fighting for her life. It was sad, frustrating and ultimately hopeless. So much potential squandered right before our very eyes.Much has been said about the Girl Power aspect of this story, but it doesn't mean jack when the characters are so thinly written. After the big character tension build up between Carol and Monica, with the latter resenting her for not coming back, their fractures mend themselves very quickly. There is no chemistry between the the two at all.The villain is Bland with a capitol B, and highly forgettable.Nick Fury is actually pathetic in this movie. He doesn't at all act like the Fury we know and love. He was more in character in Far From Home when Talos was impersonating him!I don't think I've ever had this much of a bad experience with a film since Cats. And it is telling that there actually features a ludicrous scene involving baby flerkens and the song Memory.What the actual hell, Marvel?The only good thing is that it is mercifully short, and Iman Vellani does seem to be enjoying herself in the role.Once a great studio, brought crumbling down on itself. If I could give it zero stars, I would."
"Marvels","chenp-54708","10 November 2023",210,"Marvel movies really have fallen apart haven't they? This is definitely one of the worst Marvels movie I have seen out of all the Marvel movies I had watched. There really isn't too much to say about the movie because ""The Marvels"" is pretty much like almost every single Marvel movie but the writing, humor, direction, and performances are pretty much all over the place. Director Nia DaCosta has made ""Little Woods"" which I liked but her direction here is pretty bad and goes all over the place.The special effects are kind of rough on the edges, the actions and thrills were just okay and the performances, despite a pretty good cast, they aren't very good. Brie Larson is an actress I like but unfortunately her performance felt weak and lacking. The other performances as well including the child performances. The story isn't interesting as the writing is pretty bland and none of the characters were interesting. With a short runtime, the movie surprisingly was really boring.I do like superhero movies but it seems this one really just sucked. Overall, it's bad."
"Marvels","kevin_robbins","12 November 2023",310,"My wife and I recently caught Marvel's (2023) in theaters. The plot revolves around Captain Marvel's mistake in choosing sides during a battle, disrupting the cosmic balance. Two young ladies gain powers in the process, and Captain Marvel must collaborate with them to rectify her error and restore equilibrium to the universe.Directed by Nia DaCosta (Candyman) and featuring Brie Larson (Lessons in Chemistry), Teyonah Parris (Dear White People), Iman Vellani (Ms. Marvel), Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction), and Zawe Ashton (Blitz).This film boasts clean and classic Marvel-style characters, cinematography, action scenes, and special effects. However, the plot seems somewhat lackluster, with Captain Marvel possibly appearing more as a villain than a hero. The backstories of the heroes lack sufficient development, making it challenging to form a connection with them. The cat steals the show initially but feels overdone by the end, and even Samuel L. Jackson's wit falls short of expectations.In summary, this superhero movie prioritizes its message over a compelling storyline. While the characters and visuals are in line with Marvel's trademark style, the plot may leave audiences indifferent. The lack of character depth and an engaging storyline earns this film a 3/10, making it a skip-worthy experience."
"Marvels","SHU_Movies","10 November 2023",310,"Going from the Loki Series Finale this morning to The Marvels this evening was (for lack of a better word) bonkers! The finale was perfect, and a beautiful ending to the show, while The Marvels is a complete mess. It's honestly given me whiplashThe Marvels is just an all-around bad movie. The script is awful and the story is super rushed and poorly executed, which both have an impact on how well the characters (and in-turn the actors) come-across on-screenThe action and humour are kind of alright, and the VFX are definitely better than anything we've seen in an MCU project since Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness (with the obvious exceptions of Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 and Loki Season 2), but that still doesn't exactly make it look greatThis movie is just painful to watch at points! Early on, it has some really fun moments, and felt like it could have actually been somewhat entertaining, but that feeling vanished as soon as it came. It's barley better than Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania, so you can do with that information what you will."
"Marvels","NanoFrog","16 January 2024",110,"So Stan Lee passes away and we get Disney now in full control of Marvel stories...and boy is there a difference. I could not finish watching this really bad film, it is just junk from scene to scene. The cast, I feel so sorry for them because the cast is a fine group for the most part...but the story, the effects, the directing are all jumbled up into a real mess. The premise is interesting but they have no idea what to do with it. I have never been a fan of Disney, maybe when I was 10 years old, back in the early 60s, but this is not at all Walt Disney. This is Disney INC and a massive number of talentless paperwork and book-keepers make their films these days. This is just junk slammed together by people who have no idea how to tell a story or stage intelligent effects. This film is not a Turkey, it is, in fact, just garbage. RIP MArvel."
"Marvels","OnlyAtJMart","12 November 2023",410,"Anyone who heard the news about this project knows that the production was a nightmare, and it shows in the final product here. It's like they couldn't figure out what direction to go, so they made 4 versions, and blended them together. Which would explain the high budget, the 5 delays, and the reshoots. Kamala's character was probably the best part of the movie. I promise you, the script did her no favors, but she stood out. Her acting was in line with her character. This was probably an exciting opportunity for her, and she wasn't going to let a bad script, and production problems stop her from giving a great effort. However, the story, the dialogue, the musical gimmick, the weak villain. It just didn't work. I don't think the blame lies solely with the actors, or even the director, who did lack the experience for helming a movie with a budget this size. I think Disney interfered heavily with the production, which almost always yields bad results. I think it was doomed to fail. They put so much pressure on this being successful, they forgot to make it coherent, unique, or interesting."
"Marvels","mildlyintrusive","13 November 2023",210,"Once in a while I tend to go to my local theater to check out something new, maybe a new release or a re-run of a movie. Today, I stumbled upon The Marvels, I thought ""Hey, I haven't been going to the theater this month that often, maybe I should try this out?"" And well, it seems that I'd made the wrong decision. The Marvels follows the titular Marvels trying to stop an evil Kree with one disadvantage however, every time they use their powers, it's Freaky Friday.Maybe its because of the very troubled production but everything just feels like an amalgamation of three separate movies, its like a ADHD experience. The movie does NOT take itself seriously at all, and as a result, it makes me hard to care for literally everything! Its like a circus act masquerading as a movie, it doesn't work! There were moments where characters were in danger and they start joking about it every opportunity they get. To add insult to injury was the treatment of the character of Nick Fury, who feels like a completely different character altogether, cracking lame after lame jokes every single time! Special effects were decent, but considering the massive 271M+ budget I wished they could've at least cared about the plot and flesh out some if the characters and their motivations instead of relying on action scene after action scene, it gets tiring after a while you know?Brie Larson herself looks tired and forced in this movie, her character also being this girl-boss who can sweep through enemies in this movie, no weaknesses and no vulnerabilities. It all feels so one-dimensional, it tries to be like a 80s action star with the likes of Arnold and co. But fails because they lack charisma and charm. Because of this I found it impossible to relate to her in any sense of way. Monica Rambeau wasn't trying her best here, and there is no opposing dynamic between the two to the point where I found her virtually indistinguishable from Mrs. Danvers herself. However I do commend Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan, whose child-like personality I was comfortable with and is the standout between the three leads but suffers from being very underwritten and the villain is a copy-and-paste from dozens we've seen before.Overall, a messy and disjointed movie with not much to offer rather than annoying, dreadful humor and some few flashy action scenes. It certainly feels like homework for the MCU as it struggles to keep a hook in something after the Infinity Saga. Skip this one and play with your action figures instead, Im sure it'll be better than this."
"Marvels","critic-97-417657","4 February 2024",810,"The movie was somewhat ridiculous, but I found myself giggling throughout it. It was actually quite fun. There were a lot of really charming things about this movie, and while the storyline lacked any real tension, I didn't really care. It was mostly about the character development, and the relationships between the three main characters. Overall, I just found it really fun and just didn't take it very seriously. In a lot of ways, it is a set up for the rest of the series, and is definitely not a standalone movie. And the post credit scene, amazing. Ties in a lot of potential for what they are going to be doing in this franchise."
"Marvels","The-Sarkologist","7 February 2024",710,"Well, I guess someone was right when they said that one of the big problems with this film was that you had to like watch 8 other films and 3 series to sort of understand what was going on. Mind you, I have actually done just that, but even then with the amount of time that had passed since I watched the other things it was still a little tricky understanding what was happening.Mind you, I did actually quite like the film. Like the scenes where they were switching places whenever they used their powers together, and also the big bad in the film, that was in part trying to save her people, but also attempting to punish Captain Marvel for what she had done to her people. Yeah, as it turned out, when she destroyed the great intelligence it sent the Kree into a massive civil war which basically destroyed their planet.So, if you had seen Miss Marvel, you will know that she has a thing for Captain Marvel, and of course it was always going to be a thing that she was eventually going to be involved in a team up. Also, there were some hints at the end that suggested that there was going to be another team-up film, though apparently that will still be some way off (and the problem will be that, no doubt, when they get around to it, all of them will be too old to be members of a possible Young Avengers - kids do grow up a little too fast).Yeah, I thought that this film was pretty good, though I have to agree that the problem is that you do need to catch up to speed to understand what is going on. Oh, it also seemed that it felt that it was a bit over the place, no doubt because they wanted to make the film shorter than a lot of the others. Still, it's good, especially if you are up to date on the films."
"Marvels","cherold","30 January 2024",710,"After the bad reviews, and considering how many bad superhero movies have come out lately, I would have skipped this one if the trailer didn't look like so much fun. Fortunately, the movie fulfills the trailer's promiseIn the movie, three superheroes with related powers find themselves suddenly swapping places with one another. The proves to be a good gimmick for both action and comedy, as the three keep finding themselves in one another's battles. Eventually, they master the situation in order to take down a very angry villain with an unusually sympathetic backstory.The movie leans heavily - and for the most part successfully - into the comedy. A big chunk of this is fueled by the teenage Captain Marvel fangirl Ms. Marvel, who is from a TV series I found too pre-teen-oriented to enjoy. Ms. Marvel's an annoying character but for the most part I found her amusing in this.There's also a funny gag with alien cats.While I enjoyed this movie, I have to admit its a bit of an unfocussed mess. There are a lot of elements just tossed in, like a whole thing with Marvel #3, Monica, dealing with her abandonment issues. These occasional ""emotional"" moments don't much interest me.Anyway, a lot of people hate this, but if you like the trailer, I'd say chance the movie (I did not take a chance on the last Aquaman movie because unlike The Marvels, the trailer looked just as bad as people said the movie was.Going against the current, I say if you want a bunch of comedy and some fun action then you should watch this one."
"Marvels","drawlife","8 November 2023",510,"THE MARVELS is here and it's a mashed up film that is totally all over the place. It feels as if this film was edited and chopped into pieces during post and it shows.Couple things I enjoyed, I did like seeing Carol Danvers and Monica Rambeau resolve and acknowledge their relationship, but due to the nature of their characters being straight arrows, it allows Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan to be the audience just as Tom Holland's Peter Parker was in CIVIL WAR. I did not particularly enjoy the MS. MARVEL series, but I can see her being the shoutout for many.I think the script just touched on the surface of Brie Larson's Captain Marvel herself, so diving into her more is a plus, however the story did her no favors once again and I did feel like she was given like four or five pieces of direction to portray her character compared to the more one-note performance in the first film. Teyonah Parris is commendable. She was the more science-y of the trio.Samuel L. Jackson just feels inconsistent especially after SECRET INVASION. Feels like this Nick Fury is a variant. He's simply passing through in this film.Another thing I liked was the incursions (also briefly touched on in DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS). We all complained about the lack of planting seeds for the future leading into KANG DYNASTY and SECRET WARS. Finally, this film it at least preps and teases what's to come down the line.The MCU's villain problem is a long known fact, but here it only cements their problem even further. Now I'm a fan of Lee Pace's over the top performance as Ronan, but Dar-Benn played by Zawe Ashton is literally a copy and paste of Ronan, but female. Nothing new about it. Definitely up there as one of the worst villains in the MCU.The power swaps were kinda cool so I can give it that. Nia DaCosta does a good job executing the fight scenes, but again as one should expect, VFX is meh. Now if you cringed during the musical note duel between the two Doctor Strange, then wait till you see one segment of the film where it feels like a misplaced musical. Lots of quirky and annoying humor like one should expect in an MCU film.The Skrulls are in the film and as a fan we always think we can write the better film after watching it, but I just DO NOT understand why this sequel couldn't have been SECRET INVASION(one of the worst MCU Disney+ shows). SECRET INVASION honestly should have been an Avengers film or at the very least a Captain Marvel sequel co-starring some Avengers, kinda like CIVIL WAR. I personally feel like that dilemma could have furthered Captain Marvel's development due to her involvement with them and how she's equally to blame for not helping them out when she and Fury promised to find them a home. But instead she's stuck with this material.The mid-credit scene is arguably the best part. Once again teasing things to come. It's stuff that like that, that will maybe still garner interest in the MCU despite its current fall from grace. The end-credit scene is alright. Not particularly jazzed about that promise down the line.On that note, the recent Variety article published about Marvel Studios talked about their behind the scenes trouble. It was said that Kevin Feige and his creative committee partook in their yearly Palm Springs retreat to regroup and refocus, so here's hoping to next year being more consistent with quality. Seemed like he was spread too thin with the mandate to have more quantity than quality.THE MARVELS is a season 1.5 for MS. MARVEL and a CAPTAIN MARVEL sequel that we never saw due to the flashbacks and exposition to explain things. And let's be clear, at this point everything feels like homework. That was going to be inevitable moving forward after INFINITY WAR and ENDGAMGE, but especially when Disney+ was announced making Kevin Feige spread out too thin. But it only feels like homework because everything that has been released is below the standard of what Marvel set up for us.So to sum it up, while I did find it slightly more appealing than the first CAPTAIN MARVEL and QUANTUMANIA, that isn't saying much. Low expectations definitely helped. Is THE MARVELS one of the worst? No, but it definitely belongs way down below the list.5/10."
"Marvels","tibby_23","17 January 2024",410,"By far the worst Marvel movie so far, I am extremely disappointed. After the mess that Thor 4 was, I was hoping that Marvel learned its lesson, but it seems not. I am honestly happy this movie did bad at the box office, that's what you get for ruining such a great character (I loved Cpt. Marvel from the comics).What makes it bad:
Action moves way too fast from one scene to anotherNo character improvement or growth by the end of the movieThings just happen with no storytellingNot serious enough, too childish for my tasteToo many goofy moments (singing, really? We've come this low, Marvel?)End scenes that try to set the context for next movies seem forced and unnecessaryI also found two good things eventually:
I liked the villain and her story, sympathized with her a bitAt least the movie was not long.These writers should never be hired again."
"Marvels","olcare","10 November 2023",410,"Criticizing specific parts of the movie became confusing for me as there were so many details I wanted to change. This film truly disappointed me, especially since my expectations were already low, and falling below them is a bad sign for Marvel. It had a Thor: Love and Thunder vibe, which I also disliked (4/10). I had been excited after watching Loki in the morning, but it was in vain.For me, the unbearable part was the music. After checking the playlists of movies I've watched for a long time, Marvel had by far the worst compositions. The music was exaggerated, drowning out the impact of fight scenes and making them unbearable. It was like overly noisy background music during a break.Another aspect I didn't like was the main villain. I can't believe Marvel fell into the same mistake again. The villain was poorly written, and Zawe Ashton's performance felt forced, appearing awkward in scenes. One major reason for this was the poor portrayal of the Kree Empire in the MCU. Neglecting the significance of the Kree made Supreme look bad. They could have explained the critical situation of the 'Hala' planet in the film's opening with a 30-35 minute sequence, providing context for the desperation of the Kree.Another thing I found absurd was Monica teleporting to a parallel universe. They portrayed the concept of parallel universes like child's play. Especially after watching Loki Season 2 in the morning, her randomly teleporting or getting stuck in another universe seemed too simplistic.Seeing Professor Beast was surprising and pleasing. The X-Men era is beginning, and despite the poor productions, I'm excited. Brie Larson was good again, carrying her character well. The scene with Monica, Kamala, Danvers vs Dar-Benn was good, thankfully without music. However, despite not being a fan of Kamala Khan, her origin is preserved, and it's not bad. But I feel there's a lack of harmony among our main three characters, and I believe it's a script issue, not an actor one.While I like the idea of saving a planet by traveling through different planets, I didn't like the execution at all. Presenting such a serious and contemporary issue as if it's the simplest thing with childlike music seems somewhat unserious to me.However it turns out, this film paved the way for others and served as a stepping stone. Hopefully, with Beast in Deadpool 3, the overall MCU storyline will improve, abandoning mediocrity urgently; otherwise, it will continue to receive poor ratings.Note: I forgot to mention in the review, but Goose is a fantastic character, and I hope we continue to see this adorable cat. The scene with all the cats was genuinely entertaining, one of the enjoyable moments in 4-5 scenes."
"Marvels","alensufli","8 November 2023",210,"Even writing a review is extremely pointless as we all knew what we were expecting months before but here I am. They even themselves admitted it. The film is a huge disappointment. The plot is all over the place. Actions sequences were sometimes good but sometime were so dumb I didn't know where to look, where to pay attention. I like how they tried to catch the old marvel magic. Yes. They tried. But they utterly failed. Feige pulled off ""wait until the post credit scene to get excited cuz the film itself is boring"" trick again. And it wasn't a ""wow"" for me at least. The theatre was silent throughout and after the film. No one even made a giggling sound. Dead silence. Jokes were landing facedown to the ground every time a character made one. That's right. Every character there is comic relief. And I absolutely don't wanna talk about acting."
"Marvels","S3pt3m63r","18 November 2023",NA,"Unfortunately if you haven't got Disney plus and you don't keep to speed with the tv series, then you this movie won't make much sense as it relies on you knowing what's going on in that universe so far, which I'm not up to date with and involves the Miss Marvels characters which haven't been introduced in the movies. Confusing.I had hoped that following Guardians 3 it could've get much worse for the Marvel universe, at least Guardians has Rocket😂It's hard to find any plot to this movie. Carol Danvers (Captain Marvel) does throw a lot of people through the roof but the plot is a quantum entanglement mess. The movie is blissfully short but feels longer as it's so bad and some people walked out of the theatre. I was so pleasantly when it ended.I think it's about to retire the whole Marvel superhero franchise as this phase is going badly."
"Marvels","nscoby93","10 November 2023",210,"I actually had no intention of watching this film in theaters. Originally, I was just going to wait for its home release on Disney Plus, but after recently rewatching WandaVision, I genuinely wanted to see how they would handle Monica Rambeau and see what they would do with her.So I'll mention the positives for this film first...The movie is actually pretty, I really enjoyed the film aesthetically it looked good. This is very surprising to say as recent Marvel projects are tremendous eye sores.The films central characters, Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) and Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani), were surprisingly good. I had fully anticipated to dislike Captain Marvel and Ms Marvel in this film but I surprisingly enjoyed them both which is a big compliment coming from me, and Monica Rambeau is my favorite of the three she was good as I expected and anticipated. All three actresses gave enjoyable performances, and they all worked well together on screen.Then, of course, Samuel Jackson is always great! And the return of everyone's favorite Flerken kitty Goose. She had a great sequence that I refuse to spoil, but it had me dying. Goose saved this film!And well that's it...This film is just bad. Bad writing, bad pacing, bad storytelling. Nothing in this film is properly set up as it rushes through its 1 hour and 45 minute run time. Which is quite frankly fine for me as I genuinely did not want more of this.This movie as a whole is just overwhelmingly safe. It has no stakes, takes no risks, and does nothing. But there is actual enjoyment in its failings. It was so bad that it was good. The amount of eye rolling, face palms, and sighs I gave through this film was astonishing. I gave up on this film within the first 30 minutes, and afterward, that's when the enjoyment began because of how bad it went on to be.Then suddenly, out of nowhere, the film became a musical? Like what is happening? This film is so chaotic and unstructured. It just never stopped.The film had a good mid-credit scene so you know stay for that. Unfortunately, it was spoiled for me, so it didn't hit as hard as it could have. Especially if you're a fan of the actor who originally played the character the scene introduces.But The Marvels was exactly what I anticipated it to be, a below average dump. Which is a shame because they play with some interesting concepts in this film, but they do nothing with them, or they are just poorly handled. I can at least say I didn't hate this movie. Unfortunately, I just enjoyed it for all the wrong reasons.IMDb: 3/10

Once you get over its not adding anything or revealing any easter eggs, you can enjoy it for what it is.All three main characters deliver on their role, and it improves on captain marvels solo outing. Sit down take any preconceived ideas you have, remove any anticipation of easter eggs and enjoy it for what it is.Has marvel lost its way, yes.

"Marvels","brentsbulletinboard","11 November 2023",510,"When I first heard the title of this movie, I thought it was about a 1960s girls' singing group. And, frankly, that would have probably made for a better movie. Writer-director Nia DaCosta's third feature outing and the latest in the Marvel Universe paradigm is a wildly inconsistent superhero movie that tries too hard to do too much and doesn't have a script to support it. Too many of its plot elements aren't adequately explained until well into the story, while others aren't explained at all, leaving viewers who aren't comic book laureates wondering what's going on (particularly at film's end). Meanwhile, other narrative aspects frequently appear gimmicky and grow old quickly, such as the introduction of the primary superpower that its three protagonists share, one that almost becomes slapstickish after an all-too-brief while. On top of that, the CGI effects vacillate from one end of the quality spectrum to the other, creating a mix of images that are either startling to look at or stunningly cheesy at best. Add to that a villain that isn't particularly menacing, along with attempts at humor that either succeed brilliantly (cat lovers take note) or fall flat and look incredibly lame (as aficionados of musical theater will undoubtedly attest), all of which further add to the picture's pervasive inconsistency. The inclusion of ample clues for advancing the overarching Marvel Universe storyline continues here, too, furthering a trend that's growing tiresome in the studio's releases, a development akin to the ""Paul is dead"" legacy come to life with every passing picture. Then there's the trio of heroes themselves, who often appear more like they've been plucked from a giddy slumber party flick or a Cyndi Lauper video than taking center stage as seriously empowered champions in an action-adventure offering. All of these failings combine to make this production more of a forgettable placeholder in the Marvel mythology than a standalone feature (not to mention a pale substitute for a sequel to the far-superior film that launched the Captain Marvel franchise in 2019). In short, ""The Marvels"" is as much of a mess as it is a movie, and that's troubling for several reasons. It lends credence to the growing criticism that films like this aren't to be taken seriously. It reinforces the notion that they're cookie-cutter in nature, easily interchangeable with one another. And it raises questions about the career choices of lead actress Brie Larson, who, though quite capable of playing roles like these, is running the risk of becoming type-cast, a troubling prospect for an Academy Award-winning actress who possesses a depth of talent and is handily adept at taking on better and more serious material than this. In the wake of this release, Marvel Studios should take a step back and seriously assess where its future is headed, especially if movies like this are any indication. As pictures like ""Wakanda Forever"" (2022) show, the studio is capable of better work - and it's time to show viewers that."
"Marvels","Sleepin_Dragon","10 November 2023",410,"Carol Danvers is attempting to save the universe, but her incredible powers become entangled with those of Kamala Khan and Monica Rambeau, they must unite to save the world.Ouch, what can you say, this is surely one of Marvel's lowest points, I honestly don't know who the target audience is, or who this is going to appeal to, young teens only maybe? Anyhow, this was an absolute mess.The writing was clearly problematic, it doesn't gel, it is genuinely all over the place. I do very much wonder if huge sections of this film cut? It can be the only answer, it just doesn't flow at all, and that short run time...Special effects, some were pretty good, some were poor, I just wish there was a greater focus on plot, it just seemed like 100 minutes of CGI, noise and random events.Brie Larson, I'm not sure about you, but to me she looked totally disinterested and bored by the whole thing, what I didn't see, was someone committed to the role. I thought Samuel Jackson was rather good, but again poorly served by the script.It didn't look great from the trailers, and in reality, it's another clunker from Marvel Studios.4/10."
"Marvels","judywalker2","14 December 2023",510,"Went to see this movie with my 17- and 11-year-old granddaughters. One is a Ms. Marvel fan and the other is now. For me I was hoping for something that children and adults could enjoy. But, no only kids will enjoy this silly mess.I enjoyed the Captain Marvel movie and thought the criticism was not warranted. I also loved Wanda Vision and the introduction of Monica Rambeau and I was hoping for at least a good continuation of her story. I didn't watch Ms. Marvel because I'm not a teen and I knew it wasn't for me; and after watching her parts in this movie I'm glad I stuck to that.All three actresses are good and of course Samuel L in always a pleasure to see, but none of the other characters including the so-called villain were the least bit interesting. Most of the scenes were just downright silly. I hope they continue Monica's story with better writing and I wish Marvel would stop being silly and go back to making movies for adults and kids."
"Marvels","isaacsundaralingam","11 November 2023",310,"The MCU has absolutely overstayed its welcome. Post Avengers Endgame, these projects have been feeling more and more like content than cinema (except the rare surprises like GOTG 3). Superhero fatigue, they call it and this movie does practically nothing but to amp it up to 11.You watch the trailer, you know what happens. You bet on originality, you end up homeless. There's nothing new for me to say that I haven't already said about any of the other MCU content as of late. It's so generic that I'm confident a year from now, no one would remember this movie even existed. With every new MCU project, the jokes-per-minute ratio keeps getting worse, the villains are a writer's version of a stock photograph (I can't even remember the villain's name in this movie and it hasn't even been a day since I watched it), the CGI is so out there you can almost see the CGI artists' tears on screen, and it's getting more and more difficult to tell each MCU project apart cos they're all just the same.The only few positives I can identify here are actresses Iman Vellani and Brie Larson (Larson, who seems much more relaxed and settled into her superhero boots), and maybe the flashy action sequences. Otherwise, there's nothing here to watch, nothing here to experience and nothing here to enjoy. What a shame."
"Marvels","MrDHWong","9 November 2023",410,"""The Marvels"" is the sequel to 2019's ""Captain Marvel"", a continuation of the Disney+ series ""Ms. Marvel"", and the 33rd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris, and Iman Vellani, it represents a painful look at the downward spiral the MCU has found itself caught in since the end of Phase 3.Sometime after the events of ""Captain Marvel"", Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) has unintentionally started a civil war among the alien race known as the Kree. The leader of the Kree, Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton), soon finds one half of the Quantum Bands and later seeks out the other half, which is in the possession of Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel (Iman Vellani). At the request of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Carol teams up with Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) to negotiate peace among the Kree, but as the two investigate a wormhole in outer space, Monica, Carol, and Kamala start mysteriously switching powers with one another. Realising something is amiss, the trio are forced to work together to figure out what is causing this strange phenomena and hopefully put a stop to both Dar-Benn and the warring Kree.It's becoming harder and harder to call myself fan of the MCU, given the array of serviceable to terrible projects they have been churning out lately. To be fair though, it is a tall order to top something as ambitious as the culmination of over ten years worth of universe building after both ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and ""Avengers: Endgame"" pulled it off so effectively years ago. For the longest time, I have been willing to defend the post-Endgame MCU for trying different things, as I was under the impression that all of this would be leading to exciting new projects on the horizon. However, after sitting through ""The Marvels"", I can say with a hint of heartbreak that practically all of my optimism for the MCU's future has all but disappeared, as it contains next to nothing worth defending from a creative standpoint.Perhaps the best way to describe my viewing experience with this film would be ""apathetic"", because at no point does it ever feel like anything important is at stake. This is mainly due to either our three heroes being too overpowered or there not being enough information provided about the ones who need saving. Whenever a horde of enemies are swarming the trio, we watch as the three of them effortlessly take them out without even breaking a sweat. Action-packed moments like these that once elicited excitement have now been reduced to a series of bland fistfights and generic CGI blasts that have all been done before in better MCU films.We see Carol Danvers quickly blast everyone away with her energy beams and block punches with her hands, never once showing any signs that she is in real danger. Her accomplice Monica Rambeau does pretty much the same thing, only with less time on screen. Even Kamala Khan, who is the biggest fish-out-of-water in this situation, has no major trouble dealing with foes coming at her from every angle, always using her half of the Quantum Band to her advantage. How is it possible to keep the audience on their toes if the enemy forces are so inefficient that even an inexperienced child can wipe the floor with them this easily? On that note, it also doesn't help that none of these three heroes appear to have any physical weaknesses or personal insecurities holding them back, which causes all of the tension to evaporate instantly.In addition to this, we are barely shown anything interesting about the Kree that will keep the audience invested in their role in the story. As far as the film is concerned, they are nothing more than a stock species of extraterrestrials that are causing problems simply because the plot demands it. The original ""Captain Marvel"" film established that the Kree were the ones who inadvertently gave Carol her powers and took her in among them. Yet, this film never reminds the audience of that, instead opting to throw them right into the thick of the conflict without any important context. As a result, I just did not care at all about what happened to any of these people.It's also worth mentioning that this film is rife with obvious re-edits and tonal inconsistencies. One scene where this is most evident is where Carol Danvers is opening up to both Rambeau and Khan about her relationship with the Kree. What could have been a good method of showcasing Danvers's humanity is instead brushed aside for something completely unrelated after less than two minutes. I couldn't help but assume that this scene was supposed to go on much longer but was cut in post production for whatever reason. To add insult to injury, the scene is then immediately followed by a strange attempt at comic relief which fails to raise even a single laugh. Although Marvel films are known for their blending of comedy with drama, a moment like this felt like a rather tacky addition to the film that only hampers the already poor narrative structure. Worse still, there are other similar occurrences like this throughout the rest of the story.One of the biggest problems with the original ""Captain Marvel"" film was how weakly written the title character was, with her lack of likeable character traits and overly serious demeanour being a major reason why she is not viewed favourably by fans. You'd expect the filmmakers to remedy this problem for the sequel, but you would be wrong. I'm not sure whether it's Brie Larson's underwhelming performance or just plain old bad writing but I have never once felt any fondness for Carol Danvers as a person. As mentioned above, she efficiently fights her way through many bad guys with no issue whatsoever, never once showing any emotional weakness or other potential vulnerabilities. Because of this, Carol Danvers never feels like a real person, being nothing more than a one-dimensional superhero that is practically impossible for anybody to identify with. Her character has not changed or grown since the first film, and it looks like she won't be doing so anytime soon.I keep trying to remind myself of Monica Rambeau's contribution to the story but nothing memorable ever comes to mind without doing some kind of online research. Like Brie Larson, there is nothing especially remarkable about Teyonah Parris's performance, as her character is as bland as she comes. Though it is established that Rambeau looked up to Carol Danvers as a child, her role in this story is nothing more than playing second fiddle to an already dull lead protagonist. Yes, Rambeau is very strong and yes, she is more than capable of taking care of herself in a fight, but beyond that what else does she offer? Most of the time she just goes along with Danvers's orders without ever questioning her or giving her personal opinions, making her nothing more than a blind follower. I was hoping to have seen some kind of opposing dynamic between Danvers and Rambeau, as that would have given their characters an important amount of depth the distinguish the two from one another. No such luck I'm afraid.The only character I sort of cared about was Kamala Khan, whose childlike naiveté made her the most relatable of the three leads. In her feature film debut, Iman Vellani does carry over many of Khan's human traits from the Disney+ series ""Ms. Marvel"", being that she's still young and coming to terms with mastering her powers. Unfortunately, she does not achieve this through the character herself, but rather due to how woefully underwritten her two co-stars are in comparison. I wanted to see the three as kindred spirits, fighting as trio but standing out as individuals. Instead, all we get are two dull, stoic, overpowered adults and a young kid working together for no other reason than because the writers said so.As depressing as it sounds, the once mighty MCU is showing no signs of improvement as ""The Marvels"" just may be the worst film in the series so far. There simply isn't enough reason to justify its existence outside of some kind of contractual obligation by the higher ups at Disney, and I fully respect many people's decision to skip it altogether. At this point, I seriously doubt the MCU can ever return to its former glory, as this film is set to become the series' biggest box office bomb to date. I can only hope in vain that Disney will learn an important lesson from this film's failure, but knowing their track record that seems unlikely.I rate it 4/10."
"Marvels","danieljfarthing","9 January 2024",110,"2019's ""Captain Marvel"" wasn't too bad, for a superhero movie, but its sequel ""The Marvels"" is an unmitigated stinking disaster - the WORST Marvel movie to date (which is saying something). Set a decade or two after the original, Brie Larson (via Samuel L Jackson) teams somewhat inadvertently with Teyonah Parris & Iman Vellani (awful) to save Gary Lewis' people (what happened to previous leader Ben Mendelsohn?!) from evil Zawe Ashton. Director Nia DaCosta (who also co-wrote this tripe with Megan McDonnell & Elissa Karasik) creates a headache inducing, fast (as if bizarrely sped up), frantic, thoroughly annoying, tiresome piece of garbage.

"Marvels","ThereelscoopwithKK","10 November 2023",110,"This second installment makes the original Captain Marvel look like a cinematic masterpiece... Nothing about this movie works. Although Brie Larson's acting has improved over the years it feels like she doesn't want to be there for this at all. Further, when you break it down, there is really no story at all happening. In fact, the solution to the entire problem is so extremely simple and solvable that you really wonder why there was a conflict in the first place. So much of everything is unexplained and eventually you stop trying to figure it out because you eventually lose all interest . Samuel L Jackson's character , Nick Fury, is hardly even a shell of his former self and is essentially now demoted to comedic relief.The scenes don't really mesh together at all. None of them are really necessary to advancing a plot and all feature the same repeated choreographic battle. The villain lacks any real charisma and is only provided a very brief backstory. Overall she never feels like too much of a threat.There's one part in particular that I think is absolutely a candidate for worst sequence of 2023. Without spoiling it , it is essentially a planet that looks like a cheap rip off of the Wizard of Oz. It just captures all of the problems with this movie into one scene. There's been a lot of less than stellar work from Marvel since endgame, but this is reaching new depths.I'm not even going to get started on the cats scene with the theme song....Please Loki, reset the entire timeline."

It was only going to go downhill from there.Watching this movie felt like watching a beloved friend in a coma fighting for her life. It was sad, frustrating and ultimately hopeless. So much potential squandered right before our very eyes.Much has been said about the Girl Power aspect of this story, but it doesn't mean jack when the characters are so thinly written. After the big character tension build up between Carol and Monica, with the latter resenting her for not coming back, their fractures mend themselves very quickly. There is no chemistry between the the two at all.The villain is Bland with a capitol B, and highly forgettable.Nick Fury is actually pathetic in this movie. He doesn't at all act like the Fury we know and love. He was more in character in Far From Home when Talos was impersonating him!I don't think I've ever had this much of a bad experience with a film since Cats. And it is telling that there actually features a ludicrous scene involving baby flerkens and the song Memory.What the actual hell, Marvel?The only good thing is that it is mercifully short, and Iman Vellani does seem to be enjoying herself in the role.Once a great studio, brought crumbling down on itself. If I could give it zero stars, I would."

This is definitely one of the worst Marvels movie I have seen out of all the Marvel movies I had watched. There really isn't too much to say about the movie because ""The Marvels"" is pretty much like almost every single Marvel movie but the writing, humor, direction, and performances are pretty much all over the place. Director Nia DaCosta has made ""Little Woods"" which I liked but her direction here is pretty bad and goes all over the place.The special effects are kind of rough on the edges, the actions and thrills were just okay and the performances, despite a pretty good cast, they aren't very good. Brie Larson is an actress I like but unfortunately her performance felt weak and lacking. The other performances as well including the child performances. The story isn't interesting as the writing is pretty bland and none of the characters were interesting.

"Marvels","kevin_robbins","12 November 2023",310,"My wife and I recently caught Marvel's (2023) in theaters. The plot revolves around Captain Marvel's mistake in choosing sides during a battle, disrupting the cosmic balance. Two young ladies gain powers in the process, and Captain Marvel must collaborate with them to rectify her error and restore equilibrium to the universe.Directed by Nia DaCosta (Candyman) and featuring Brie Larson (Lessons in Chemistry), Teyonah Parris (Dear White People), Iman Vellani (Ms. Marvel), Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction), and Zawe Ashton (Blitz).This film boasts clean and classic Marvel-style characters, cinematography, action scenes, and special effects. However, the plot seems somewhat lackluster, with Captain Marvel possibly appearing more as a villain than a hero. The backstories of the heroes lack sufficient development, making it challenging to form a connection with them. The cat steals the show initially but feels overdone by the end, and even Samuel L. Jackson's wit falls short of expectations.In summary, this superhero movie prioritizes its message over a compelling storyline. While the characters and visuals are in line with Marvel's trademark style, the plot may leave audiences indifferent. The lack of character depth and an engaging storyline earns this film a 3/10, making it a skip-worthy experience."

The script is awful and the story is super rushed and poorly executed, which both have an impact on how well the characters (and in-turn the actors) come-across on-screenThe action and humour are kind of alright, and the VFX are definitely better than anything we've seen in an MCU project since Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness (with the obvious exceptions of Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 and Loki Season 2), but that still doesn't exactly make it look greatThis movie is just painful to watch at points! Early on, it has some really fun moments, and felt like it could have actually been somewhat entertaining, but that feeling vanished as soon as it came. It's barley better than Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania, so you can do with that information what you will."

I could not finish watching this really bad film, it is just junk from scene to scene. The cast, I feel so sorry for them because the cast is a fine group for the most part...but the story, the effects, the directing are all jumbled up into a real mess. The premise is interesting but they have no idea what to do with it. I have never been a fan of Disney, maybe when I was 10 years old, back in the early 60s, but this is not at all Walt Disney. This is Disney INC and a massive number of talentless paperwork and book-keepers make their films these days.

"Marvels","OnlyAtJMart","12 November 2023",410,"Anyone who heard the news about this project knows that the production was a nightmare, and it shows in the final product here. It's like they couldn't figure out what direction to go, so they made 4 versions, and blended them together. Which would explain the high budget, the 5 delays, and the reshoots. Kamala's character was probably the best part of the movie. I promise you, the script did her no favors, but she stood out. Her acting was in line with her character. This was probably an exciting opportunity for her, and she wasn't going to let a bad script, and production problems stop her from giving a great effort. However, the story, the dialogue, the musical gimmick, the weak villain. It just didn't work. I don't think the blame lies solely with the actors, or even the director, who did lack the experience for helming a movie with a budget this size. I think Disney interfered heavily with the production, which almost always yields bad results. I think it was doomed to fail. They put so much pressure on this being successful, they forgot to make it coherent, unique, or interesting."
"Marvels","mildlyintrusive","13 November 2023",210,"Once in a while I tend to go to my local theater to check out something new, maybe a new release or a re-run of a movie. Today, I stumbled upon The Marvels, I thought ""Hey, I haven't been going to the theater this month that often, maybe I should try this out?"" And well, it seems that I'd made the wrong decision. The Marvels follows the titular Marvels trying to stop an evil Kree with one disadvantage however, every time they use their powers, it's Freaky Friday.Maybe its because of the very troubled production but everything just feels like an amalgamation of three separate movies, its like a ADHD experience. The movie does NOT take itself seriously at all, and as a result, it makes me hard to care for literally everything! Its like a circus act masquerading as a movie, it doesn't work! There were moments where characters were in danger and they start joking about it every opportunity they get. To add insult to injury was the treatment of the character of Nick Fury, who feels like a completely different character altogether, cracking lame after lame jokes every single time! Special effects were decent, but considering the massive 271M+ budget I wished they could've at least cared about the plot and flesh out some if the characters and their motivations instead of relying on action scene after action scene, it gets tiring after a while you know?Brie Larson herself looks tired and forced in this movie, her character also being this girl-boss who can sweep through enemies in this movie, no weaknesses and no vulnerabilities. It all feels so one-dimensional, it tries to be like a 80s action star with the likes of Arnold and co. But fails because they lack charisma and charm. Because of this I found it impossible to relate to her in any sense of way. Monica Rambeau wasn't trying her best here, and there is no opposing dynamic between the two to the point where I found her virtually indistinguishable from Mrs. Danvers herself. However I do commend Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan, whose child-like personality I was comfortable with and is the standout between the three leads but suffers from being very underwritten and the villain is a copy-and-paste from dozens we've seen before.Overall, a messy and disjointed movie with not much to offer rather than annoying, dreadful humor and some few flashy action scenes. It certainly feels like homework for the MCU as it struggles to keep a hook in something after the Infinity Saga. Skip this one and play with your action figures instead, Im sure it'll be better than this."
"Marvels","critic-97-417657","4 February 2024",810,"The movie was somewhat ridiculous, but I found myself giggling throughout it. It was actually quite fun. There were a lot of really charming things about this movie, and while the storyline lacked any real tension, I didn't really care. It was mostly about the character development, and the relationships between the three main characters. Overall, I just found it really fun and just didn't take it very seriously. In a lot of ways, it is a set up for the rest of the series, and is definitely not a standalone movie. And the post credit scene, amazing. Ties in a lot of potential for what they are going to be doing in this franchise."
"Marvels","The-Sarkologist","7 February 2024",710,"Well, I guess someone was right when they said that one of the big problems with this film was that you had to like watch 8 other films and 3 series to sort of understand what was going on. Mind you, I have actually done just that, but even then with the amount of time that had passed since I watched the other things it was still a little tricky understanding what was happening.Mind you, I did actually quite like the film. Like the scenes where they were switching places whenever they used their powers together, and also the big bad in the film, that was in part trying to save her people, but also attempting to punish Captain Marvel for what she had done to her people. Yeah, as it turned out, when she destroyed the great intelligence it sent the Kree into a massive civil war which basically destroyed their planet.So, if you had seen Miss Marvel, you will know that she has a thing for Captain Marvel, and of course it was always going to be a thing that she was eventually going to be involved in a team up. Also, there were some hints at the end that suggested that there was going to be another team-up film, though apparently that will still be some way off (and the problem will be that, no doubt, when they get around to it, all of them will be too old to be members of a possible Young Avengers - kids do grow up a little too fast).Yeah, I thought that this film was pretty good, though I have to agree that the problem is that you do need to catch up to speed to understand what is going on. Oh, it also seemed that it felt that it was a bit over the place, no doubt because they wanted to make the film shorter than a lot of the others. Still, it's good, especially if you are up to date on the films."
"Marvels","cherold","30 January 2024",710,"After the bad reviews, and considering how many bad superhero movies have come out lately, I would have skipped this one if the trailer didn't look like so much fun. Fortunately, the movie fulfills the trailer's promiseIn the movie, three superheroes with related powers find themselves suddenly swapping places with one another. The proves to be a good gimmick for both action and comedy, as the three keep finding themselves in one another's battles. Eventually, they master the situation in order to take down a very angry villain with an unusually sympathetic backstory.The movie leans heavily - and for the most part successfully - into the comedy. A big chunk of this is fueled by the teenage Captain Marvel fangirl Ms. Marvel, who is from a TV series I found too pre-teen-oriented to enjoy. Ms. Marvel's an annoying character but for the most part I found her amusing in this.There's also a funny gag with alien cats.While I enjoyed this movie, I have to admit its a bit of an unfocussed mess. There are a lot of elements just tossed in, like a whole thing with Marvel #3, Monica, dealing with her abandonment issues. These occasional ""emotional"" moments don't much interest me.Anyway, a lot of people hate this, but if you like the trailer, I'd say chance the movie (I did not take a chance on the last Aquaman movie because unlike The Marvels, the trailer looked just as bad as people said the movie was.Going against the current, I say if you want a bunch of comedy and some fun action then you should watch this one."
"Marvels","drawlife","8 November 2023",510,"THE MARVELS is here and it's a mashed up film that is totally all over the place. It feels as if this film was edited and chopped into pieces during post and it shows.Couple things I enjoyed, I did like seeing Carol Danvers and Monica Rambeau resolve and acknowledge their relationship, but due to the nature of their characters being straight arrows, it allows Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan to be the audience just as Tom Holland's Peter Parker was in CIVIL WAR. I did not particularly enjoy the MS. MARVEL series, but I can see her being the shoutout for many.I think the script just touched on the surface of Brie Larson's Captain Marvel herself, so diving into her more is a plus, however the story did her no favors once again and I did feel like she was given like four or five pieces of direction to portray her character compared to the more one-note performance in the first film. Teyonah Parris is commendable. She was the more science-y of the trio.Samuel L. Jackson just feels inconsistent especially after SECRET INVASION. Feels like this Nick Fury is a variant. He's simply passing through in this film.Another thing I liked was the incursions (also briefly touched on in DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS). We all complained about the lack of planting seeds for the future leading into KANG DYNASTY and SECRET WARS. Finally, this film it at least preps and teases what's to come down the line.The MCU's villain problem is a long known fact, but here it only cements their problem even further. Now I'm a fan of Lee Pace's over the top performance as Ronan, but Dar-Benn played by Zawe Ashton is literally a copy and paste of Ronan, but female. Nothing new about it. Definitely up there as one of the worst villains in the MCU.The power swaps were kinda cool so I can give it that. Nia DaCosta does a good job executing the fight scenes, but again as one should expect, VFX is meh. Now if you cringed during the musical note duel between the two Doctor Strange, then wait till you see one segment of the film where it feels like a misplaced musical. Lots of quirky and annoying humor like one should expect in an MCU film.The Skrulls are in the film and as a fan we always think we can write the better film after watching it, but I just DO NOT understand why this sequel couldn't have been SECRET INVASION(one of the worst MCU Disney+ shows). SECRET INVASION honestly should have been an Avengers film or at the very least a Captain Marvel sequel co-starring some Avengers, kinda like CIVIL WAR. I personally feel like that dilemma could have furthered Captain Marvel's development due to her involvement with them and how she's equally to blame for not helping them out when she and Fury promised to find them a home. But instead she's stuck with this material.The mid-credit scene is arguably the best part. Once again teasing things to come. It's stuff that like that, that will maybe still garner interest in the MCU despite its current fall from grace. The end-credit scene is alright. Not particularly jazzed about that promise down the line.On that note, the recent Variety article published about Marvel Studios talked about their behind the scenes trouble. It was said that Kevin Feige and his creative committee partook in their yearly Palm Springs retreat to regroup and refocus, so here's hoping to next year being more consistent with quality. Seemed like he was spread too thin with the mandate to have more quantity than quality.THE MARVELS is a season 1.5 for MS. MARVEL and a CAPTAIN MARVEL sequel that we never saw due to the flashbacks and exposition to explain things. And let's be clear, at this point everything feels like homework. That was going to be inevitable moving forward after INFINITY WAR and ENDGAMGE, but especially when Disney+ was announced making Kevin Feige spread out too thin. But it only feels like homework because everything that has been released is below the standard of what Marvel set up for us.So to sum it up, while I did find it slightly more appealing than the first CAPTAIN MARVEL and QUANTUMANIA, that isn't saying much. Low expectations definitely helped. Is THE MARVELS one of the worst? No, but it definitely belongs way down below the list.5/10."
"Marvels","tibby_23","17 January 2024",410,"By far the worst Marvel movie so far, I am extremely disappointed. After the mess that Thor 4 was, I was hoping that Marvel learned its lesson, but it seems not. I am honestly happy this movie did bad at the box office, that's what you get for ruining such a great character (I loved Cpt. Marvel from the comics).What makes it bad:
Action moves way too fast from one scene to anotherNo character improvement or growth by the end of the movieThings just happen with no storytellingNot serious enough, too childish for my tasteToo many goofy moments (singing, really? We've come this low, Marvel?)End scenes that try to set the context for next movies seem forced and unnecessaryI also found two good things eventually:
I liked the villain and her story, sympathized with her a bitAt least the movie was not long.These writers should never be hired again."
"Marvels","olcare","10 November 2023",410,"Criticizing specific parts of the movie became confusing for me as there were so many details I wanted to change. This film truly disappointed me, especially since my expectations were already low, and falling below them is a bad sign for Marvel. It had a Thor: Love and Thunder vibe, which I also disliked (4/10). I had been excited after watching Loki in the morning, but it was in vain.For me, the unbearable part was the music. After checking the playlists of movies I've watched for a long time, Marvel had by far the worst compositions. The music was exaggerated, drowning out the impact of fight scenes and making them unbearable. It was like overly noisy background music during a break.Another aspect I didn't like was the main villain. I can't believe Marvel fell into the same mistake again. The villain was poorly written, and Zawe Ashton's performance felt forced, appearing awkward in scenes. One major reason for this was the poor portrayal of the Kree Empire in the MCU. Neglecting the significance of the Kree made Supreme look bad. They could have explained the critical situation of the 'Hala' planet in the film's opening with a 30-35 minute sequence, providing context for the desperation of the Kree.Another thing I found absurd was Monica teleporting to a parallel universe. They portrayed the concept of parallel universes like child's play. Especially after watching Loki Season 2 in the morning, her randomly teleporting or getting stuck in another universe seemed too simplistic.Seeing Professor Beast was surprising and pleasing. The X-Men era is beginning, and despite the poor productions, I'm excited. Brie Larson was good again, carrying her character well. The scene with Monica, Kamala, Danvers vs Dar-Benn was good, thankfully without music. However, despite not being a fan of Kamala Khan, her origin is preserved, and it's not bad. But I feel there's a lack of harmony among our main three characters, and I believe it's a script issue, not an actor one.While I like the idea of saving a planet by traveling through different planets, I didn't like the execution at all. Presenting such a serious and contemporary issue as if it's the simplest thing with childlike music seems somewhat unserious to me.However it turns out, this film paved the way for others and served as a stepping stone. Hopefully, with Beast in Deadpool 3, the overall MCU storyline will improve, abandoning mediocrity urgently; otherwise, it will continue to receive poor ratings.Note: I forgot to mention in the review, but Goose is a fantastic character, and I hope we continue to see this adorable cat. The scene with all the cats was genuinely entertaining, one of the enjoyable moments in 4-5 scenes."
"Marvels","alensufli","8 November 2023",210,"Even writing a review is extremely pointless as we all knew what we were expecting months before but here I am. They even themselves admitted it. The film is a huge disappointment. The plot is all over the place. Actions sequences were sometimes good but sometime were so dumb I didn't know where to look, where to pay attention. I like how they tried to catch the old marvel magic. Yes. They tried. But they utterly failed. Feige pulled off ""wait until the post credit scene to get excited cuz the film itself is boring"" trick again. And it wasn't a ""wow"" for me at least. The theatre was silent throughout and after the film. No one even made a giggling sound. Dead silence. Jokes were landing facedown to the ground every time a character made one. That's right. Every character there is comic relief. And I absolutely don't wanna talk about acting."
"Marvels","S3pt3m63r","18 November 2023",NA,"Unfortunately if you haven't got Disney plus and you don't keep to speed with the tv series, then you this movie won't make much sense as it relies on you knowing what's going on in that universe so far, which I'm not up to date with and involves the Miss Marvels characters which haven't been introduced in the movies. Confusing.I had hoped that following Guardians 3 it could've get much worse for the Marvel universe, at least Guardians has Rocket😂It's hard to find any plot to this movie. Carol Danvers (Captain Marvel) does throw a lot of people through the roof but the plot is a quantum entanglement mess. The movie is blissfully short but feels longer as it's so bad and some people walked out of the theatre. I was so pleasantly when it ended.I think it's about to retire the whole Marvel superhero franchise as this phase is going badly."
"Marvels","nscoby93","10 November 2023",210,"I actually had no intention of watching this film in theaters. Originally, I was just going to wait for its home release on Disney Plus, but after recently rewatching WandaVision, I genuinely wanted to see how they would handle Monica Rambeau and see what they would do with her.So I'll mention the positives for this film first...The movie is actually pretty, I really enjoyed the film aesthetically it looked good. This is very surprising to say as recent Marvel projects are tremendous eye sores.The films central characters, Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) and Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani), were surprisingly good. I had fully anticipated to dislike Captain Marvel and Ms Marvel in this film but I surprisingly enjoyed them both which is a big compliment coming from me, and Monica Rambeau is my favorite of the three she was good as I expected and anticipated. All three actresses gave enjoyable performances, and they all worked well together on screen.Then, of course, Samuel Jackson is always great! And the return of everyone's favorite Flerken kitty Goose. She had a great sequence that I refuse to spoil, but it had me dying. Goose saved this film!And well that's it...This film is just bad. Bad writing, bad pacing, bad storytelling. Nothing in this film is properly set up as it rushes through its 1 hour and 45 minute run time. Which is quite frankly fine for me as I genuinely did not want more of this.This movie as a whole is just overwhelmingly safe. It has no stakes, takes no risks, and does nothing. But there is actual enjoyment in its failings. It was so bad that it was good. The amount of eye rolling, face palms, and sighs I gave through this film was astonishing. I gave up on this film within the first 30 minutes, and afterward, that's when the enjoyment began because of how bad it went on to be.Then suddenly, out of nowhere, the film became a musical? Like what is happening? This film is so chaotic and unstructured. It just never stopped.The film had a good mid-credit scene so you know stay for that. Unfortunately, it was spoiled for me, so it didn't hit as hard as it could have. Especially if you're a fan of the actor who originally played the character the scene introduces.But The Marvels was exactly what I anticipated it to be, a below average dump. Which is a shame because they play with some interesting concepts in this film, but they do nothing with them, or they are just poorly handled. I can at least say I didn't hate this movie. Unfortunately, I just enjoyed it for all the wrong reasons.IMDb: 3/10

Once you get over its not adding anything or revealing any easter eggs, you can enjoy it for what it is.All three main characters deliver on their role, and it improves on captain marvels solo outing. Sit down take any preconceived ideas you have, remove any anticipation of easter eggs and enjoy it for what it is.Has marvel lost its way, yes.

"Marvels","brentsbulletinboard","11 November 2023",510,"When I first heard the title of this movie, I thought it was about a 1960s girls' singing group. And, frankly, that would have probably made for a better movie. Writer-director Nia DaCosta's third feature outing and the latest in the Marvel Universe paradigm is a wildly inconsistent superhero movie that tries too hard to do too much and doesn't have a script to support it. Too many of its plot elements aren't adequately explained until well into the story, while others aren't explained at all, leaving viewers who aren't comic book laureates wondering what's going on (particularly at film's end). Meanwhile, other narrative aspects frequently appear gimmicky and grow old quickly, such as the introduction of the primary superpower that its three protagonists share, one that almost becomes slapstickish after an all-too-brief while. On top of that, the CGI effects vacillate from one end of the quality spectrum to the other, creating a mix of images that are either startling to look at or stunningly cheesy at best. Add to that a villain that isn't particularly menacing, along with attempts at humor that either succeed brilliantly (cat lovers take note) or fall flat and look incredibly lame (as aficionados of musical theater will undoubtedly attest), all of which further add to the picture's pervasive inconsistency. The inclusion of ample clues for advancing the overarching Marvel Universe storyline continues here, too, furthering a trend that's growing tiresome in the studio's releases, a development akin to the ""Paul is dead"" legacy come to life with every passing picture. Then there's the trio of heroes themselves, who often appear more like they've been plucked from a giddy slumber party flick or a Cyndi Lauper video than taking center stage as seriously empowered champions in an action-adventure offering. All of these failings combine to make this production more of a forgettable placeholder in the Marvel mythology than a standalone feature (not to mention a pale substitute for a sequel to the far-superior film that launched the Captain Marvel franchise in 2019). In short, ""The Marvels"" is as much of a mess as it is a movie, and that's troubling for several reasons. It lends credence to the growing criticism that films like this aren't to be taken seriously. It reinforces the notion that they're cookie-cutter in nature, easily interchangeable with one another. And it raises questions about the career choices of lead actress Brie Larson, who, though quite capable of playing roles like these, is running the risk of becoming type-cast, a troubling prospect for an Academy Award-winning actress who possesses a depth of talent and is handily adept at taking on better and more serious material than this. In the wake of this release, Marvel Studios should take a step back and seriously assess where its future is headed, especially if movies like this are any indication. As pictures like ""Wakanda Forever"" (2022) show, the studio is capable of better work - and it's time to show viewers that."
"Marvels","Sleepin_Dragon","10 November 2023",410,"Carol Danvers is attempting to save the universe, but her incredible powers become entangled with those of Kamala Khan and Monica Rambeau, they must unite to save the world.Ouch, what can you say, this is surely one of Marvel's lowest points, I honestly don't know who the target audience is, or who this is going to appeal to, young teens only maybe? Anyhow, this was an absolute mess.The writing was clearly problematic, it doesn't gel, it is genuinely all over the place. I do very much wonder if huge sections of this film cut? It can be the only answer, it just doesn't flow at all, and that short run time...Special effects, some were pretty good, some were poor, I just wish there was a greater focus on plot, it just seemed like 100 minutes of CGI, noise and random events.Brie Larson, I'm not sure about you, but to me she looked totally disinterested and bored by the whole thing, what I didn't see, was someone committed to the role. I thought Samuel Jackson was rather good, but again poorly served by the script.It didn't look great from the trailers, and in reality, it's another clunker from Marvel Studios.4/10."
"Marvels","judywalker2","14 December 2023",510,"Went to see this movie with my 17- and 11-year-old granddaughters. One is a Ms. Marvel fan and the other is now. For me I was hoping for something that children and adults could enjoy. But, no only kids will enjoy this silly mess.I enjoyed the Captain Marvel movie and thought the criticism was not warranted. I also loved Wanda Vision and the introduction of Monica Rambeau and I was hoping for at least a good continuation of her story. I didn't watch Ms. Marvel because I'm not a teen and I knew it wasn't for me; and after watching her parts in this movie I'm glad I stuck to that.All three actresses are good and of course Samuel L in always a pleasure to see, but none of the other characters including the so-called villain were the least bit interesting. Most of the scenes were just downright silly. I hope they continue Monica's story with better writing and I wish Marvel would stop being silly and go back to making movies for adults and kids."
"Marvels","isaacsundaralingam","11 November 2023",310,"The MCU has absolutely overstayed its welcome. Post Avengers Endgame, these projects have been feeling more and more like content than cinema (except the rare surprises like GOTG 3). Superhero fatigue, they call it and this movie does practically nothing but to amp it up to 11.You watch the trailer, you know what happens. You bet on originality, you end up homeless. There's nothing new for me to say that I haven't already said about any of the other MCU content as of late. It's so generic that I'm confident a year from now, no one would remember this movie even existed. With every new MCU project, the jokes-per-minute ratio keeps getting worse, the villains are a writer's version of a stock photograph (I can't even remember the villain's name in this movie and it hasn't even been a day since I watched it), the CGI is so out there you can almost see the CGI artists' tears on screen, and it's getting more and more difficult to tell each MCU project apart cos they're all just the same.The only few positives I can identify here are actresses Iman Vellani and Brie Larson (Larson, who seems much more relaxed and settled into her superhero boots), and maybe the flashy action sequences. Otherwise, there's nothing here to watch, nothing here to experience and nothing here to enjoy. What a shame."
"Marvels","MrDHWong","9 November 2023",410,"""The Marvels"" is the sequel to 2019's ""Captain Marvel"", a continuation of the Disney+ series ""Ms. Marvel"", and the 33rd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris, and Iman Vellani, it represents a painful look at the downward spiral the MCU has found itself caught in since the end of Phase 3.Sometime after the events of ""Captain Marvel"", Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) has unintentionally started a civil war among the alien race known as the Kree. The leader of the Kree, Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton), soon finds one half of the Quantum Bands and later seeks out the other half, which is in the possession of Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel (Iman Vellani). At the request of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Carol teams up with Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) to negotiate peace among the Kree, but as the two investigate a wormhole in outer space, Monica, Carol, and Kamala start mysteriously switching powers with one another. Realising something is amiss, the trio are forced to work together to figure out what is causing this strange phenomena and hopefully put a stop to both Dar-Benn and the warring Kree.It's becoming harder and harder to call myself fan of the MCU, given the array of serviceable to terrible projects they have been churning out lately. To be fair though, it is a tall order to top something as ambitious as the culmination of over ten years worth of universe building after both ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and ""Avengers: Endgame"" pulled it off so effectively years ago. For the longest time, I have been willing to defend the post-Endgame MCU for trying different things, as I was under the impression that all of this would be leading to exciting new projects on the horizon. However, after sitting through ""The Marvels"", I can say with a hint of heartbreak that practically all of my optimism for the MCU's future has all but disappeared, as it contains next to nothing worth defending from a creative standpoint.Perhaps the best way to describe my viewing experience with this film would be ""apathetic"", because at no point does it ever feel like anything important is at stake. This is mainly due to either our three heroes being too overpowered or there not being enough information provided about the ones who need saving. Whenever a horde of enemies are swarming the trio, we watch as the three of them effortlessly take them out without even breaking a sweat. Action-packed moments like these that once elicited excitement have now been reduced to a series of bland fistfights and generic CGI blasts that have all been done before in better MCU films.We see Carol Danvers quickly blast everyone away with her energy beams and block punches with her hands, never once showing any signs that she is in real danger. Her accomplice Monica Rambeau does pretty much the same thing, only with less time on screen. Even Kamala Khan, who is the biggest fish-out-of-water in this situation, has no major trouble dealing with foes coming at her from every angle, always using her half of the Quantum Band to her advantage. How is it possible to keep the audience on their toes if the enemy forces are so inefficient that even an inexperienced child can wipe the floor with them this easily? On that note, it also doesn't help that none of these three heroes appear to have any physical weaknesses or personal insecurities holding them back, which causes all of the tension to evaporate instantly.In addition to this, we are barely shown anything interesting about the Kree that will keep the audience invested in their role in the story. As far as the film is concerned, they are nothing more than a stock species of extraterrestrials that are causing problems simply because the plot demands it. The original ""Captain Marvel"" film established that the Kree were the ones who inadvertently gave Carol her powers and took her in among them. Yet, this film never reminds the audience of that, instead opting to throw them right into the thick of the conflict without any important context. As a result, I just did not care at all about what happened to any of these people.It's also worth mentioning that this film is rife with obvious re-edits and tonal inconsistencies. One scene where this is most evident is where Carol Danvers is opening up to both Rambeau and Khan about her relationship with the Kree. What could have been a good method of showcasing Danvers's humanity is instead brushed aside for something completely unrelated after less than two minutes. I couldn't help but assume that this scene was supposed to go on much longer but was cut in post production for whatever reason. To add insult to injury, the scene is then immediately followed by a strange attempt at comic relief which fails to raise even a single laugh. Although Marvel films are known for their blending of comedy with drama, a moment like this felt like a rather tacky addition to the film that only hampers the already poor narrative structure. Worse still, there are other similar occurrences like this throughout the rest of the story.One of the biggest problems with the original ""Captain Marvel"" film was how weakly written the title character was, with her lack of likeable character traits and overly serious demeanour being a major reason why she is not viewed favourably by fans. You'd expect the filmmakers to remedy this problem for the sequel, but you would be wrong. I'm not sure whether it's Brie Larson's underwhelming performance or just plain old bad writing but I have never once felt any fondness for Carol Danvers as a person. As mentioned above, she efficiently fights her way through many bad guys with no issue whatsoever, never once showing any emotional weakness or other potential vulnerabilities. Because of this, Carol Danvers never feels like a real person, being nothing more than a one-dimensional superhero that is practically impossible for anybody to identify with. Her character has not changed or grown since the first film, and it looks like she won't be doing so anytime soon.I keep trying to remind myself of Monica Rambeau's contribution to the story but nothing memorable ever comes to mind without doing some kind of online research. Like Brie Larson, there is nothing especially remarkable about Teyonah Parris's performance, as her character is as bland as she comes. Though it is established that Rambeau looked up to Carol Danvers as a child, her role in this story is nothing more than playing second fiddle to an already dull lead protagonist. Yes, Rambeau is very strong and yes, she is more than capable of taking care of herself in a fight, but beyond that what else does she offer? Most of the time she just goes along with Danvers's orders without ever questioning her or giving her personal opinions, making her nothing more than a blind follower. I was hoping to have seen some kind of opposing dynamic between Danvers and Rambeau, as that would have given their characters an important amount of depth the distinguish the two from one another. No such luck I'm afraid.The only character I sort of cared about was Kamala Khan, whose childlike naiveté made her the most relatable of the three leads. In her feature film debut, Iman Vellani does carry over many of Khan's human traits from the Disney+ series ""Ms. Marvel"", being that she's still young and coming to terms with mastering her powers. Unfortunately, she does not achieve this through the character herself, but rather due to how woefully underwritten her two co-stars are in comparison. I wanted to see the three as kindred spirits, fighting as trio but standing out as individuals. Instead, all we get are two dull, stoic, overpowered adults and a young kid working together for no other reason than because the writers said so.As depressing as it sounds, the once mighty MCU is showing no signs of improvement as ""The Marvels"" just may be the worst film in the series so far. There simply isn't enough reason to justify its existence outside of some kind of contractual obligation by the higher ups at Disney, and I fully respect many people's decision to skip it altogether. At this point, I seriously doubt the MCU can ever return to its former glory, as this film is set to become the series' biggest box office bomb to date. I can only hope in vain that Disney will learn an important lesson from this film's failure, but knowing their track record that seems unlikely.I rate it 4/10."

Set a decade or two after the original, Brie Larson (via Samuel L Jackson) teams somewhat inadvertently with Teyonah Parris & Iman Vellani (awful) to save Gary Lewis' people (what happened to previous leader Ben Mendelsohn?!) from evil Zawe Ashton.

Although Brie Larson's acting has improved over the years it feels like she doesn't want to be there for this at all. Further, when you break it down, there is really no story at all happening. In fact, the solution to the entire problem is so extremely simple and solvable that you really wonder why there was a conflict in the first place. So much of everything is unexplained and eventually you stop trying to figure it out because you eventually lose all interest . Samuel L Jackson's character , Nick Fury, is hardly even a shell of his former self and is essentially now demoted to comedic relief.The scenes don't really mesh together at all. None of them are really necessary to advancing a plot and all feature the same repeated choreographic battle. The villain lacks any real charisma and is only provided a very brief backstory. Overall she never feels like too much of a threat.There's one part in particular that I think is absolutely a candidate for worst sequence of 2023. Without spoiling it , it is essentially a planet that looks like a cheap rip off of the Wizard of Oz. It just captures all of the problems with this movie into one scene. There's been a lot of less than stellar work from Marvel since endgame, but this is reaching new depths.I'm not even going to get started on the cats scene with the theme song....Please Loki, reset the entire timeline."
"Marvels","Avwillfan89","23 December 2023",110,"This film is somehow way more depressing and worse than Ant Man Quantumania. We honestly thought Eternals was bad, but that was only the beginning. It was only going to go downhill from there.Watching this movie felt like watching a beloved friend in a coma fighting for her life. It was sad, frustrating and ultimately hopeless. So much potential squandered right before our very eyes.Much has been said about the Girl Power aspect of this story, but it doesn't mean jack when the characters are so thinly written. After the big character tension build up between Carol and Monica, with the latter resenting her for not coming back, their fractures mend themselves very quickly. There is no chemistry between the the two at all.The villain is Bland with a capitol B, and highly forgettable.Nick Fury is actually pathetic in this movie. He doesn't at all act like the Fury we know and love. He was more in character in Far From Home when Talos was impersonating him!I don't think I've ever had this much of a bad experience with a film since Cats. And it is telling that there actually features a ludicrous scene involving baby flerkens and the song Memory.What the actual hell, Marvel?The only good thing is that it is mercifully short, and Iman Vellani does seem to be enjoying herself in the role.Once a great studio, brought crumbling down on itself. If I could give it zero stars, I would."
"Marvels","chenp-54708","10 November 2023",210,"Marvel movies really have fallen apart haven't they? This is definitely one of the worst Marvels movie I have seen out of all the Marvel movies I had watched. There really isn't too much to say about the movie because ""The Marvels"" is pretty much like almost every single Marvel movie but the writing, humor, direction, and performances are pretty much all over the place. Director Nia DaCosta has made ""Little Woods"" which I liked but her direction here is pretty bad and goes all over the place.The special effects are kind of rough on the edges, the actions and thrills were just okay and the performances, despite a pretty good cast, they aren't very good. Brie Larson is an actress I like but unfortunately her performance felt weak and lacking. The other performances as well including the child performances. The story isn't interesting as the writing is pretty bland and none of the characters were interesting. With a short runtime, the movie surprisingly was really boring.I do like superhero movies but it seems this one really just sucked. Overall, it's bad."
"Marvels","kevin_robbins","12 November 2023",310,"My wife and I recently caught Marvel's (2023) in theaters. The plot revolves around Captain Marvel's mistake in choosing sides during a battle, disrupting the cosmic balance. Two young ladies gain powers in the process, and Captain Marvel must collaborate with them to rectify her error and restore equilibrium to the universe.Directed by Nia DaCosta (Candyman) and featuring Brie Larson (Lessons in Chemistry), Teyonah Parris (Dear White People), Iman Vellani (Ms. Marvel), Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction), and Zawe Ashton (Blitz).This film boasts clean and classic Marvel-style characters, cinematography, action scenes, and special effects. However, the plot seems somewhat lackluster, with Captain Marvel possibly appearing more as a villain than a hero. The backstories of the heroes lack sufficient development, making it challenging to form a connection with them. The cat steals the show initially but feels overdone by the end, and even Samuel L. Jackson's wit falls short of expectations.In summary, this superhero movie prioritizes its message over a compelling storyline. While the characters and visuals are in line with Marvel's trademark style, the plot may leave audiences indifferent. The lack of character depth and an engaging storyline earns this film a 3/10, making it a skip-worthy experience."
"Marvels","SHU_Movies","10 November 2023",310,"Going from the Loki Series Finale this morning to The Marvels this evening was (for lack of a better word) bonkers! The finale was perfect, and a beautiful ending to the show, while The Marvels is a complete mess. It's honestly given me whiplashThe Marvels is just an all-around bad movie. The script is awful and the story is super rushed and poorly executed, which both have an impact on how well the characters (and in-turn the actors) come-across on-screenThe action and humour are kind of alright, and the VFX are definitely better than anything we've seen in an MCU project since Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness (with the obvious exceptions of Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 and Loki Season 2), but that still doesn't exactly make it look greatThis movie is just painful to watch at points! Early on, it has some really fun moments, and felt like it could have actually been somewhat entertaining, but that feeling vanished as soon as it came. It's barley better than Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania, so you can do with that information what you will."
"Marvels","NanoFrog","16 January 2024",110,"So Stan Lee passes away and we get Disney now in full control of Marvel stories...and boy is there a difference. I could not finish watching this really bad film, it is just junk from scene to scene. The cast, I feel so sorry for them because the cast is a fine group for the most part...but the story, the effects, the directing are all jumbled up into a real mess. The premise is interesting but they have no idea what to do with it. I have never been a fan of Disney, maybe when I was 10 years old, back in the early 60s, but this is not at all Walt Disney. This is Disney INC and a massive number of talentless paperwork and book-keepers make their films these days. This is just junk slammed together by people who have no idea how to tell a story or stage intelligent effects. This film is not a Turkey, it is, in fact, just garbage. RIP MArvel."
"Marvels","OnlyAtJMart","12 November 2023",410,"Anyone who heard the news about this project knows that the production was a nightmare, and it shows in the final product here. It's like they couldn't figure out what direction to go, so they made 4 versions, and blended them together. Which would explain the high budget, the 5 delays, and the reshoots. Kamala's character was probably the best part of the movie. I promise you, the script did her no favors, but she stood out. Her acting was in line with her character. This was probably an exciting opportunity for her, and she wasn't going to let a bad script, and production problems stop her from giving a great effort. However, the story, the dialogue, the musical gimmick, the weak villain. It just didn't work. I don't think the blame lies solely with the actors, or even the director, who did lack the experience for helming a movie with a budget this size. I think Disney interfered heavily with the production, which almost always yields bad results. I think it was doomed to fail. They put so much pressure on this being successful, they forgot to make it coherent, unique, or interesting."
"Marvels","mildlyintrusive","13 November 2023",210,"Once in a while I tend to go to my local theater to check out something new, maybe a new release or a re-run of a movie. Today, I stumbled upon The Marvels, I thought ""Hey, I haven't been going to the theater this month that often, maybe I should try this out?"" And well, it seems that I'd made the wrong decision. The Marvels follows the titular Marvels trying to stop an evil Kree with one disadvantage however, every time they use their powers, it's Freaky Friday.Maybe its because of the very troubled production but everything just feels like an amalgamation of three separate movies, its like a ADHD experience. The movie does NOT take itself seriously at all, and as a result, it makes me hard to care for literally everything! Its like a circus act masquerading as a movie, it doesn't work! There were moments where characters were in danger and they start joking about it every opportunity they get. To add insult to injury was the treatment of the character of Nick Fury, who feels like a completely different character altogether, cracking lame after lame jokes every single time! Special effects were decent, but considering the massive 271M+ budget I wished they could've at least cared about the plot and flesh out some if the characters and their motivations instead of relying on action scene after action scene, it gets tiring after a while you know?Brie Larson herself looks tired and forced in this movie, her character also being this girl-boss who can sweep through enemies in this movie, no weaknesses and no vulnerabilities. It all feels so one-dimensional, it tries to be like a 80s action star with the likes of Arnold and co. But fails because they lack charisma and charm. Because of this I found it impossible to relate to her in any sense of way. Monica Rambeau wasn't trying her best here, and there is no opposing dynamic between the two to the point where I found her virtually indistinguishable from Mrs. Danvers herself. However I do commend Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan, whose child-like personality I was comfortable with and is the standout between the three leads but suffers from being very underwritten and the villain is a copy-and-paste from dozens we've seen before.Overall, a messy and disjointed movie with not much to offer rather than annoying, dreadful humor and some few flashy action scenes. It certainly feels like homework for the MCU as it struggles to keep a hook in something after the Infinity Saga. Skip this one and play with your action figures instead, Im sure it'll be better than this."
"Marvels","critic-97-417657","4 February 2024",810,"The movie was somewhat ridiculous, but I found myself giggling throughout it. It was actually quite fun. There were a lot of really charming things about this movie, and while the storyline lacked any real tension, I didn't really care. It was mostly about the character development, and the relationships between the three main characters. Overall, I just found it really fun and just didn't take it very seriously. In a lot of ways, it is a set up for the rest of the series, and is definitely not a standalone movie. And the post credit scene, amazing. Ties in a lot of potential for what they are going to be doing in this franchise."
"Marvels","The-Sarkologist","7 February 2024",710,"Well, I guess someone was right when they said that one of the big problems with this film was that you had to like watch 8 other films and 3 series to sort of understand what was going on. Mind you, I have actually done just that, but even then with the amount of time that had passed since I watched the other things it was still a little tricky understanding what was happening.Mind you, I did actually quite like the film. Like the scenes where they were switching places whenever they used their powers together, and also the big bad in the film, that was in part trying to save her people, but also attempting to punish Captain Marvel for what she had done to her people. Yeah, as it turned out, when she destroyed the great intelligence it sent the Kree into a massive civil war which basically destroyed their planet.So, if you had seen Miss Marvel, you will know that she has a thing for Captain Marvel, and of course it was always going to be a thing that she was eventually going to be involved in a team up. Also, there were some hints at the end that suggested that there was going to be another team-up film, though apparently that will still be some way off (and the problem will be that, no doubt, when they get around to it, all of them will be too old to be members of a possible Young Avengers - kids do grow up a little too fast).Yeah, I thought that this film was pretty good, though I have to agree that the problem is that you do need to catch up to speed to understand what is going on. Oh, it also seemed that it felt that it was a bit over the place, no doubt because they wanted to make the film shorter than a lot of the others. Still, it's good, especially if you are up to date on the films."
"Marvels","cherold","30 January 2024",710,"After the bad reviews, and considering how many bad superhero movies have come out lately, I would have skipped this one if the trailer didn't look like so much fun. Fortunately, the movie fulfills the trailer's promiseIn the movie, three superheroes with related powers find themselves suddenly swapping places with one another. The proves to be a good gimmick for both action and comedy, as the three keep finding themselves in one another's battles. Eventually, they master the situation in order to take down a very angry villain with an unusually sympathetic backstory.The movie leans heavily - and for the most part successfully - into the comedy. A big chunk of this is fueled by the teenage Captain Marvel fangirl Ms. Marvel, who is from a TV series I found too pre-teen-oriented to enjoy. Ms. Marvel's an annoying character but for the most part I found her amusing in this.There's also a funny gag with alien cats.While I enjoyed this movie, I have to admit its a bit of an unfocussed mess. There are a lot of elements just tossed in, like a whole thing with Marvel #3, Monica, dealing with her abandonment issues. These occasional ""emotional"" moments don't much interest me.Anyway, a lot of people hate this, but if you like the trailer, I'd say chance the movie (I did not take a chance on the last Aquaman movie because unlike The Marvels, the trailer looked just as bad as people said the movie was.Going against the current, I say if you want a bunch of comedy and some fun action then you should watch this one."
"Marvels","drawlife","8 November 2023",510,"THE MARVELS is here and it's a mashed up film that is totally all over the place. It feels as if this film was edited and chopped into pieces during post and it shows.Couple things I enjoyed, I did like seeing Carol Danvers and Monica Rambeau resolve and acknowledge their relationship, but due to the nature of their characters being straight arrows, it allows Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan to be the audience just as Tom Holland's Peter Parker was in CIVIL WAR. I did not particularly enjoy the MS. MARVEL series, but I can see her being the shoutout for many.I think the script just touched on the surface of Brie Larson's Captain Marvel herself, so diving into her more is a plus, however the story did her no favors once again and I did feel like she was given like four or five pieces of direction to portray her character compared to the more one-note performance in the first film. Teyonah Parris is commendable. She was the more science-y of the trio.Samuel L. Jackson just feels inconsistent especially after SECRET INVASION. Feels like this Nick Fury is a variant. He's simply passing through in this film.Another thing I liked was the incursions (also briefly touched on in DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS). We all complained about the lack of planting seeds for the future leading into KANG DYNASTY and SECRET WARS. Finally, this film it at least preps and teases what's to come down the line.The MCU's villain problem is a long known fact, but here it only cements their problem even further. Now I'm a fan of Lee Pace's over the top performance as Ronan, but Dar-Benn played by Zawe Ashton is literally a copy and paste of Ronan, but female. Nothing new about it. Definitely up there as one of the worst villains in the MCU.The power swaps were kinda cool so I can give it that. Nia DaCosta does a good job executing the fight scenes, but again as one should expect, VFX is meh. Now if you cringed during the musical note duel between the two Doctor Strange, then wait till you see one segment of the film where it feels like a misplaced musical. Lots of quirky and annoying humor like one should expect in an MCU film.The Skrulls are in the film and as a fan we always think we can write the better film after watching it, but I just DO NOT understand why this sequel couldn't have been SECRET INVASION(one of the worst MCU Disney+ shows). SECRET INVASION honestly should have been an Avengers film or at the very least a Captain Marvel sequel co-starring some Avengers, kinda like CIVIL WAR. I personally feel like that dilemma could have furthered Captain Marvel's development due to her involvement with them and how she's equally to blame for not helping them out when she and Fury promised to find them a home. But instead she's stuck with this material.The mid-credit scene is arguably the best part. Once again teasing things to come. It's stuff that like that, that will maybe still garner interest in the MCU despite its current fall from grace. The end-credit scene is alright. Not particularly jazzed about that promise down the line.On that note, the recent Variety article published about Marvel Studios talked about their behind the scenes trouble. It was said that Kevin Feige and his creative committee partook in their yearly Palm Springs retreat to regroup and refocus, so here's hoping to next year being more consistent with quality. Seemed like he was spread too thin with the mandate to have more quantity than quality.THE MARVELS is a season 1.5 for MS. MARVEL and a CAPTAIN MARVEL sequel that we never saw due to the flashbacks and exposition to explain things. And let's be clear, at this point everything feels like homework. That was going to be inevitable moving forward after INFINITY WAR and ENDGAMGE, but especially when Disney+ was announced making Kevin Feige spread out too thin. But it only feels like homework because everything that has been released is below the standard of what Marvel set up for us.So to sum it up, while I did find it slightly more appealing than the first CAPTAIN MARVEL and QUANTUMANIA, that isn't saying much. Low expectations definitely helped. Is THE MARVELS one of the worst? No, but it definitely belongs way down below the list.5/10."
"Marvels","tibby_23","17 January 2024",410,"By far the worst Marvel movie so far, I am extremely disappointed. After the mess that Thor 4 was, I was hoping that Marvel learned its lesson, but it seems not. I am honestly happy this movie did bad at the box office, that's what you get for ruining such a great character (I loved Cpt. Marvel from the comics).What makes it bad:
Action moves way too fast from one scene to anotherNo character improvement or growth by the end of the movieThings just happen with no storytellingNot serious enough, too childish for my tasteToo many goofy moments (singing, really? We've come this low, Marvel?)End scenes that try to set the context for next movies seem forced and unnecessaryI also found two good things eventually:
I liked the villain and her story, sympathized with her a bitAt least the movie was not long.These writers should never be hired again."
"Marvels","olcare","10 November 2023",410,"Criticizing specific parts of the movie became confusing for me as there were so many details I wanted to change. This film truly disappointed me, especially since my expectations were already low, and falling below them is a bad sign for Marvel. It had a Thor: Love and Thunder vibe, which I also disliked (4/10). I had been excited after watching Loki in the morning, but it was in vain.For me, the unbearable part was the music. After checking the playlists of movies I've watched for a long time, Marvel had by far the worst compositions. The music was exaggerated, drowning out the impact of fight scenes and making them unbearable. It was like overly noisy background music during a break.Another aspect I didn't like was the main villain. I can't believe Marvel fell into the same mistake again. The villain was poorly written, and Zawe Ashton's performance felt forced, appearing awkward in scenes. One major reason for this was the poor portrayal of the Kree Empire in the MCU. Neglecting the significance of the Kree made Supreme look bad. They could have explained the critical situation of the 'Hala' planet in the film's opening with a 30-35 minute sequence, providing context for the desperation of the Kree.Another thing I found absurd was Monica teleporting to a parallel universe. They portrayed the concept of parallel universes like child's play. Especially after watching Loki Season 2 in the morning, her randomly teleporting or getting stuck in another universe seemed too simplistic.Seeing Professor Beast was surprising and pleasing. The X-Men era is beginning, and despite the poor productions, I'm excited. Brie Larson was good again, carrying her character well. The scene with Monica, Kamala, Danvers vs Dar-Benn was good, thankfully without music. However, despite not being a fan of Kamala Khan, her origin is preserved, and it's not bad. But I feel there's a lack of harmony among our main three characters, and I believe it's a script issue, not an actor one.While I like the idea of saving a planet by traveling through different planets, I didn't like the execution at all. Presenting such a serious and contemporary issue as if it's the simplest thing with childlike music seems somewhat unserious to me.However it turns out, this film paved the way for others and served as a stepping stone. Hopefully, with Beast in Deadpool 3, the overall MCU storyline will improve, abandoning mediocrity urgently; otherwise, it will continue to receive poor ratings.Note: I forgot to mention in the review, but Goose is a fantastic character, and I hope we continue to see this adorable cat. The scene with all the cats was genuinely entertaining, one of the enjoyable moments in 4-5 scenes."
"Marvels","alensufli","8 November 2023",210,"Even writing a review is extremely pointless as we all knew what we were expecting months before but here I am. They even themselves admitted it. The film is a huge disappointment. The plot is all over the place. Actions sequences were sometimes good but sometime were so dumb I didn't know where to look, where to pay attention. I like how they tried to catch the old marvel magic. Yes. They tried. But they utterly failed. Feige pulled off ""wait until the post credit scene to get excited cuz the film itself is boring"" trick again. And it wasn't a ""wow"" for me at least. The theatre was silent throughout and after the film. No one even made a giggling sound. Dead silence. Jokes were landing facedown to the ground every time a character made one. That's right. Every character there is comic relief. And I absolutely don't wanna talk about acting."
"Marvels","S3pt3m63r","18 November 2023",NA,"Unfortunately if you haven't got Disney plus and you don't keep to speed with the tv series, then you this movie won't make much sense as it relies on you knowing what's going on in that universe so far, which I'm not up to date with and involves the Miss Marvels characters which haven't been introduced in the movies. Confusing.I had hoped that following Guardians 3 it could've get much worse for the Marvel universe, at least Guardians has Rocket😂It's hard to find any plot to this movie. Carol Danvers (Captain Marvel) does throw a lot of people through the roof but the plot is a quantum entanglement mess. The movie is blissfully short but feels longer as it's so bad and some people walked out of the theatre. I was so pleasantly when it ended.I think it's about to retire the whole Marvel superhero franchise as this phase is going badly."
"Marvels","nscoby93","10 November 2023",210,"I actually had no intention of watching this film in theaters. Originally, I was just going to wait for its home release on Disney Plus, but after recently rewatching WandaVision, I genuinely wanted to see how they would handle Monica Rambeau and see what they would do with her.So I'll mention the positives for this film first...The movie is actually pretty, I really enjoyed the film aesthetically it looked good. This is very surprising to say as recent Marvel projects are tremendous eye sores.The films central characters, Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) and Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani), were surprisingly good. I had fully anticipated to dislike Captain Marvel and Ms Marvel in this film but I surprisingly enjoyed them both which is a big compliment coming from me, and Monica Rambeau is my favorite of the three she was good as I expected and anticipated. All three actresses gave enjoyable performances, and they all worked well together on screen.Then, of course, Samuel Jackson is always great! And the return of everyone's favorite Flerken kitty Goose. She had a great sequence that I refuse to spoil, but it had me dying. Goose saved this film!And well that's it...This film is just bad. Bad writing, bad pacing, bad storytelling. Nothing in this film is properly set up as it rushes through its 1 hour and 45 minute run time. Which is quite frankly fine for me as I genuinely did not want more of this.This movie as a whole is just overwhelmingly safe. It has no stakes, takes no risks, and does nothing. But there is actual enjoyment in its failings. It was so bad that it was good. The amount of eye rolling, face palms, and sighs I gave through this film was astonishing. I gave up on this film within the first 30 minutes, and afterward, that's when the enjoyment began because of how bad it went on to be.Then suddenly, out of nowhere, the film became a musical? Like what is happening? This film is so chaotic and unstructured. It just never stopped.The film had a good mid-credit scene so you know stay for that. Unfortunately, it was spoiled for me, so it didn't hit as hard as it could have. Especially if you're a fan of the actor who originally played the character the scene introduces.But The Marvels was exactly what I anticipated it to be, a below average dump. Which is a shame because they play with some interesting concepts in this film, but they do nothing with them, or they are just poorly handled. I can at least say I didn't hate this movie. Unfortunately, I just enjoyed it for all the wrong reasons.IMDb: 3/10

"Marvels","brentsbulletinboard","11 November 2023",510,"When I first heard the title of this movie, I thought it was about a 1960s girls' singing group. And, frankly, that would have probably made for a better movie. Writer-director Nia DaCosta's third feature outing and the latest in the Marvel Universe paradigm is a wildly inconsistent superhero movie that tries too hard to do too much and doesn't have a script to support it. Too many of its plot elements aren't adequately explained until well into the story, while others aren't explained at all, leaving viewers who aren't comic book laureates wondering what's going on (particularly at film's end). Meanwhile, other narrative aspects frequently appear gimmicky and grow old quickly, such as the introduction of the primary superpower that its three protagonists share, one that almost becomes slapstickish after an all-too-brief while. On top of that, the CGI effects vacillate from one end of the quality spectrum to the other, creating a mix of images that are either startling to look at or stunningly cheesy at best. Add to that a villain that isn't particularly menacing, along with attempts at humor that either succeed brilliantly (cat lovers take note) or fall flat and look incredibly lame (as aficionados of musical theater will undoubtedly attest), all of which further add to the picture's pervasive inconsistency. The inclusion of ample clues for advancing the overarching Marvel Universe storyline continues here, too, furthering a trend that's growing tiresome in the studio's releases, a development akin to the ""Paul is dead"" legacy come to life with every passing picture. Then there's the trio of heroes themselves, who often appear more like they've been plucked from a giddy slumber party flick or a Cyndi Lauper video than taking center stage as seriously empowered champions in an action-adventure offering. All of these failings combine to make this production more of a forgettable placeholder in the Marvel mythology than a standalone feature (not to mention a pale substitute for a sequel to the far-superior film that launched the Captain Marvel franchise in 2019). In short, ""The Marvels"" is as much of a mess as it is a movie, and that's troubling for several reasons. It lends credence to the growing criticism that films like this aren't to be taken seriously. It reinforces the notion that they're cookie-cutter in nature, easily interchangeable with one another. And it raises questions about the career choices of lead actress Brie Larson, who, though quite capable of playing roles like these, is running the risk of becoming type-cast, a troubling prospect for an Academy Award-winning actress who possesses a depth of talent and is handily adept at taking on better and more serious material than this. In the wake of this release, Marvel Studios should take a step back and seriously assess where its future is headed, especially if movies like this are any indication. As pictures like ""Wakanda Forever"" (2022) show, the studio is capable of better work - and it's time to show viewers that."
"Marvels","Sleepin_Dragon","10 November 2023",410,"Carol Danvers is attempting to save the universe, but her incredible powers become entangled with those of Kamala Khan and Monica Rambeau, they must unite to save the world.Ouch, what can you say, this is surely one of Marvel's lowest points, I honestly don't know who the target audience is, or who this is going to appeal to, young teens only maybe? Anyhow, this was an absolute mess.The writing was clearly problematic, it doesn't gel, it is genuinely all over the place. I do very much wonder if huge sections of this film cut? It can be the only answer, it just doesn't flow at all, and that short run time...Special effects, some were pretty good, some were poor, I just wish there was a greater focus on plot, it just seemed like 100 minutes of CGI, noise and random events.Brie Larson, I'm not sure about you, but to me she looked totally disinterested and bored by the whole thing, what I didn't see, was someone committed to the role. I thought Samuel Jackson was rather good, but again poorly served by the script.It didn't look great from the trailers, and in reality, it's another clunker from Marvel Studios.4/10."

For me I was hoping for something that children and adults could enjoy. But, no only kids will enjoy this silly mess.I enjoyed the Captain Marvel movie and thought the criticism was not warranted. I also loved Wanda Vision and the introduction of Monica Rambeau and I was hoping for at least a good continuation of her story. I didn't watch Ms. Marvel because I'm not a teen and I knew it wasn't for me; and after watching her parts in this movie I'm glad I stuck to that.All three actresses are good and of course Samuel L in always a pleasure to see, but none of the other characters including the so-called villain were the least bit interesting. Most of the scenes were just downright silly. I hope they continue Monica's story with better writing and I wish Marvel would stop being silly and go back to making movies for adults and kids."
"Marvels","isaacsundaralingam","11 November 2023",310,"The MCU has absolutely overstayed its welcome. Post Avengers Endgame, these projects have been feeling more and more like content than cinema (except the rare surprises like GOTG 3). Superhero fatigue, they call it and this movie does practically nothing but to amp it up to 11.You watch the trailer, you know what happens. You bet on originality, you end up homeless. There's nothing new for me to say that I haven't already said about any of the other MCU content as of late. It's so generic that I'm confident a year from now, no one would remember this movie even existed. With every new MCU project, the jokes-per-minute ratio keeps getting worse, the villains are a writer's version of a stock photograph (I can't even remember the villain's name in this movie and it hasn't even been a day since I watched it), the CGI is so out there you can almost see the CGI artists' tears on screen, and it's getting more and more difficult to tell each MCU project apart cos they're all just the same.The only few positives I can identify here are actresses Iman Vellani and Brie Larson (Larson, who seems much more relaxed and settled into her superhero boots), and maybe the flashy action sequences. Otherwise, there's nothing here to watch, nothing here to experience and nothing here to enjoy. What a shame."
"Marvels","MrDHWong","9 November 2023",410,"""The Marvels"" is the sequel to 2019's ""Captain Marvel"", a continuation of the Disney+ series ""Ms. Marvel"", and the 33rd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris, and Iman Vellani, it represents a painful look at the downward spiral the MCU has found itself caught in since the end of Phase 3.Sometime after the events of ""Captain Marvel"", Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) has unintentionally started a civil war among the alien race known as the Kree. The leader of the Kree, Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton), soon finds one half of the Quantum Bands and later seeks out the other half, which is in the possession of Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel (Iman Vellani). At the request of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Carol teams up with Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) to negotiate peace among the Kree, but as the two investigate a wormhole in outer space, Monica, Carol, and Kamala start mysteriously switching powers with one another. Realising something is amiss, the trio are forced to work together to figure out what is causing this strange phenomena and hopefully put a stop to both Dar-Benn and the warring Kree.It's becoming harder and harder to call myself fan of the MCU, given the array of serviceable to terrible projects they have been churning out lately. To be fair though, it is a tall order to top something as ambitious as the culmination of over ten years worth of universe building after both ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and ""Avengers: Endgame"" pulled it off so effectively years ago. For the longest time, I have been willing to defend the post-Endgame MCU for trying different things, as I was under the impression that all of this would be leading to exciting new projects on the horizon. However, after sitting through ""The Marvels"", I can say with a hint of heartbreak that practically all of my optimism for the MCU's future has all but disappeared, as it contains next to nothing worth defending from a creative standpoint.Perhaps the best way to describe my viewing experience with this film would be ""apathetic"", because at no point does it ever feel like anything important is at stake. This is mainly due to either our three heroes being too overpowered or there not being enough information provided about the ones who need saving. Whenever a horde of enemies are swarming the trio, we watch as the three of them effortlessly take them out without even breaking a sweat. Action-packed moments like these that once elicited excitement have now been reduced to a series of bland fistfights and generic CGI blasts that have all been done before in better MCU films.We see Carol Danvers quickly blast everyone away with her energy beams and block punches with her hands, never once showing any signs that she is in real danger. Her accomplice Monica Rambeau does pretty much the same thing, only with less time on screen. Even Kamala Khan, who is the biggest fish-out-of-water in this situation, has no major trouble dealing with foes coming at her from every angle, always using her half of the Quantum Band to her advantage. How is it possible to keep the audience on their toes if the enemy forces are so inefficient that even an inexperienced child can wipe the floor with them this easily? On that note, it also doesn't help that none of these three heroes appear to have any physical weaknesses or personal insecurities holding them back, which causes all of the tension to evaporate instantly.In addition to this, we are barely shown anything interesting about the Kree that will keep the audience invested in their role in the story. As far as the film is concerned, they are nothing more than a stock species of extraterrestrials that are causing problems simply because the plot demands it. The original ""Captain Marvel"" film established that the Kree were the ones who inadvertently gave Carol her powers and took her in among them. Yet, this film never reminds the audience of that, instead opting to throw them right into the thick of the conflict without any important context. As a result, I just did not care at all about what happened to any of these people.It's also worth mentioning that this film is rife with obvious re-edits and tonal inconsistencies. One scene where this is most evident is where Carol Danvers is opening up to both Rambeau and Khan about her relationship with the Kree. What could have been a good method of showcasing Danvers's humanity is instead brushed aside for something completely unrelated after less than two minutes. I couldn't help but assume that this scene was supposed to go on much longer but was cut in post production for whatever reason. To add insult to injury, the scene is then immediately followed by a strange attempt at comic relief which fails to raise even a single laugh. Although Marvel films are known for their blending of comedy with drama, a moment like this felt like a rather tacky addition to the film that only hampers the already poor narrative structure. Worse still, there are other similar occurrences like this throughout the rest of the story.One of the biggest problems with the original ""Captain Marvel"" film was how weakly written the title character was, with her lack of likeable character traits and overly serious demeanour being a major reason why she is not viewed favourably by fans. You'd expect the filmmakers to remedy this problem for the sequel, but you would be wrong. I'm not sure whether it's Brie Larson's underwhelming performance or just plain old bad writing but I have never once felt any fondness for Carol Danvers as a person. As mentioned above, she efficiently fights her way through many bad guys with no issue whatsoever, never once showing any emotional weakness or other potential vulnerabilities. Because of this, Carol Danvers never feels like a real person, being nothing more than a one-dimensional superhero that is practically impossible for anybody to identify with. Her character has not changed or grown since the first film, and it looks like she won't be doing so anytime soon.I keep trying to remind myself of Monica Rambeau's contribution to the story but nothing memorable ever comes to mind without doing some kind of online research. Like Brie Larson, there is nothing especially remarkable about Teyonah Parris's performance, as her character is as bland as she comes. Though it is established that Rambeau looked up to Carol Danvers as a child, her role in this story is nothing more than playing second fiddle to an already dull lead protagonist. Yes, Rambeau is very strong and yes, she is more than capable of taking care of herself in a fight, but beyond that what else does she offer? Most of the time she just goes along with Danvers's orders without ever questioning her or giving her personal opinions, making her nothing more than a blind follower. I was hoping to have seen some kind of opposing dynamic between Danvers and Rambeau, as that would have given their characters an important amount of depth the distinguish the two from one another. No such luck I'm afraid.The only character I sort of cared about was Kamala Khan, whose childlike naiveté made her the most relatable of the three leads. In her feature film debut, Iman Vellani does carry over many of Khan's human traits from the Disney+ series ""Ms. Marvel"", being that she's still young and coming to terms with mastering her powers. Unfortunately, she does not achieve this through the character herself, but rather due to how woefully underwritten her two co-stars are in comparison. I wanted to see the three as kindred spirits, fighting as trio but standing out as individuals. Instead, all we get are two dull, stoic, overpowered adults and a young kid working together for no other reason than because the writers said so.As depressing as it sounds, the once mighty MCU is showing no signs of improvement as ""The Marvels"" just may be the worst film in the series so far. There simply isn't enough reason to justify its existence outside of some kind of contractual obligation by the higher ups at Disney, and I fully respect many people's decision to skip it altogether. At this point, I seriously doubt the MCU can ever return to its former glory, as this film is set to become the series' biggest box office bomb to date. I can only hope in vain that Disney will learn an important lesson from this film's failure, but knowing their track record that seems unlikely.I rate it 4/10."
"Marvels","danieljfarthing","9 January 2024",110,"2019's ""Captain Marvel"" wasn't too bad, for a superhero movie, but its sequel ""The Marvels"" is an unmitigated stinking disaster - the WORST Marvel movie to date (which is saying something). Set a decade or two after the original, Brie Larson (via Samuel L Jackson) teams somewhat inadvertently with Teyonah Parris & Iman Vellani (awful) to save Gary Lewis' people (what happened to previous leader Ben Mendelsohn?!) from evil Zawe Ashton. Director Nia DaCosta (who also co-wrote this tripe with Megan McDonnell & Elissa Karasik) creates a headache inducing, fast (as if bizarrely sped up), frantic, thoroughly annoying, tiresome piece of garbage. Absolutely dreadful."
"Marvels","altugozhan","12 November 2023",210,"I just want to know who is responsible for MCUs phase 4 and how he or she can still be employedThere are 0(zero) good movies and only 1 or 2 tv shows that are watchable over a total of 20 productions and this is one of the bottom ranked ones. Marvel did a fantastic job over the decade, earned trust of fans besides billions of dollars and they are wasting it like there is no tomorrow.I don't know how a franchise can change so drastically from hero to zero.I have watched every marvel movie out there and this is equally as bad as she-hulk.Story is definitely boring, protagonists are boring, antagonist is boring, action is boring, battles are boring, some scenes are absurd and ridiculous.I have absolutely nothing good to say about this movie. Don't waste your money or your time.Looks like the movie is only made to make money in India."
"Marvels","ThereelscoopwithKK","10 November 2023",110,"This second installment makes the original Captain Marvel look like a cinematic masterpiece... Nothing about this movie works. Although Brie Larson's acting has improved over the years it feels like she doesn't want to be there for this at all. Further, when you break it down, there is really no story at all happening. In fact, the solution to the entire problem is so extremely simple and solvable that you really wonder why there was a conflict in the first place. So much of everything is unexplained and eventually you stop trying to figure it out because you eventually lose all interest . Samuel L Jackson's character , Nick Fury, is hardly even a shell of his former self and is essentially now demoted to comedic relief.The scenes don't really mesh together at all. None of them are really necessary to advancing a plot and all feature the same repeated choreographic battle. The villain lacks any real charisma and is only provided a very brief backstory. Overall she never feels like too much of a threat.There's one part in particular that I think is absolutely a candidate for worst sequence of 2023. Without spoiling it , it is essentially a planet that looks like a cheap rip off of the Wizard of Oz. It just captures all of the problems with this movie into one scene. There's been a lot of less than stellar work from Marvel since endgame, but this is reaching new depths.I'm not even going to get started on the cats scene with the theme song....Please Loki, reset the entire timeline."
"Marvels","Avwillfan89","23 December 2023",110,"This film is somehow way more depressing and worse than Ant Man Quantumania. We honestly thought Eternals was bad, but that was only the beginning. It was only going to go downhill from there.Watching this movie felt like watching a beloved friend in a coma fighting for her life. It was sad, frustrating and ultimately hopeless. So much potential squandered right before our very eyes.Much has been said about the Girl Power aspect of this story, but it doesn't mean jack when the characters are so thinly written. After the big character tension build up between Carol and Monica, with the latter resenting her for not coming back, their fractures mend themselves very quickly. There is no chemistry between the the two at all.The villain is Bland with a capitol B, and highly forgettable.Nick Fury is actually pathetic in this movie. He doesn't at all act like the Fury we know and love. He was more in character in Far From Home when Talos was impersonating him!I don't think I've ever had this much of a bad experience with a film since Cats. And it is telling that there actually features a ludicrous scene involving baby flerkens and the song Memory.What the actual hell, Marvel?The only good thing is that it is mercifully short, and Iman Vellani does seem to be enjoying herself in the role.Once a great studio, brought crumbling down on itself. If I could give it zero stars, I would."
"Marvels","chenp-54708","10 November 2023",210,"Marvel movies really have fallen apart haven't they? This is definitely one of the worst Marvels movie I have seen out of all the Marvel movies I had watched. There really isn't too much to say about the movie because ""The Marvels"" is pretty much like almost every single Marvel movie but the writing, humor, direction, and performances are pretty much all over the place. Director Nia DaCosta has made ""Little Woods"" which I liked but her direction here is pretty bad and goes all over the place.The special effects are kind of rough on the edges, the actions and thrills were just okay and the performances, despite a pretty good cast, they aren't very good. Brie Larson is an actress I like but unfortunately her performance felt weak and lacking. The other performances as well including the child performances. The story isn't interesting as the writing is pretty bland and none of the characters were interesting. With a short runtime, the movie surprisingly was really boring.I do like superhero movies but it seems this one really just sucked. Overall, it's bad."
"Marvels","kevin_robbins","12 November 2023",310,"My wife and I recently caught Marvel's (2023) in theaters. The plot revolves around Captain Marvel's mistake in choosing sides during a battle, disrupting the cosmic balance. Two young ladies gain powers in the process, and Captain Marvel must collaborate with them to rectify her error and restore equilibrium to the universe.Directed by Nia DaCosta (Candyman) and featuring Brie Larson (Lessons in Chemistry), Teyonah Parris (Dear White People), Iman Vellani (Ms. Marvel), Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction), and Zawe Ashton (Blitz).This film boasts clean and classic Marvel-style characters, cinematography, action scenes, and special effects. However, the plot seems somewhat lackluster, with Captain Marvel possibly appearing more as a villain than a hero. The backstories of the heroes lack sufficient development, making it challenging to form a connection with them. The cat steals the show initially but feels overdone by the end, and even Samuel L. Jackson's wit falls short of expectations.In summary, this superhero movie prioritizes its message over a compelling storyline. While the characters and visuals are in line with Marvel's trademark style, the plot may leave audiences indifferent. The lack of character depth and an engaging storyline earns this film a 3/10, making it a skip-worthy experience."
"Marvels","SHU_Movies","10 November 2023",310,"Going from the Loki Series Finale this morning to The Marvels this evening was (for lack of a better word) bonkers! The finale was perfect, and a beautiful ending to the show, while The Marvels is a complete mess. It's honestly given me whiplashThe Marvels is just an all-around bad movie. The script is awful and the story is super rushed and poorly executed, which both have an impact on how well the characters (and in-turn the actors) come-across on-screenThe action and humour are kind of alright, and the VFX are definitely better than anything we've seen in an MCU project since Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness (with the obvious exceptions of Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 and Loki Season 2), but that still doesn't exactly make it look greatThis movie is just painful to watch at points! Early on, it has some really fun moments, and felt like it could have actually been somewhat entertaining, but that feeling vanished as soon as it came. It's barley better than Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania, so you can do with that information what you will."
"Marvels","NanoFrog","16 January 2024",110,"So Stan Lee passes away and we get Disney now in full control of Marvel stories...and boy is there a difference. I could not finish watching this really bad film, it is just junk from scene to scene. The cast, I feel so sorry for them because the cast is a fine group for the most part...but the story, the effects, the directing are all jumbled up into a real mess. The premise is interesting but they have no idea what to do with it. I have never been a fan of Disney, maybe when I was 10 years old, back in the early 60s, but this is not at all Walt Disney. This is Disney INC and a massive number of talentless paperwork and book-keepers make their films these days. This is just junk slammed together by people who have no idea how to tell a story or stage intelligent effects. This film is not a Turkey, it is, in fact, just garbage. RIP MArvel."
"Marvels","OnlyAtJMart","12 November 2023",410,"Anyone who heard the news about this project knows that the production was a nightmare, and it shows in the final product here. It's like they couldn't figure out what direction to go, so they made 4 versions, and blended them together. Which would explain the high budget, the 5 delays, and the reshoots. Kamala's character was probably the best part of the movie. I promise you, the script did her no favors, but she stood out. Her acting was in line with her character. This was probably an exciting opportunity for her, and she wasn't going to let a bad script, and production problems stop her from giving a great effort. However, the story, the dialogue, the musical gimmick, the weak villain. It just didn't work. I don't think the blame lies solely with the actors, or even the director, who did lack the experience for helming a movie with a budget this size. I think Disney interfered heavily with the production, which almost always yields bad results. I think it was doomed to fail. They put so much pressure on this being successful, they forgot to make it coherent, unique, or interesting."
"Marvels","mildlyintrusive","13 November 2023",210,"Once in a while I tend to go to my local theater to check out something new, maybe a new release or a re-run of a movie. Today, I stumbled upon The Marvels, I thought ""Hey, I haven't been going to the theater this month that often, maybe I should try this out?"" And well, it seems that I'd made the wrong decision. The Marvels follows the titular Marvels trying to stop an evil Kree with one disadvantage however, every time they use their powers, it's Freaky Friday.Maybe its because of the very troubled production but everything just feels like an amalgamation of three separate movies, its like a ADHD experience. The movie does NOT take itself seriously at all, and as a result, it makes me hard to care for literally everything! Its like a circus act masquerading as a movie, it doesn't work! There were moments where characters were in danger and they start joking about it every opportunity they get. To add insult to injury was the treatment of the character of Nick Fury, who feels like a completely different character altogether, cracking lame after lame jokes every single time! Special effects were decent, but considering the massive 271M+ budget I wished they could've at least cared about the plot and flesh out some if the characters and their motivations instead of relying on action scene after action scene, it gets tiring after a while you know?Brie Larson herself looks tired and forced in this movie, her character also being this girl-boss who can sweep through enemies in this movie, no weaknesses and no vulnerabilities. It all feels so one-dimensional, it tries to be like a 80s action star with the likes of Arnold and co. But fails because they lack charisma and charm. Because of this I found it impossible to relate to her in any sense of way. Monica Rambeau wasn't trying her best here, and there is no opposing dynamic between the two to the point where I found her virtually indistinguishable from Mrs. Danvers herself. However I do commend Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan, whose child-like personality I was comfortable with and is the standout between the three leads but suffers from being very underwritten and the villain is a copy-and-paste from dozens we've seen before.Overall, a messy and disjointed movie with not much to offer rather than annoying, dreadful humor and some few flashy action scenes. It certainly feels like homework for the MCU as it struggles to keep a hook in something after the Infinity Saga. Skip this one and play with your action figures instead, Im sure it'll be better than this."
"Marvels","critic-97-417657","4 February 2024",810,"The movie was somewhat ridiculous, but I found myself giggling throughout it. It was actually quite fun. There were a lot of really charming things about this movie, and while the storyline lacked any real tension, I didn't really care. It was mostly about the character development, and the relationships between the three main characters. Overall, I just found it really fun and just didn't take it very seriously. In a lot of ways, it is a set up for the rest of the series, and is definitely not a standalone movie. And the post credit scene, amazing. Ties in a lot of potential for what they are going to be doing in this franchise."
"Marvels","The-Sarkologist","7 February 2024",710,"Well, I guess someone was right when they said that one of the big problems with this film was that you had to like watch 8 other films and 3 series to sort of understand what was going on. Mind you, I have actually done just that, but even then with the amount of time that had passed since I watched the other things it was still a little tricky understanding what was happening.Mind you, I did actually quite like the film. Like the scenes where they were switching places whenever they used their powers together, and also the big bad in the film, that was in part trying to save her people, but also attempting to punish Captain Marvel for what she had done to her people. Yeah, as it turned out, when she destroyed the great intelligence it sent the Kree into a massive civil war which basically destroyed their planet.So, if you had seen Miss Marvel, you will know that she has a thing for Captain Marvel, and of course it was always going to be a thing that she was eventually going to be involved in a team up. Also, there were some hints at the end that suggested that there was going to be another team-up film, though apparently that will still be some way off (and the problem will be that, no doubt, when they get around to it, all of them will be too old to be members of a possible Young Avengers - kids do grow up a little too fast).Yeah, I thought that this film was pretty good, though I have to agree that the problem is that you do need to catch up to speed to understand what is going on. Oh, it also seemed that it felt that it was a bit over the place, no doubt because they wanted to make the film shorter than a lot of the others. Still, it's good, especially if you are up to date on the films."
"Marvels","cherold","30 January 2024",710,"After the bad reviews, and considering how many bad superhero movies have come out lately, I would have skipped this one if the trailer didn't look like so much fun. Fortunately, the movie fulfills the trailer's promiseIn the movie, three superheroes with related powers find themselves suddenly swapping places with one another. The proves to be a good gimmick for both action and comedy, as the three keep finding themselves in one another's battles. Eventually, they master the situation in order to take down a very angry villain with an unusually sympathetic backstory.The movie leans heavily - and for the most part successfully - into the comedy. A big chunk of this is fueled by the teenage Captain Marvel fangirl Ms. Marvel, who is from a TV series I found too pre-teen-oriented to enjoy. Ms. Marvel's an annoying character but for the most part I found her amusing in this.There's also a funny gag with alien cats.While I enjoyed this movie, I have to admit its a bit of an unfocussed mess. There are a lot of elements just tossed in, like a whole thing with Marvel #3, Monica, dealing with her abandonment issues. These occasional ""emotional"" moments don't much interest me.Anyway, a lot of people hate this, but if you like the trailer, I'd say chance the movie (I did not take a chance on the last Aquaman movie because unlike The Marvels, the trailer looked just as bad as people said the movie was.Going against the current, I say if you want a bunch of comedy and some fun action then you should watch this one."
"Marvels","drawlife","8 November 2023",510,"THE MARVELS is here and it's a mashed up film that is totally all over the place. It feels as if this film was edited and chopped into pieces during post and it shows.Couple things I enjoyed, I did like seeing Carol Danvers and Monica Rambeau resolve and acknowledge their relationship, but due to the nature of their characters being straight arrows, it allows Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan to be the audience just as Tom Holland's Peter Parker was in CIVIL WAR. I did not particularly enjoy the MS. MARVEL series, but I can see her being the shoutout for many.I think the script just touched on the surface of Brie Larson's Captain Marvel herself, so diving into her more is a plus, however the story did her no favors once again and I did feel like she was given like four or five pieces of direction to portray her character compared to the more one-note performance in the first film. Teyonah Parris is commendable. She was the more science-y of the trio.Samuel L. Jackson just feels inconsistent especially after SECRET INVASION. Feels like this Nick Fury is a variant. He's simply passing through in this film.Another thing I liked was the incursions (also briefly touched on in DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS). We all complained about the lack of planting seeds for the future leading into KANG DYNASTY and SECRET WARS. Finally, this film it at least preps and teases what's to come down the line.The MCU's villain problem is a long known fact, but here it only cements their problem even further. Now I'm a fan of Lee Pace's over the top performance as Ronan, but Dar-Benn played by Zawe Ashton is literally a copy and paste of Ronan, but female. Nothing new about it. Definitely up there as one of the worst villains in the MCU.The power swaps were kinda cool so I can give it that. Nia DaCosta does a good job executing the fight scenes, but again as one should expect, VFX is meh. Now if you cringed during the musical note duel between the two Doctor Strange, then wait till you see one segment of the film where it feels like a misplaced musical. Lots of quirky and annoying humor like one should expect in an MCU film.The Skrulls are in the film and as a fan we always think we can write the better film after watching it, but I just DO NOT understand why this sequel couldn't have been SECRET INVASION(one of the worst MCU Disney+ shows). SECRET INVASION honestly should have been an Avengers film or at the very least a Captain Marvel sequel co-starring some Avengers, kinda like CIVIL WAR. I personally feel like that dilemma could have furthered Captain Marvel's development due to her involvement with them and how she's equally to blame for not helping them out when she and Fury promised to find them a home. But instead she's stuck with this material.The mid-credit scene is arguably the best part. Once again teasing things to come. It's stuff that like that, that will maybe still garner interest in the MCU despite its current fall from grace. The end-credit scene is alright. Not particularly jazzed about that promise down the line.On that note, the recent Variety article published about Marvel Studios talked about their behind the scenes trouble. It was said that Kevin Feige and his creative committee partook in their yearly Palm Springs retreat to regroup and refocus, so here's hoping to next year being more consistent with quality. Seemed like he was spread too thin with the mandate to have more quantity than quality.THE MARVELS is a season 1.5 for MS. MARVEL and a CAPTAIN MARVEL sequel that we never saw due to the flashbacks and exposition to explain things. And let's be clear, at this point everything feels like homework. That was going to be inevitable moving forward after INFINITY WAR and ENDGAMGE, but especially when Disney+ was announced making Kevin Feige spread out too thin. But it only feels like homework because everything that has been released is below the standard of what Marvel set up for us.So to sum it up, while I did find it slightly more appealing than the first CAPTAIN MARVEL and QUANTUMANIA, that isn't saying much. Low expectations definitely helped. Is THE MARVELS one of the worst? No, but it definitely belongs way down below the list.5/10."
"Marvels","tibby_23","17 January 2024",410,"By far the worst Marvel movie so far, I am extremely disappointed. After the mess that Thor 4 was, I was hoping that Marvel learned its lesson, but it seems not. I am honestly happy this movie did bad at the box office, that's what you get for ruining such a great character (I loved Cpt. Marvel from the comics).What makes it bad:
Action moves way too fast from one scene to anotherNo character improvement or growth by the end of the movieThings just happen with no storytellingNot serious enough, too childish for my tasteToo many goofy moments (singing, really? We've come this low, Marvel?)End scenes that try to set the context for next movies seem forced and unnecessaryI also found two good things eventually:
I liked the villain and her story, sympathized with her a bitAt least the movie was not long.These writers should never be hired again."
"Marvels","olcare","10 November 2023",410,"Criticizing specific parts of the movie became confusing for me as there were so many details I wanted to change. This film truly disappointed me, especially since my expectations were already low, and falling below them is a bad sign for Marvel. It had a Thor: Love and Thunder vibe, which I also disliked (4/10). I had been excited after watching Loki in the morning, but it was in vain.For me, the unbearable part was the music. After checking the playlists of movies I've watched for a long time, Marvel had by far the worst compositions. The music was exaggerated, drowning out the impact of fight scenes and making them unbearable. It was like overly noisy background music during a break.Another aspect I didn't like was the main villain. I can't believe Marvel fell into the same mistake again. The villain was poorly written, and Zawe Ashton's performance felt forced, appearing awkward in scenes. One major reason for this was the poor portrayal of the Kree Empire in the MCU. Neglecting the significance of the Kree made Supreme look bad. They could have explained the critical situation of the 'Hala' planet in the film's opening with a 30-35 minute sequence, providing context for the desperation of the Kree.Another thing I found absurd was Monica teleporting to a parallel universe. They portrayed the concept of parallel universes like child's play. Especially after watching Loki Season 2 in the morning, her randomly teleporting or getting stuck in another universe seemed too simplistic.Seeing Professor Beast was surprising and pleasing. The X-Men era is beginning, and despite the poor productions, I'm excited. Brie Larson was good again, carrying her character well. The scene with Monica, Kamala, Danvers vs Dar-Benn was good, thankfully without music. However, despite not being a fan of Kamala Khan, her origin is preserved, and it's not bad. But I feel there's a lack of harmony among our main three characters, and I believe it's a script issue, not an actor one.While I like the idea of saving a planet by traveling through different planets, I didn't like the execution at all. Presenting such a serious and contemporary issue as if it's the simplest thing with childlike music seems somewhat unserious to me.However it turns out, this film paved the way for others and served as a stepping stone. Hopefully, with Beast in Deadpool 3, the overall MCU storyline will improve, abandoning mediocrity urgently; otherwise, it will continue to receive poor ratings.Note: I forgot to mention in the review, but Goose is a fantastic character, and I hope we continue to see this adorable cat. The scene with all the cats was genuinely entertaining, one of the enjoyable moments in 4-5 scenes."
"Marvels","alensufli","8 November 2023",210,"Even writing a review is extremely pointless as we all knew what we were expecting months before but here I am. They even themselves admitted it. The film is a huge disappointment. The plot is all over the place. Actions sequences were sometimes good but sometime were so dumb I didn't know where to look, where to pay attention. I like how they tried to catch the old marvel magic. Yes. They tried. But they utterly failed. Feige pulled off ""wait until the post credit scene to get excited cuz the film itself is boring"" trick again. And it wasn't a ""wow"" for me at least. The theatre was silent throughout and after the film. No one even made a giggling sound. Dead silence. Jokes were landing facedown to the ground every time a character made one. That's right. Every character there is comic relief. And I absolutely don't wanna talk about acting."
"Marvels","S3pt3m63r","18 November 2023",NA,"Unfortunately if you haven't got Disney plus and you don't keep to speed with the tv series, then you this movie won't make much sense as it relies on you knowing what's going on in that universe so far, which I'm not up to date with and involves the Miss Marvels characters which haven't been introduced in the movies. Confusing.I had hoped that following Guardians 3 it could've get much worse for the Marvel universe, at least Guardians has Rocket😂It's hard to find any plot to this movie. Carol Danvers (Captain Marvel) does throw a lot of people through the roof but the plot is a quantum entanglement mess. The movie is blissfully short but feels longer as it's so bad and some people walked out of the theatre. I was so pleasantly when it ended.I think it's about to retire the whole Marvel superhero franchise as this phase is going badly."
"Marvels","nscoby93","10 November 2023",210,"I actually had no intention of watching this film in theaters. Originally, I was just going to wait for its home release on Disney Plus, but after recently rewatching WandaVision, I genuinely wanted to see how they would handle Monica Rambeau and see what they would do with her.So I'll mention the positives for this film first...The movie is actually pretty, I really enjoyed the film aesthetically it looked good. This is very surprising to say as recent Marvel projects are tremendous eye sores.The films central characters, Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) and Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani), were surprisingly good. I had fully anticipated to dislike Captain Marvel and Ms Marvel in this film but I surprisingly enjoyed them both which is a big compliment coming from me, and Monica Rambeau is my favorite of the three she was good as I expected and anticipated. All three actresses gave enjoyable performances, and they all worked well together on screen.Then, of course, Samuel Jackson is always great! And the return of everyone's favorite Flerken kitty Goose. She had a great sequence that I refuse to spoil, but it had me dying. Goose saved this film!And well that's it...This film is just bad. Bad writing, bad pacing, bad storytelling. Nothing in this film is properly set up as it rushes through its 1 hour and 45 minute run time. Which is quite frankly fine for me as I genuinely did not want more of this.This movie as a whole is just overwhelmingly safe. It has no stakes, takes no risks, and does nothing. But there is actual enjoyment in its failings. It was so bad that it was good. The amount of eye rolling, face palms, and sighs I gave through this film was astonishing. I gave up on this film within the first 30 minutes, and afterward, that's when the enjoyment began because of how bad it went on to be.Then suddenly, out of nowhere, the film became a musical? Like what is happening? This film is so chaotic and unstructured. It just never stopped.The film had a good mid-credit scene so you know stay for that. Unfortunately, it was spoiled for me, so it didn't hit as hard as it could have. Especially if you're a fan of the actor who originally played the character the scene introduces.But The Marvels was exactly what I anticipated it to be, a below average dump. Which is a shame because they play with some interesting concepts in this film, but they do nothing with them, or they are just poorly handled. I can at least say I didn't hate this movie. Unfortunately, I just enjoyed it for all the wrong reasons.IMDb: 3/10

Once you get over its not adding anything or revealing any easter eggs, you can enjoy it for what it is.All three main characters deliver on their role, and it improves on captain marvels solo outing. Sit down take any preconceived ideas you have, remove any anticipation of easter eggs and enjoy it for what it is.Has marvel lost its way, yes.

"Marvels","brentsbulletinboard","11 November 2023",510,"When I first heard the title of this movie, I thought it was about a 1960s girls' singing group. And, frankly, that would have probably made for a better movie. Writer-director Nia DaCosta's third feature outing and the latest in the Marvel Universe paradigm is a wildly inconsistent superhero movie that tries too hard to do too much and doesn't have a script to support it. Too many of its plot elements aren't adequately explained until well into the story, while others aren't explained at all, leaving viewers who aren't comic book laureates wondering what's going on (particularly at film's end). Meanwhile, other narrative aspects frequently appear gimmicky and grow old quickly, such as the introduction of the primary superpower that its three protagonists share, one that almost becomes slapstickish after an all-too-brief while. On top of that, the CGI effects vacillate from one end of the quality spectrum to the other, creating a mix of images that are either startling to look at or stunningly cheesy at best. Add to that a villain that isn't particularly menacing, along with attempts at humor that either succeed brilliantly (cat lovers take note) or fall flat and look incredibly lame (as aficionados of musical theater will undoubtedly attest), all of which further add to the picture's pervasive inconsistency. The inclusion of ample clues for advancing the overarching Marvel Universe storyline continues here, too, furthering a trend that's growing tiresome in the studio's releases, a development akin to the ""Paul is dead"" legacy come to life with every passing picture. Then there's the trio of heroes themselves, who often appear more like they've been plucked from a giddy slumber party flick or a Cyndi Lauper video than taking center stage as seriously empowered champions in an action-adventure offering. All of these failings combine to make this production more of a forgettable placeholder in the Marvel mythology than a standalone feature (not to mention a pale substitute for a sequel to the far-superior film that launched the Captain Marvel franchise in 2019). In short, ""The Marvels"" is as much of a mess as it is a movie, and that's troubling for several reasons. It lends credence to the growing criticism that films like this aren't to be taken seriously. It reinforces the notion that they're cookie-cutter in nature, easily interchangeable with one another. And it raises questions about the career choices of lead actress Brie Larson, who, though quite capable of playing roles like these, is running the risk of becoming type-cast, a troubling prospect for an Academy Award-winning actress who possesses a depth of talent and is handily adept at taking on better and more serious material than this. In the wake of this release, Marvel Studios should take a step back and seriously assess where its future is headed, especially if movies like this are any indication. As pictures like ""Wakanda Forever"" (2022) show, the studio is capable of better work - and it's time to show viewers that."
"Marvels","Sleepin_Dragon","10 November 2023",410,"Carol Danvers is attempting to save the universe, but her incredible powers become entangled with those of Kamala Khan and Monica Rambeau, they must unite to save the world.Ouch, what can you say, this is surely one of Marvel's lowest points, I honestly don't know who the target audience is, or who this is going to appeal to, young teens only maybe? Anyhow, this was an absolute mess.The writing was clearly problematic, it doesn't gel, it is genuinely all over the place. I do very much wonder if huge sections of this film cut? It can be the only answer, it just doesn't flow at all, and that short run time...Special effects, some were pretty good, some were poor, I just wish there was a greater focus on plot, it just seemed like 100 minutes of CGI, noise and random events.Brie Larson, I'm not sure about you, but to me she looked totally disinterested and bored by the whole thing, what I didn't see, was someone committed to the role. I thought Samuel Jackson was rather good, but again poorly served by the script.It didn't look great from the trailers, and in reality, it's another clunker from Marvel Studios.4/10."
"Marvels","judywalker2","14 December 2023",510,"Went to see this movie with my 17- and 11-year-old granddaughters. One is a Ms. Marvel fan and the other is now. For me I was hoping for something that children and adults could enjoy. But, no only kids will enjoy this silly mess.I enjoyed the Captain Marvel movie and thought the criticism was not warranted. I also loved Wanda Vision and the introduction of Monica Rambeau and I was hoping for at least a good continuation of her story. I didn't watch Ms. Marvel because I'm not a teen and I knew it wasn't for me; and after watching her parts in this movie I'm glad I stuck to that.All three actresses are good and of course Samuel L in always a pleasure to see, but none of the other characters including the so-called villain were the least bit interesting. Most of the scenes were just downright silly. I hope they continue Monica's story with better writing and I wish Marvel would stop being silly and go back to making movies for adults and kids."
"Marvels","isaacsundaralingam","11 November 2023",310,"The MCU has absolutely overstayed its welcome. Post Avengers Endgame, these projects have been feeling more and more like content than cinema (except the rare surprises like GOTG 3). Superhero fatigue, they call it and this movie does practically nothing but to amp it up to 11.You watch the trailer, you know what happens. You bet on originality, you end up homeless. There's nothing new for me to say that I haven't already said about any of the other MCU content as of late. It's so generic that I'm confident a year from now, no one would remember this movie even existed. With every new MCU project, the jokes-per-minute ratio keeps getting worse, the villains are a writer's version of a stock photograph (I can't even remember the villain's name in this movie and it hasn't even been a day since I watched it), the CGI is so out there you can almost see the CGI artists' tears on screen, and it's getting more and more difficult to tell each MCU project apart cos they're all just the same.The only few positives I can identify here are actresses Iman Vellani and Brie Larson (Larson, who seems much more relaxed and settled into her superhero boots), and maybe the flashy action sequences. Otherwise, there's nothing here to watch, nothing here to experience and nothing here to enjoy. What a shame."
"Marvels","MrDHWong","9 November 2023",410,"""The Marvels"" is the sequel to 2019's ""Captain Marvel"", a continuation of the Disney+ series ""Ms. Marvel"", and the 33rd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris, and Iman Vellani, it represents a painful look at the downward spiral the MCU has found itself caught in since the end of Phase 3.Sometime after the events of ""Captain Marvel"", Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) has unintentionally started a civil war among the alien race known as the Kree. The leader of the Kree, Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton), soon finds one half of the Quantum Bands and later seeks out the other half, which is in the possession of Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel (Iman Vellani). At the request of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Carol teams up with Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) to negotiate peace among the Kree, but as the two investigate a wormhole in outer space, Monica, Carol, and Kamala start mysteriously switching powers with one another. Realising something is amiss, the trio are forced to work together to figure out what is causing this strange phenomena and hopefully put a stop to both Dar-Benn and the warring Kree.It's becoming harder and harder to call myself fan of the MCU, given the array of serviceable to terrible projects they have been churning out lately. To be fair though, it is a tall order to top something as ambitious as the culmination of over ten years worth of universe building after both ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and ""Avengers: Endgame"" pulled it off so effectively years ago. For the longest time, I have been willing to defend the post-Endgame MCU for trying different things, as I was under the impression that all of this would be leading to exciting new projects on the horizon. However, after sitting through ""The Marvels"", I can say with a hint of heartbreak that practically all of my optimism for the MCU's future has all but disappeared, as it contains next to nothing worth defending from a creative standpoint.Perhaps the best way to describe my viewing experience with this film would be ""apathetic"", because at no point does it ever feel like anything important is at stake. This is mainly due to either our three heroes being too overpowered or there not being enough information provided about the ones who need saving. Whenever a horde of enemies are swarming the trio, we watch as the three of them effortlessly take them out without even breaking a sweat. Action-packed moments like these that once elicited excitement have now been reduced to a series of bland fistfights and generic CGI blasts that have all been done before in better MCU films.We see Carol Danvers quickly blast everyone away with her energy beams and block punches with her hands, never once showing any signs that she is in real danger. Her accomplice Monica Rambeau does pretty much the same thing, only with less time on screen. Even Kamala Khan, who is the biggest fish-out-of-water in this situation, has no major trouble dealing with foes coming at her from every angle, always using her half of the Quantum Band to her advantage. How is it possible to keep the audience on their toes if the enemy forces are so inefficient that even an inexperienced child can wipe the floor with them this easily? On that note, it also doesn't help that none of these three heroes appear to have any physical weaknesses or personal insecurities holding them back, which causes all of the tension to evaporate instantly.In addition to this, we are barely shown anything interesting about the Kree that will keep the audience invested in their role in the story. As far as the film is concerned, they are nothing more than a stock species of extraterrestrials that are causing problems simply because the plot demands it. The original ""Captain Marvel"" film established that the Kree were the ones who inadvertently gave Carol her powers and took her in among them. Yet, this film never reminds the audience of that, instead opting to throw them right into the thick of the conflict without any important context. As a result, I just did not care at all about what happened to any of these people.It's also worth mentioning that this film is rife with obvious re-edits and tonal inconsistencies. One scene where this is most evident is where Carol Danvers is opening up to both Rambeau and Khan about her relationship with the Kree. What could have been a good method of showcasing Danvers's humanity is instead brushed aside for something completely unrelated after less than two minutes. I couldn't help but assume that this scene was supposed to go on much longer but was cut in post production for whatever reason. To add insult to injury, the scene is then immediately followed by a strange attempt at comic relief which fails to raise even a single laugh. Although Marvel films are known for their blending of comedy with drama, a moment like this felt like a rather tacky addition to the film that only hampers the already poor narrative structure. Worse still, there are other similar occurrences like this throughout the rest of the story.One of the biggest problems with the original ""Captain Marvel"" film was how weakly written the title character was, with her lack of likeable character traits and overly serious demeanour being a major reason why she is not viewed favourably by fans. You'd expect the filmmakers to remedy this problem for the sequel, but you would be wrong. I'm not sure whether it's Brie Larson's underwhelming performance or just plain old bad writing but I have never once felt any fondness for Carol Danvers as a person. As mentioned above, she efficiently fights her way through many bad guys with no issue whatsoever, never once showing any emotional weakness or other potential vulnerabilities. Because of this, Carol Danvers never feels like a real person, being nothing more than a one-dimensional superhero that is practically impossible for anybody to identify with. Her character has not changed or grown since the first film, and it looks like she won't be doing so anytime soon.I keep trying to remind myself of Monica Rambeau's contribution to the story but nothing memorable ever comes to mind without doing some kind of online research. Like Brie Larson, there is nothing especially remarkable about Teyonah Parris's performance, as her character is as bland as she comes. Though it is established that Rambeau looked up to Carol Danvers as a child, her role in this story is nothing more than playing second fiddle to an already dull lead protagonist. Yes, Rambeau is very strong and yes, she is more than capable of taking care of herself in a fight, but beyond that what else does she offer? Most of the time she just goes along with Danvers's orders without ever questioning her or giving her personal opinions, making her nothing more than a blind follower. I was hoping to have seen some kind of opposing dynamic between Danvers and Rambeau, as that would have given their characters an important amount of depth the distinguish the two from one another. No such luck I'm afraid.The only character I sort of cared about was Kamala Khan, whose childlike naiveté made her the most relatable of the three leads. In her feature film debut, Iman Vellani does carry over many of Khan's human traits from the Disney+ series ""Ms. Marvel"", being that she's still young and coming to terms with mastering her powers. Unfortunately, she does not achieve this through the character herself, but rather due to how woefully underwritten her two co-stars are in comparison. I wanted to see the three as kindred spirits, fighting as trio but standing out as individuals. Instead, all we get are two dull, stoic, overpowered adults and a young kid working together for no other reason than because the writers said so.As depressing as it sounds, the once mighty MCU is showing no signs of improvement as ""The Marvels"" just may be the worst film in the series so far. There simply isn't enough reason to justify its existence outside of some kind of contractual obligation by the higher ups at Disney, and I fully respect many people's decision to skip it altogether. At this point, I seriously doubt the MCU can ever return to its former glory, as this film is set to become the series' biggest box office bomb to date. I can only hope in vain that Disney will learn an important lesson from this film's failure, but knowing their track record that seems unlikely.I rate it 4/10."
"Marvels","danieljfarthing","9 January 2024",110,"2019's ""Captain Marvel"" wasn't too bad, for a superhero movie, but its sequel ""The Marvels"" is an unmitigated stinking disaster - the WORST Marvel movie to date (which is saying something). Set a decade or two after the original, Brie Larson (via Samuel L Jackson) teams somewhat inadvertently with Teyonah Parris & Iman Vellani (awful) to save Gary Lewis' people (what happened to previous leader Ben Mendelsohn?!) from evil Zawe Ashton. Director Nia DaCosta (who also co-wrote this tripe with Megan McDonnell & Elissa Karasik) creates a headache inducing, fast (as if bizarrely sped up), frantic, thoroughly annoying, tiresome piece of garbage. Absolutely dreadful."

Marvel did a fantastic job over the decade, earned trust of fans besides billions of dollars and they are wasting it like there is no tomorrow.I don't know how a franchise can change so drastically from hero to zero.I have watched every marvel movie out there and this is equally as bad as she-hulk.Story is definitely boring, protagonists are boring, antagonist is boring, action is boring, battles are boring, some scenes are absurd and ridiculous.I have absolutely nothing good to say about this movie.

"Marvels","ThereelscoopwithKK","10 November 2023",110,"This second installment makes the original Captain Marvel look like a cinematic masterpiece... Nothing about this movie works. Although Brie Larson's acting has improved over the years it feels like she doesn't want to be there for this at all. Further, when you break it down, there is really no story at all happening. In fact, the solution to the entire problem is so extremely simple and solvable that you really wonder why there was a conflict in the first place. So much of everything is unexplained and eventually you stop trying to figure it out because you eventually lose all interest . Samuel L Jackson's character , Nick Fury, is hardly even a shell of his former self and is essentially now demoted to comedic relief.The scenes don't really mesh together at all. None of them are really necessary to advancing a plot and all feature the same repeated choreographic battle. The villain lacks any real charisma and is only provided a very brief backstory. Overall she never feels like too much of a threat.There's one part in particular that I think is absolutely a candidate for worst sequence of 2023. Without spoiling it , it is essentially a planet that looks like a cheap rip off of the Wizard of Oz. It just captures all of the problems with this movie into one scene. There's been a lot of less than stellar work from Marvel since endgame, but this is reaching new depths.I'm not even going to get started on the cats scene with the theme song....Please Loki, reset the entire timeline."
"Marvels","Avwillfan89","23 December 2023",110,"This film is somehow way more depressing and worse than Ant Man Quantumania. We honestly thought Eternals was bad, but that was only the beginning. It was only going to go downhill from there.Watching this movie felt like watching a beloved friend in a coma fighting for her life. It was sad, frustrating and ultimately hopeless. So much potential squandered right before our very eyes.Much has been said about the Girl Power aspect of this story, but it doesn't mean jack when the characters are so thinly written. After the big character tension build up between Carol and Monica, with the latter resenting her for not coming back, their fractures mend themselves very quickly. There is no chemistry between the the two at all.The villain is Bland with a capitol B, and highly forgettable.Nick Fury is actually pathetic in this movie. He doesn't at all act like the Fury we know and love. He was more in character in Far From Home when Talos was impersonating him!I don't think I've ever had this much of a bad experience with a film since Cats. And it is telling that there actually features a ludicrous scene involving baby flerkens and the song Memory.What the actual hell, Marvel?The only good thing is that it is mercifully short, and Iman Vellani does seem to be enjoying herself in the role.Once a great studio, brought crumbling down on itself. If I could give it zero stars, I would."
"Marvels","chenp-54708","10 November 2023",210,"Marvel movies really have fallen apart haven't they? This is definitely one of the worst Marvels movie I have seen out of all the Marvel movies I had watched. There really isn't too much to say about the movie because ""The Marvels"" is pretty much like almost every single Marvel movie but the writing, humor, direction, and performances are pretty much all over the place. Director Nia DaCosta has made ""Little Woods"" which I liked but her direction here is pretty bad and goes all over the place.The special effects are kind of rough on the edges, the actions and thrills were just okay and the performances, despite a pretty good cast, they aren't very good. Brie Larson is an actress I like but unfortunately her performance felt weak and lacking. The other performances as well including the child performances. The story isn't interesting as the writing is pretty bland and none of the characters were interesting. With a short runtime, the movie surprisingly was really boring.I do like superhero movies but it seems this one really just sucked. Overall, it's bad."
"Marvels","kevin_robbins","12 November 2023",310,"My wife and I recently caught Marvel's (2023) in theaters. The plot revolves around Captain Marvel's mistake in choosing sides during a battle, disrupting the cosmic balance. Two young ladies gain powers in the process, and Captain Marvel must collaborate with them to rectify her error and restore equilibrium to the universe.Directed by Nia DaCosta (Candyman) and featuring Brie Larson (Lessons in Chemistry), Teyonah Parris (Dear White People), Iman Vellani (Ms. Marvel), Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction), and Zawe Ashton (Blitz).This film boasts clean and classic Marvel-style characters, cinematography, action scenes, and special effects. However, the plot seems somewhat lackluster, with Captain Marvel possibly appearing more as a villain than a hero. The backstories of the heroes lack sufficient development, making it challenging to form a connection with them. The cat steals the show initially but feels overdone by the end, and even Samuel L. Jackson's wit falls short of expectations.In summary, this superhero movie prioritizes its message over a compelling storyline. While the characters and visuals are in line with Marvel's trademark style, the plot may leave audiences indifferent. The lack of character depth and an engaging storyline earns this film a 3/10, making it a skip-worthy experience."

The finale was perfect, and a beautiful ending to the show, while The Marvels is a complete mess. It's honestly given me whiplashThe Marvels is just an all-around bad movie. The script is awful and the story is super rushed and poorly executed, which both have an impact on how well the characters (and in-turn the actors) come-across on-screenThe action and humour are kind of alright, and the VFX are definitely better than anything we've seen in an MCU project since Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness (with the obvious exceptions of Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 and Loki Season 2), but that still doesn't exactly make it look greatThis movie is just painful to watch at points! Early on, it has some really fun moments, and felt like it could have actually been somewhat entertaining, but that feeling vanished as soon as it came. It's barley better than Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania, so you can do with that information what you will."
"Marvels","NanoFrog","16 January 2024",110,"So Stan Lee passes away and we get Disney now in full control of Marvel stories...and boy is there a difference. I could not finish watching this really bad film, it is just junk from scene to scene. The cast, I feel so sorry for them because the cast is a fine group for the most part...but the story, the effects, the directing are all jumbled up into a real mess. The premise is interesting but they have no idea what to do with it. I have never been a fan of Disney, maybe when I was 10 years old, back in the early 60s, but this is not at all Walt Disney. This is Disney INC and a massive number of talentless paperwork and book-keepers make their films these days. This is just junk slammed together by people who have no idea how to tell a story or stage intelligent effects. This film is not a Turkey, it is, in fact, just garbage. RIP MArvel."
"Marvels","OnlyAtJMart","12 November 2023",410,"Anyone who heard the news about this project knows that the production was a nightmare, and it shows in the final product here. It's like they couldn't figure out what direction to go, so they made 4 versions, and blended them together. Which would explain the high budget, the 5 delays, and the reshoots. Kamala's character was probably the best part of the movie. I promise you, the script did her no favors, but she stood out. Her acting was in line with her character. This was probably an exciting opportunity for her, and she wasn't going to let a bad script, and production problems stop her from giving a great effort. However, the story, the dialogue, the musical gimmick, the weak villain. It just didn't work. I don't think the blame lies solely with the actors, or even the director, who did lack the experience for helming a movie with a budget this size. I think Disney interfered heavily with the production, which almost always yields bad results. I think it was doomed to fail. They put so much pressure on this being successful, they forgot to make it coherent, unique, or interesting."
"Marvels","mildlyintrusive","13 November 2023",210,"Once in a while I tend to go to my local theater to check out something new, maybe a new release or a re-run of a movie. Today, I stumbled upon The Marvels, I thought ""Hey, I haven't been going to the theater this month that often, maybe I should try this out?"" And well, it seems that I'd made the wrong decision. The Marvels follows the titular Marvels trying to stop an evil Kree with one disadvantage however, every time they use their powers, it's Freaky Friday.Maybe its because of the very troubled production but everything just feels like an amalgamation of three separate movies, its like a ADHD experience. The movie does NOT take itself seriously at all, and as a result, it makes me hard to care for literally everything! Its like a circus act masquerading as a movie, it doesn't work! There were moments where characters were in danger and they start joking about it every opportunity they get. To add insult to injury was the treatment of the character of Nick Fury, who feels like a completely different character altogether, cracking lame after lame jokes every single time! Special effects were decent, but considering the massive 271M+ budget I wished they could've at least cared about the plot and flesh out some if the characters and their motivations instead of relying on action scene after action scene, it gets tiring after a while you know?Brie Larson herself looks tired and forced in this movie, her character also being this girl-boss who can sweep through enemies in this movie, no weaknesses and no vulnerabilities. It all feels so one-dimensional, it tries to be like a 80s action star with the likes of Arnold and co. But fails because they lack charisma and charm. Because of this I found it impossible to relate to her in any sense of way. Monica Rambeau wasn't trying her best here, and there is no opposing dynamic between the two to the point where I found her virtually indistinguishable from Mrs. Danvers herself. However I do commend Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan, whose child-like personality I was comfortable with and is the standout between the three leads but suffers from being very underwritten and the villain is a copy-and-paste from dozens we've seen before.Overall, a messy and disjointed movie with not much to offer rather than annoying, dreadful humor and some few flashy action scenes. It certainly feels like homework for the MCU as it struggles to keep a hook in something after the Infinity Saga. Skip this one and play with your action figures instead, Im sure it'll be better than this."
"Marvels","critic-97-417657","4 February 2024",810,"The movie was somewhat ridiculous, but I found myself giggling throughout it. It was actually quite fun. There were a lot of really charming things about this movie, and while the storyline lacked any real tension, I didn't really care. It was mostly about the character development, and the relationships between the three main characters. Overall, I just found it really fun and just didn't take it very seriously. In a lot of ways, it is a set up for the rest of the series, and is definitely not a standalone movie. And the post credit scene, amazing. Ties in a lot of potential for what they are going to be doing in this franchise."
"Marvels","The-Sarkologist","7 February 2024",710,"Well, I guess someone was right when they said that one of the big problems with this film was that you had to like watch 8 other films and 3 series to sort of understand what was going on. Mind you, I have actually done just that, but even then with the amount of time that had passed since I watched the other things it was still a little tricky understanding what was happening.Mind you, I did actually quite like the film. Like the scenes where they were switching places whenever they used their powers together, and also the big bad in the film, that was in part trying to save her people, but also attempting to punish Captain Marvel for what she had done to her people. Yeah, as it turned out, when she destroyed the great intelligence it sent the Kree into a massive civil war which basically destroyed their planet.So, if you had seen Miss Marvel, you will know that she has a thing for Captain Marvel, and of course it was always going to be a thing that she was eventually going to be involved in a team up. Also, there were some hints at the end that suggested that there was going to be another team-up film, though apparently that will still be some way off (and the problem will be that, no doubt, when they get around to it, all of them will be too old to be members of a possible Young Avengers - kids do grow up a little too fast).Yeah, I thought that this film was pretty good, though I have to agree that the problem is that you do need to catch up to speed to understand what is going on. Oh, it also seemed that it felt that it was a bit over the place, no doubt because they wanted to make the film shorter than a lot of the others. Still, it's good, especially if you are up to date on the films."
"Marvels","cherold","30 January 2024",710,"After the bad reviews, and considering how many bad superhero movies have come out lately, I would have skipped this one if the trailer didn't look like so much fun. Fortunately, the movie fulfills the trailer's promiseIn the movie, three superheroes with related powers find themselves suddenly swapping places with one another. The proves to be a good gimmick for both action and comedy, as the three keep finding themselves in one another's battles. Eventually, they master the situation in order to take down a very angry villain with an unusually sympathetic backstory.The movie leans heavily - and for the most part successfully - into the comedy. A big chunk of this is fueled by the teenage Captain Marvel fangirl Ms. Marvel, who is from a TV series I found too pre-teen-oriented to enjoy. Ms. Marvel's an annoying character but for the most part I found her amusing in this.There's also a funny gag with alien cats.While I enjoyed this movie, I have to admit its a bit of an unfocussed mess. There are a lot of elements just tossed in, like a whole thing with Marvel #3, Monica, dealing with her abandonment issues. These occasional ""emotional"" moments don't much interest me.Anyway, a lot of people hate this, but if you like the trailer, I'd say chance the movie (I did not take a chance on the last Aquaman movie because unlike The Marvels, the trailer looked just as bad as people said the movie was.Going against the current, I say if you want a bunch of comedy and some fun action then you should watch this one."
"Marvels","drawlife","8 November 2023",510,"THE MARVELS is here and it's a mashed up film that is totally all over the place. It feels as if this film was edited and chopped into pieces during post and it shows.Couple things I enjoyed, I did like seeing Carol Danvers and Monica Rambeau resolve and acknowledge their relationship, but due to the nature of their characters being straight arrows, it allows Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan to be the audience just as Tom Holland's Peter Parker was in CIVIL WAR. I did not particularly enjoy the MS. MARVEL series, but I can see her being the shoutout for many.I think the script just touched on the surface of Brie Larson's Captain Marvel herself, so diving into her more is a plus, however the story did her no favors once again and I did feel like she was given like four or five pieces of direction to portray her character compared to the more one-note performance in the first film. Teyonah Parris is commendable. She was the more science-y of the trio.Samuel L. Jackson just feels inconsistent especially after SECRET INVASION. Feels like this Nick Fury is a variant. He's simply passing through in this film.Another thing I liked was the incursions (also briefly touched on in DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS). We all complained about the lack of planting seeds for the future leading into KANG DYNASTY and SECRET WARS. Finally, this film it at least preps and teases what's to come down the line.The MCU's villain problem is a long known fact, but here it only cements their problem even further. Now I'm a fan of Lee Pace's over the top performance as Ronan, but Dar-Benn played by Zawe Ashton is literally a copy and paste of Ronan, but female. Nothing new about it. Definitely up there as one of the worst villains in the MCU.The power swaps were kinda cool so I can give it that. Nia DaCosta does a good job executing the fight scenes, but again as one should expect, VFX is meh. Now if you cringed during the musical note duel between the two Doctor Strange, then wait till you see one segment of the film where it feels like a misplaced musical. Lots of quirky and annoying humor like one should expect in an MCU film.The Skrulls are in the film and as a fan we always think we can write the better film after watching it, but I just DO NOT understand why this sequel couldn't have been SECRET INVASION(one of the worst MCU Disney+ shows). SECRET INVASION honestly should have been an Avengers film or at the very least a Captain Marvel sequel co-starring some Avengers, kinda like CIVIL WAR. I personally feel like that dilemma could have furthered Captain Marvel's development due to her involvement with them and how she's equally to blame for not helping them out when she and Fury promised to find them a home. But instead she's stuck with this material.The mid-credit scene is arguably the best part. Once again teasing things to come. It's stuff that like that, that will maybe still garner interest in the MCU despite its current fall from grace. The end-credit scene is alright. Not particularly jazzed about that promise down the line.On that note, the recent Variety article published about Marvel Studios talked about their behind the scenes trouble. It was said that Kevin Feige and his creative committee partook in their yearly Palm Springs retreat to regroup and refocus, so here's hoping to next year being more consistent with quality. Seemed like he was spread too thin with the mandate to have more quantity than quality.THE MARVELS is a season 1.5 for MS. MARVEL and a CAPTAIN MARVEL sequel that we never saw due to the flashbacks and exposition to explain things. And let's be clear, at this point everything feels like homework. That was going to be inevitable moving forward after INFINITY WAR and ENDGAMGE, but especially when Disney+ was announced making Kevin Feige spread out too thin. But it only feels like homework because everything that has been released is below the standard of what Marvel set up for us.So to sum it up, while I did find it slightly more appealing than the first CAPTAIN MARVEL and QUANTUMANIA, that isn't saying much. Low expectations definitely helped. Is THE MARVELS one of the worst? No, but it definitely belongs way down below the list.5/10."
"Marvels","tibby_23","17 January 2024",410,"By far the worst Marvel movie so far, I am extremely disappointed. After the mess that Thor 4 was, I was hoping that Marvel learned its lesson, but it seems not. I am honestly happy this movie did bad at the box office, that's what you get for ruining such a great character (I loved Cpt. Marvel from the comics).What makes it bad:
Action moves way too fast from one scene to anotherNo character improvement or growth by the end of the movieThings just happen with no storytellingNot serious enough, too childish for my tasteToo many goofy moments (singing, really? We've come this low, Marvel?)End scenes that try to set the context for next movies seem forced and unnecessaryI also found two good things eventually:
I liked the villain and her story, sympathized with her a bitAt least the movie was not long.These writers should never be hired again."
"Marvels","olcare","10 November 2023",410,"Criticizing specific parts of the movie became confusing for me as there were so many details I wanted to change. This film truly disappointed me, especially since my expectations were already low, and falling below them is a bad sign for Marvel. It had a Thor: Love and Thunder vibe, which I also disliked (4/10). I had been excited after watching Loki in the morning, but it was in vain.For me, the unbearable part was the music. After checking the playlists of movies I've watched for a long time, Marvel had by far the worst compositions. The music was exaggerated, drowning out the impact of fight scenes and making them unbearable. It was like overly noisy background music during a break.Another aspect I didn't like was the main villain. I can't believe Marvel fell into the same mistake again. The villain was poorly written, and Zawe Ashton's performance felt forced, appearing awkward in scenes. One major reason for this was the poor portrayal of the Kree Empire in the MCU. Neglecting the significance of the Kree made Supreme look bad. They could have explained the critical situation of the 'Hala' planet in the film's opening with a 30-35 minute sequence, providing context for the desperation of the Kree.Another thing I found absurd was Monica teleporting to a parallel universe. They portrayed the concept of parallel universes like child's play. Especially after watching Loki Season 2 in the morning, her randomly teleporting or getting stuck in another universe seemed too simplistic.Seeing Professor Beast was surprising and pleasing. The X-Men era is beginning, and despite the poor productions, I'm excited. Brie Larson was good again, carrying her character well. The scene with Monica, Kamala, Danvers vs Dar-Benn was good, thankfully without music. However, despite not being a fan of Kamala Khan, her origin is preserved, and it's not bad. But I feel there's a lack of harmony among our main three characters, and I believe it's a script issue, not an actor one.While I like the idea of saving a planet by traveling through different planets, I didn't like the execution at all. Presenting such a serious and contemporary issue as if it's the simplest thing with childlike music seems somewhat unserious to me.However it turns out, this film paved the way for others and served as a stepping stone. Hopefully, with Beast in Deadpool 3, the overall MCU storyline will improve, abandoning mediocrity urgently; otherwise, it will continue to receive poor ratings.Note: I forgot to mention in the review, but Goose is a fantastic character, and I hope we continue to see this adorable cat. The scene with all the cats was genuinely entertaining, one of the enjoyable moments in 4-5 scenes."
"Marvels","alensufli","8 November 2023",210,"Even writing a review is extremely pointless as we all knew what we were expecting months before but here I am. They even themselves admitted it. The film is a huge disappointment. The plot is all over the place. Actions sequences were sometimes good but sometime were so dumb I didn't know where to look, where to pay attention. I like how they tried to catch the old marvel magic. Yes. They tried. But they utterly failed. Feige pulled off ""wait until the post credit scene to get excited cuz the film itself is boring"" trick again. And it wasn't a ""wow"" for me at least. The theatre was silent throughout and after the film. No one even made a giggling sound. Dead silence. Jokes were landing facedown to the ground every time a character made one. That's right. Every character there is comic relief. And I absolutely don't wanna talk about acting."
"Marvels","S3pt3m63r","18 November 2023",NA,"Unfortunately if you haven't got Disney plus and you don't keep to speed with the tv series, then you this movie won't make much sense as it relies on you knowing what's going on in that universe so far, which I'm not up to date with and involves the Miss Marvels characters which haven't been introduced in the movies. Confusing.I had hoped that following Guardians 3 it could've get much worse for the Marvel universe, at least Guardians has Rocket😂It's hard to find any plot to this movie. Carol Danvers (Captain Marvel) does throw a lot of people through the roof but the plot is a quantum entanglement mess. The movie is blissfully short but feels longer as it's so bad and some people walked out of the theatre. I was so pleasantly when it ended.I think it's about to retire the whole Marvel superhero franchise as this phase is going badly."
"Marvels","nscoby93","10 November 2023",210,"I actually had no intention of watching this film in theaters. Originally, I was just going to wait for its home release on Disney Plus, but after recently rewatching WandaVision, I genuinely wanted to see how they would handle Monica Rambeau and see what they would do with her.So I'll mention the positives for this film first...The movie is actually pretty, I really enjoyed the film aesthetically it looked good. This is very surprising to say as recent Marvel projects are tremendous eye sores.The films central characters, Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) and Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani), were surprisingly good. I had fully anticipated to dislike Captain Marvel and Ms Marvel in this film but I surprisingly enjoyed them both which is a big compliment coming from me, and Monica Rambeau is my favorite of the three she was good as I expected and anticipated. All three actresses gave enjoyable performances, and they all worked well together on screen.Then, of course, Samuel Jackson is always great! And the return of everyone's favorite Flerken kitty Goose. She had a great sequence that I refuse to spoil, but it had me dying. Goose saved this film!And well that's it...This film is just bad. Bad writing, bad pacing, bad storytelling. Nothing in this film is properly set up as it rushes through its 1 hour and 45 minute run time. Which is quite frankly fine for me as I genuinely did not want more of this.This movie as a whole is just overwhelmingly safe. It has no stakes, takes no risks, and does nothing. But there is actual enjoyment in its failings. It was so bad that it was good. The amount of eye rolling, face palms, and sighs I gave through this film was astonishing. I gave up on this film within the first 30 minutes, and afterward, that's when the enjoyment began because of how bad it went on to be.Then suddenly, out of nowhere, the film became a musical? Like what is happening? This film is so chaotic and unstructured. It just never stopped.The film had a good mid-credit scene so you know stay for that. Unfortunately, it was spoiled for me, so it didn't hit as hard as it could have. Especially if you're a fan of the actor who originally played the character the scene introduces.But The Marvels was exactly what I anticipated it to be, a below average dump. Which is a shame because they play with some interesting concepts in this film, but they do nothing with them, or they are just poorly handled. I can at least say I didn't hate this movie. Unfortunately, I just enjoyed it for all the wrong reasons.IMDb: 3/10

"Marvels","brentsbulletinboard","11 November 2023",510,"When I first heard the title of this movie, I thought it was about a 1960s girls' singing group. And, frankly, that would have probably made for a better movie. Writer-director Nia DaCosta's third feature outing and the latest in the Marvel Universe paradigm is a wildly inconsistent superhero movie that tries too hard to do too much and doesn't have a script to support it. Too many of its plot elements aren't adequately explained until well into the story, while others aren't explained at all, leaving viewers who aren't comic book laureates wondering what's going on (particularly at film's end). Meanwhile, other narrative aspects frequently appear gimmicky and grow old quickly, such as the introduction of the primary superpower that its three protagonists share, one that almost becomes slapstickish after an all-too-brief while. On top of that, the CGI effects vacillate from one end of the quality spectrum to the other, creating a mix of images that are either startling to look at or stunningly cheesy at best. Add to that a villain that isn't particularly menacing, along with attempts at humor that either succeed brilliantly (cat lovers take note) or fall flat and look incredibly lame (as aficionados of musical theater will undoubtedly attest), all of which further add to the picture's pervasive inconsistency. The inclusion of ample clues for advancing the overarching Marvel Universe storyline continues here, too, furthering a trend that's growing tiresome in the studio's releases, a development akin to the ""Paul is dead"" legacy come to life with every passing picture. Then there's the trio of heroes themselves, who often appear more like they've been plucked from a giddy slumber party flick or a Cyndi Lauper video than taking center stage as seriously empowered champions in an action-adventure offering. All of these failings combine to make this production more of a forgettable placeholder in the Marvel mythology than a standalone feature (not to mention a pale substitute for a sequel to the far-superior film that launched the Captain Marvel franchise in 2019). In short, ""The Marvels"" is as much of a mess as it is a movie, and that's troubling for several reasons. It lends credence to the growing criticism that films like this aren't to be taken seriously. It reinforces the notion that they're cookie-cutter in nature, easily interchangeable with one another. And it raises questions about the career choices of lead actress Brie Larson, who, though quite capable of playing roles like these, is running the risk of becoming type-cast, a troubling prospect for an Academy Award-winning actress who possesses a depth of talent and is handily adept at taking on better and more serious material than this. In the wake of this release, Marvel Studios should take a step back and seriously assess where its future is headed, especially if movies like this are any indication. As pictures like ""Wakanda Forever"" (2022) show, the studio is capable of better work - and it's time to show viewers that."
"Marvels","Sleepin_Dragon","10 November 2023",410,"Carol Danvers is attempting to save the universe, but her incredible powers become entangled with those of Kamala Khan and Monica Rambeau, they must unite to save the world.Ouch, what can you say, this is surely one of Marvel's lowest points, I honestly don't know who the target audience is, or who this is going to appeal to, young teens only maybe? Anyhow, this was an absolute mess.The writing was clearly problematic, it doesn't gel, it is genuinely all over the place. I do very much wonder if huge sections of this film cut? It can be the only answer, it just doesn't flow at all, and that short run time...Special effects, some were pretty good, some were poor, I just wish there was a greater focus on plot, it just seemed like 100 minutes of CGI, noise and random events.Brie Larson, I'm not sure about you, but to me she looked totally disinterested and bored by the whole thing, what I didn't see, was someone committed to the role. I thought Samuel Jackson was rather good, but again poorly served by the script.It didn't look great from the trailers, and in reality, it's another clunker from Marvel Studios.4/10."
"Marvels","judywalker2","14 December 2023",510,"Went to see this movie with my 17- and 11-year-old granddaughters. One is a Ms. Marvel fan and the other is now. For me I was hoping for something that children and adults could enjoy. But, no only kids will enjoy this silly mess.I enjoyed the Captain Marvel movie and thought the criticism was not warranted. I also loved Wanda Vision and the introduction of Monica Rambeau and I was hoping for at least a good continuation of her story. I didn't watch Ms. Marvel because I'm not a teen and I knew it wasn't for me; and after watching her parts in this movie I'm glad I stuck to that.All three actresses are good and of course Samuel L in always a pleasure to see, but none of the other characters including the so-called villain were the least bit interesting. Most of the scenes were just downright silly. I hope they continue Monica's story with better writing and I wish Marvel would stop being silly and go back to making movies for adults and kids."
"Marvels","isaacsundaralingam","11 November 2023",310,"The MCU has absolutely overstayed its welcome. Post Avengers Endgame, these projects have been feeling more and more like content than cinema (except the rare surprises like GOTG 3). Superhero fatigue, they call it and this movie does practically nothing but to amp it up to 11.You watch the trailer, you know what happens. You bet on originality, you end up homeless. There's nothing new for me to say that I haven't already said about any of the other MCU content as of late. It's so generic that I'm confident a year from now, no one would remember this movie even existed. With every new MCU project, the jokes-per-minute ratio keeps getting worse, the villains are a writer's version of a stock photograph (I can't even remember the villain's name in this movie and it hasn't even been a day since I watched it), the CGI is so out there you can almost see the CGI artists' tears on screen, and it's getting more and more difficult to tell each MCU project apart cos they're all just the same.The only few positives I can identify here are actresses Iman Vellani and Brie Larson (Larson, who seems much more relaxed and settled into her superhero boots), and maybe the flashy action sequences. Otherwise, there's nothing here to watch, nothing here to experience and nothing here to enjoy. What a shame."
"Marvels","MrDHWong","9 November 2023",410,"""The Marvels"" is the sequel to 2019's ""Captain Marvel"", a continuation of the Disney+ series ""Ms. Marvel"", and the 33rd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris, and Iman Vellani, it represents a painful look at the downward spiral the MCU has found itself caught in since the end of Phase 3.Sometime after the events of ""Captain Marvel"", Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) has unintentionally started a civil war among the alien race known as the Kree. The leader of the Kree, Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton), soon finds one half of the Quantum Bands and later seeks out the other half, which is in the possession of Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel (Iman Vellani). At the request of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Carol teams up with Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) to negotiate peace among the Kree, but as the two investigate a wormhole in outer space, Monica, Carol, and Kamala start mysteriously switching powers with one another. Realising something is amiss, the trio are forced to work together to figure out what is causing this strange phenomena and hopefully put a stop to both Dar-Benn and the warring Kree.It's becoming harder and harder to call myself fan of the MCU, given the array of serviceable to terrible projects they have been churning out lately. To be fair though, it is a tall order to top something as ambitious as the culmination of over ten years worth of universe building after both ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and ""Avengers: Endgame"" pulled it off so effectively years ago. For the longest time, I have been willing to defend the post-Endgame MCU for trying different things, as I was under the impression that all of this would be leading to exciting new projects on the horizon. However, after sitting through ""The Marvels"", I can say with a hint of heartbreak that practically all of my optimism for the MCU's future has all but disappeared, as it contains next to nothing worth defending from a creative standpoint.Perhaps the best way to describe my viewing experience with this film would be ""apathetic"", because at no point does it ever feel like anything important is at stake. This is mainly due to either our three heroes being too overpowered or there not being enough information provided about the ones who need saving. Whenever a horde of enemies are swarming the trio, we watch as the three of them effortlessly take them out without even breaking a sweat. Action-packed moments like these that once elicited excitement have now been reduced to a series of bland fistfights and generic CGI blasts that have all been done before in better MCU films.We see Carol Danvers quickly blast everyone away with her energy beams and block punches with her hands, never once showing any signs that she is in real danger. Her accomplice Monica Rambeau does pretty much the same thing, only with less time on screen. Even Kamala Khan, who is the biggest fish-out-of-water in this situation, has no major trouble dealing with foes coming at her from every angle, always using her half of the Quantum Band to her advantage. How is it possible to keep the audience on their toes if the enemy forces are so inefficient that even an inexperienced child can wipe the floor with them this easily? On that note, it also doesn't help that none of these three heroes appear to have any physical weaknesses or personal insecurities holding them back, which causes all of the tension to evaporate instantly.In addition to this, we are barely shown anything interesting about the Kree that will keep the audience invested in their role in the story. As far as the film is concerned, they are nothing more than a stock species of extraterrestrials that are causing problems simply because the plot demands it. The original ""Captain Marvel"" film established that the Kree were the ones who inadvertently gave Carol her powers and took her in among them. Yet, this film never reminds the audience of that, instead opting to throw them right into the thick of the conflict without any important context. As a result, I just did not care at all about what happened to any of these people.It's also worth mentioning that this film is rife with obvious re-edits and tonal inconsistencies. One scene where this is most evident is where Carol Danvers is opening up to both Rambeau and Khan about her relationship with the Kree. What could have been a good method of showcasing Danvers's humanity is instead brushed aside for something completely unrelated after less than two minutes. I couldn't help but assume that this scene was supposed to go on much longer but was cut in post production for whatever reason. To add insult to injury, the scene is then immediately followed by a strange attempt at comic relief which fails to raise even a single laugh. Although Marvel films are known for their blending of comedy with drama, a moment like this felt like a rather tacky addition to the film that only hampers the already poor narrative structure. Worse still, there are other similar occurrences like this throughout the rest of the story.One of the biggest problems with the original ""Captain Marvel"" film was how weakly written the title character was, with her lack of likeable character traits and overly serious demeanour being a major reason why she is not viewed favourably by fans. You'd expect the filmmakers to remedy this problem for the sequel, but you would be wrong. I'm not sure whether it's Brie Larson's underwhelming performance or just plain old bad writing but I have never once felt any fondness for Carol Danvers as a person. As mentioned above, she efficiently fights her way through many bad guys with no issue whatsoever, never once showing any emotional weakness or other potential vulnerabilities. Because of this, Carol Danvers never feels like a real person, being nothing more than a one-dimensional superhero that is practically impossible for anybody to identify with. Her character has not changed or grown since the first film, and it looks like she won't be doing so anytime soon.I keep trying to remind myself of Monica Rambeau's contribution to the story but nothing memorable ever comes to mind without doing some kind of online research. Like Brie Larson, there is nothing especially remarkable about Teyonah Parris's performance, as her character is as bland as she comes. Though it is established that Rambeau looked up to Carol Danvers as a child, her role in this story is nothing more than playing second fiddle to an already dull lead protagonist. Yes, Rambeau is very strong and yes, she is more than capable of taking care of herself in a fight, but beyond that what else does she offer? Most of the time she just goes along with Danvers's orders without ever questioning her or giving her personal opinions, making her nothing more than a blind follower. I was hoping to have seen some kind of opposing dynamic between Danvers and Rambeau, as that would have given their characters an important amount of depth the distinguish the two from one another. No such luck I'm afraid.The only character I sort of cared about was Kamala Khan, whose childlike naiveté made her the most relatable of the three leads. In her feature film debut, Iman Vellani does carry over many of Khan's human traits from the Disney+ series ""Ms. Marvel"", being that she's still young and coming to terms with mastering her powers. Unfortunately, she does not achieve this through the character herself, but rather due to how woefully underwritten her two co-stars are in comparison. I wanted to see the three as kindred spirits, fighting as trio but standing out as individuals. Instead, all we get are two dull, stoic, overpowered adults and a young kid working together for no other reason than because the writers said so.As depressing as it sounds, the once mighty MCU is showing no signs of improvement as ""The Marvels"" just may be the worst film in the series so far. There simply isn't enough reason to justify its existence outside of some kind of contractual obligation by the higher ups at Disney, and I fully respect many people's decision to skip it altogether. At this point, I seriously doubt the MCU can ever return to its former glory, as this film is set to become the series' biggest box office bomb to date. I can only hope in vain that Disney will learn an important lesson from this film's failure, but knowing their track record that seems unlikely.I rate it 4/10."
"Marvels","danieljfarthing","9 January 2024",110,"2019's ""Captain Marvel"" wasn't too bad, for a superhero movie, but its sequel ""The Marvels"" is an unmitigated stinking disaster - the WORST Marvel movie to date (which is saying something). Set a decade or two after the original, Brie Larson (via Samuel L Jackson) teams somewhat inadvertently with Teyonah Parris & Iman Vellani (awful) to save Gary Lewis' people (what happened to previous leader Ben Mendelsohn?!) from evil Zawe Ashton. Director Nia DaCosta (who also co-wrote this tripe with Megan McDonnell & Elissa Karasik) creates a headache inducing, fast (as if bizarrely sped up), frantic, thoroughly annoying, tiresome piece of garbage.

"Marvels","ThereelscoopwithKK","10 November 2023",110,"This second installment makes the original Captain Marvel look like a cinematic masterpiece... Nothing about this movie works. Although Brie Larson's acting has improved over the years it feels like she doesn't want to be there for this at all. Further, when you break it down, there is really no story at all happening. In fact, the solution to the entire problem is so extremely simple and solvable that you really wonder why there was a conflict in the first place. So much of everything is unexplained and eventually you stop trying to figure it out because you eventually lose all interest . Samuel L Jackson's character , Nick Fury, is hardly even a shell of his former self and is essentially now demoted to comedic relief.The scenes don't really mesh together at all. None of them are really necessary to advancing a plot and all feature the same repeated choreographic battle. The villain lacks any real charisma and is only provided a very brief backstory. Overall she never feels like too much of a threat.There's one part in particular that I think is absolutely a candidate for worst sequence of 2023. Without spoiling it , it is essentially a planet that looks like a cheap rip off of the Wizard of Oz. It just captures all of the problems with this movie into one scene. There's been a lot of less than stellar work from Marvel since endgame, but this is reaching new depths.I'm not even going to get started on the cats scene with the theme song....Please Loki, reset the entire timeline."

So much potential squandered right before our very eyes.Much has been said about the Girl Power aspect of this story, but it doesn't mean jack when the characters are so thinly written. After the big character tension build up between Carol and Monica, with the latter resenting her for not coming back, their fractures mend themselves very quickly. There is no chemistry between the the two at all.The villain is Bland with a capitol B, and highly forgettable.Nick Fury is actually pathetic in this movie. He doesn't at all act like the Fury we know and love. He was more in character in Far From Home when Talos was impersonating him!I don't think I've ever had this much of a bad experience with a film since Cats. And it is telling that there actually features a ludicrous scene involving baby flerkens and the song Memory.What the actual hell, Marvel?The only good thing is that it is mercifully short, and Iman Vellani does seem to be enjoying herself in the role.Once a great studio, brought crumbling down on itself.

Director Nia DaCosta has made ""Little Woods"" which I liked but her direction here is pretty bad and goes all over the place.The special effects are kind of rough on the edges, the actions and thrills were just okay and the performances, despite a pretty good cast, they aren't very good. Brie Larson is an actress I like but unfortunately her performance felt weak and lacking. The other performances as well including the child performances. The story isn't interesting as the writing is pretty bland and none of the characters were interesting. With a short runtime, the movie surprisingly was really boring.I do like superhero movies but it seems this one really just sucked. Overall, it's bad."
"Marvels","kevin_robbins","12 November 2023",310,"My wife and I recently caught Marvel's (2023) in theaters. The plot revolves around Captain Marvel's mistake in choosing sides during a battle, disrupting the cosmic balance. Two young ladies gain powers in the process, and Captain Marvel must collaborate with them to rectify her error and restore equilibrium to the universe.Directed by Nia DaCosta (Candyman) and featuring Brie Larson (Lessons in Chemistry), Teyonah Parris (Dear White People), Iman Vellani (Ms. Marvel), Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction), and Zawe Ashton (Blitz).This film boasts clean and classic Marvel-style characters, cinematography, action scenes, and special effects. However, the plot seems somewhat lackluster, with Captain Marvel possibly appearing more as a villain than a hero. The backstories of the heroes lack sufficient development, making it challenging to form a connection with them. The cat steals the show initially but feels overdone by the end, and even Samuel L. Jackson's wit falls short of expectations.In summary, this superhero movie prioritizes its message over a compelling storyline. While the characters and visuals are in line with Marvel's trademark style, the plot may leave audiences indifferent. The lack of character depth and an engaging storyline earns this film a 3/10, making it a skip-worthy experience."
"Marvels","SHU_Movies","10 November 2023",310,"Going from the Loki Series Finale this morning to The Marvels this evening was (for lack of a better word) bonkers! The finale was perfect, and a beautiful ending to the show, while The Marvels is a complete mess. It's honestly given me whiplashThe Marvels is just an all-around bad movie. The script is awful and the story is super rushed and poorly executed, which both have an impact on how well the characters (and in-turn the actors) come-across on-screenThe action and humour are kind of alright, and the VFX are definitely better than anything we've seen in an MCU project since Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness (with the obvious exceptions of Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 and Loki Season 2), but that still doesn't exactly make it look greatThis movie is just painful to watch at points! Early on, it has some really fun moments, and felt like it could have actually been somewhat entertaining, but that feeling vanished as soon as it came. It's barley better than Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania, so you can do with that information what you will."
"Marvels","NanoFrog","16 January 2024",110,"So Stan Lee passes away and we get Disney now in full control of Marvel stories...and boy is there a difference. I could not finish watching this really bad film, it is just junk from scene to scene. The cast, I feel so sorry for them because the cast is a fine group for the most part...but the story, the effects, the directing are all jumbled up into a real mess. The premise is interesting but they have no idea what to do with it. I have never been a fan of Disney, maybe when I was 10 years old, back in the early 60s, but this is not at all Walt Disney. This is Disney INC and a massive number of talentless paperwork and book-keepers make their films these days. This is just junk slammed together by people who have no idea how to tell a story or stage intelligent effects. This film is not a Turkey, it is, in fact, just garbage. RIP MArvel."
"Marvels","OnlyAtJMart","12 November 2023",410,"Anyone who heard the news about this project knows that the production was a nightmare, and it shows in the final product here. It's like they couldn't figure out what direction to go, so they made 4 versions, and blended them together. Which would explain the high budget, the 5 delays, and the reshoots. Kamala's character was probably the best part of the movie. I promise you, the script did her no favors, but she stood out. Her acting was in line with her character. This was probably an exciting opportunity for her, and she wasn't going to let a bad script, and production problems stop her from giving a great effort. However, the story, the dialogue, the musical gimmick, the weak villain. It just didn't work. I don't think the blame lies solely with the actors, or even the director, who did lack the experience for helming a movie with a budget this size. I think Disney interfered heavily with the production, which almost always yields bad results. I think it was doomed to fail. They put so much pressure on this being successful, they forgot to make it coherent, unique, or interesting."
"Marvels","mildlyintrusive","13 November 2023",210,"Once in a while I tend to go to my local theater to check out something new, maybe a new release or a re-run of a movie. Today, I stumbled upon The Marvels, I thought ""Hey, I haven't been going to the theater this month that often, maybe I should try this out?"" And well, it seems that I'd made the wrong decision. The Marvels follows the titular Marvels trying to stop an evil Kree with one disadvantage however, every time they use their powers, it's Freaky Friday.Maybe its because of the very troubled production but everything just feels like an amalgamation of three separate movies, its like a ADHD experience. The movie does NOT take itself seriously at all, and as a result, it makes me hard to care for literally everything! Its like a circus act masquerading as a movie, it doesn't work! There were moments where characters were in danger and they start joking about it every opportunity they get. To add insult to injury was the treatment of the character of Nick Fury, who feels like a completely different character altogether, cracking lame after lame jokes every single time! Special effects were decent, but considering the massive 271M+ budget I wished they could've at least cared about the plot and flesh out some if the characters and their motivations instead of relying on action scene after action scene, it gets tiring after a while you know?Brie Larson herself looks tired and forced in this movie, her character also being this girl-boss who can sweep through enemies in this movie, no weaknesses and no vulnerabilities. It all feels so one-dimensional, it tries to be like a 80s action star with the likes of Arnold and co. But fails because they lack charisma and charm. Because of this I found it impossible to relate to her in any sense of way. Monica Rambeau wasn't trying her best here, and there is no opposing dynamic between the two to the point where I found her virtually indistinguishable from Mrs. Danvers herself. However I do commend Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan, whose child-like personality I was comfortable with and is the standout between the three leads but suffers from being very underwritten and the villain is a copy-and-paste from dozens we've seen before.Overall, a messy and disjointed movie with not much to offer rather than annoying, dreadful humor and some few flashy action scenes. It certainly feels like homework for the MCU as it struggles to keep a hook in something after the Infinity Saga. Skip this one and play with your action figures instead, Im sure it'll be better than this."
"Marvels","critic-97-417657","4 February 2024",810,"The movie was somewhat ridiculous, but I found myself giggling throughout it. It was actually quite fun. There were a lot of really charming things about this movie, and while the storyline lacked any real tension, I didn't really care. It was mostly about the character development, and the relationships between the three main characters. Overall, I just found it really fun and just didn't take it very seriously. In a lot of ways, it is a set up for the rest of the series, and is definitely not a standalone movie. And the post credit scene, amazing. Ties in a lot of potential for what they are going to be doing in this franchise."
"Marvels","The-Sarkologist","7 February 2024",710,"Well, I guess someone was right when they said that one of the big problems with this film was that you had to like watch 8 other films and 3 series to sort of understand what was going on. Mind you, I have actually done just that, but even then with the amount of time that had passed since I watched the other things it was still a little tricky understanding what was happening.Mind you, I did actually quite like the film. Like the scenes where they were switching places whenever they used their powers together, and also the big bad in the film, that was in part trying to save her people, but also attempting to punish Captain Marvel for what she had done to her people. Yeah, as it turned out, when she destroyed the great intelligence it sent the Kree into a massive civil war which basically destroyed their planet.So, if you had seen Miss Marvel, you will know that she has a thing for Captain Marvel, and of course it was always going to be a thing that she was eventually going to be involved in a team up. Also, there were some hints at the end that suggested that there was going to be another team-up film, though apparently that will still be some way off (and the problem will be that, no doubt, when they get around to it, all of them will be too old to be members of a possible Young Avengers - kids do grow up a little too fast).Yeah, I thought that this film was pretty good, though I have to agree that the problem is that you do need to catch up to speed to understand what is going on. Oh, it also seemed that it felt that it was a bit over the place, no doubt because they wanted to make the film shorter than a lot of the others. Still, it's good, especially if you are up to date on the films."
"Marvels","cherold","30 January 2024",710,"After the bad reviews, and considering how many bad superhero movies have come out lately, I would have skipped this one if the trailer didn't look like so much fun. Fortunately, the movie fulfills the trailer's promiseIn the movie, three superheroes with related powers find themselves suddenly swapping places with one another. The proves to be a good gimmick for both action and comedy, as the three keep finding themselves in one another's battles. Eventually, they master the situation in order to take down a very angry villain with an unusually sympathetic backstory.The movie leans heavily - and for the most part successfully - into the comedy. A big chunk of this is fueled by the teenage Captain Marvel fangirl Ms. Marvel, who is from a TV series I found too pre-teen-oriented to enjoy. Ms. Marvel's an annoying character but for the most part I found her amusing in this.There's also a funny gag with alien cats.While I enjoyed this movie, I have to admit its a bit of an unfocussed mess. There are a lot of elements just tossed in, like a whole thing with Marvel #3, Monica, dealing with her abandonment issues. These occasional ""emotional"" moments don't much interest me.Anyway, a lot of people hate this, but if you like the trailer, I'd say chance the movie (I did not take a chance on the last Aquaman movie because unlike The Marvels, the trailer looked just as bad as people said the movie was.Going against the current, I say if you want a bunch of comedy and some fun action then you should watch this one."
"Marvels","drawlife","8 November 2023",510,"THE MARVELS is here and it's a mashed up film that is totally all over the place. It feels as if this film was edited and chopped into pieces during post and it shows.Couple things I enjoyed, I did like seeing Carol Danvers and Monica Rambeau resolve and acknowledge their relationship, but due to the nature of their characters being straight arrows, it allows Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan to be the audience just as Tom Holland's Peter Parker was in CIVIL WAR. I did not particularly enjoy the MS. MARVEL series, but I can see her being the shoutout for many.I think the script just touched on the surface of Brie Larson's Captain Marvel herself, so diving into her more is a plus, however the story did her no favors once again and I did feel like she was given like four or five pieces of direction to portray her character compared to the more one-note performance in the first film. Teyonah Parris is commendable. She was the more science-y of the trio.Samuel L. Jackson just feels inconsistent especially after SECRET INVASION. Feels like this Nick Fury is a variant. He's simply passing through in this film.Another thing I liked was the incursions (also briefly touched on in DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS). We all complained about the lack of planting seeds for the future leading into KANG DYNASTY and SECRET WARS. Finally, this film it at least preps and teases what's to come down the line.The MCU's villain problem is a long known fact, but here it only cements their problem even further. Now I'm a fan of Lee Pace's over the top performance as Ronan, but Dar-Benn played by Zawe Ashton is literally a copy and paste of Ronan, but female. Nothing new about it. Definitely up there as one of the worst villains in the MCU.The power swaps were kinda cool so I can give it that. Nia DaCosta does a good job executing the fight scenes, but again as one should expect, VFX is meh. Now if you cringed during the musical note duel between the two Doctor Strange, then wait till you see one segment of the film where it feels like a misplaced musical. Lots of quirky and annoying humor like one should expect in an MCU film.The Skrulls are in the film and as a fan we always think we can write the better film after watching it, but I just DO NOT understand why this sequel couldn't have been SECRET INVASION(one of the worst MCU Disney+ shows). SECRET INVASION honestly should have been an Avengers film or at the very least a Captain Marvel sequel co-starring some Avengers, kinda like CIVIL WAR. I personally feel like that dilemma could have furthered Captain Marvel's development due to her involvement with them and how she's equally to blame for not helping them out when she and Fury promised to find them a home. But instead she's stuck with this material.The mid-credit scene is arguably the best part. Once again teasing things to come. It's stuff that like that, that will maybe still garner interest in the MCU despite its current fall from grace. The end-credit scene is alright. Not particularly jazzed about that promise down the line.On that note, the recent Variety article published about Marvel Studios talked about their behind the scenes trouble. It was said that Kevin Feige and his creative committee partook in their yearly Palm Springs retreat to regroup and refocus, so here's hoping to next year being more consistent with quality. Seemed like he was spread too thin with the mandate to have more quantity than quality.THE MARVELS is a season 1.5 for MS. MARVEL and a CAPTAIN MARVEL sequel that we never saw due to the flashbacks and exposition to explain things. And let's be clear, at this point everything feels like homework. That was going to be inevitable moving forward after INFINITY WAR and ENDGAMGE, but especially when Disney+ was announced making Kevin Feige spread out too thin. But it only feels like homework because everything that has been released is below the standard of what Marvel set up for us.So to sum it up, while I did find it slightly more appealing than the first CAPTAIN MARVEL and QUANTUMANIA, that isn't saying much. Low expectations definitely helped. Is THE MARVELS one of the worst? No, but it definitely belongs way down below the list.5/10."
"Marvels","tibby_23","17 January 2024",410,"By far the worst Marvel movie so far, I am extremely disappointed. After the mess that Thor 4 was, I was hoping that Marvel learned its lesson, but it seems not. I am honestly happy this movie did bad at the box office, that's what you get for ruining such a great character (I loved Cpt. Marvel from the comics).What makes it bad:
Action moves way too fast from one scene to anotherNo character improvement or growth by the end of the movieThings just happen with no storytellingNot serious enough, too childish for my tasteToo many goofy moments (singing, really? We've come this low, Marvel?)End scenes that try to set the context for next movies seem forced and unnecessaryI also found two good things eventually:
I liked the villain and her story, sympathized with her a bitAt least the movie was not long.These writers should never be hired again."
"Marvels","olcare","10 November 2023",410,"Criticizing specific parts of the movie became confusing for me as there were so many details I wanted to change. This film truly disappointed me, especially since my expectations were already low, and falling below them is a bad sign for Marvel. It had a Thor: Love and Thunder vibe, which I also disliked (4/10). I had been excited after watching Loki in the morning, but it was in vain.For me, the unbearable part was the music. After checking the playlists of movies I've watched for a long time, Marvel had by far the worst compositions. The music was exaggerated, drowning out the impact of fight scenes and making them unbearable. It was like overly noisy background music during a break.Another aspect I didn't like was the main villain. I can't believe Marvel fell into the same mistake again. The villain was poorly written, and Zawe Ashton's performance felt forced, appearing awkward in scenes. One major reason for this was the poor portrayal of the Kree Empire in the MCU. Neglecting the significance of the Kree made Supreme look bad. They could have explained the critical situation of the 'Hala' planet in the film's opening with a 30-35 minute sequence, providing context for the desperation of the Kree.Another thing I found absurd was Monica teleporting to a parallel universe. They portrayed the concept of parallel universes like child's play. Especially after watching Loki Season 2 in the morning, her randomly teleporting or getting stuck in another universe seemed too simplistic.Seeing Professor Beast was surprising and pleasing. The X-Men era is beginning, and despite the poor productions, I'm excited. Brie Larson was good again, carrying her character well. The scene with Monica, Kamala, Danvers vs Dar-Benn was good, thankfully without music. However, despite not being a fan of Kamala Khan, her origin is preserved, and it's not bad. But I feel there's a lack of harmony among our main three characters, and I believe it's a script issue, not an actor one.While I like the idea of saving a planet by traveling through different planets, I didn't like the execution at all. Presenting such a serious and contemporary issue as if it's the simplest thing with childlike music seems somewhat unserious to me.However it turns out, this film paved the way for others and served as a stepping stone. Hopefully, with Beast in Deadpool 3, the overall MCU storyline will improve, abandoning mediocrity urgently; otherwise, it will continue to receive poor ratings.Note: I forgot to mention in the review, but Goose is a fantastic character, and I hope we continue to see this adorable cat. The scene with all the cats was genuinely entertaining, one of the enjoyable moments in 4-5 scenes."
"Marvels","alensufli","8 November 2023",210,"Even writing a review is extremely pointless as we all knew what we were expecting months before but here I am. They even themselves admitted it. The film is a huge disappointment. The plot is all over the place. Actions sequences were sometimes good but sometime were so dumb I didn't know where to look, where to pay attention. I like how they tried to catch the old marvel magic. Yes. They tried. But they utterly failed. Feige pulled off ""wait until the post credit scene to get excited cuz the film itself is boring"" trick again. And it wasn't a ""wow"" for me at least. The theatre was silent throughout and after the film. No one even made a giggling sound. Dead silence. Jokes were landing facedown to the ground every time a character made one. That's right. Every character there is comic relief. And I absolutely don't wanna talk about acting."
"Marvels","S3pt3m63r","18 November 2023",NA,"Unfortunately if you haven't got Disney plus and you don't keep to speed with the tv series, then you this movie won't make much sense as it relies on you knowing what's going on in that universe so far, which I'm not up to date with and involves the Miss Marvels characters which haven't been introduced in the movies. Confusing.I had hoped that following Guardians 3 it could've get much worse for the Marvel universe, at least Guardians has Rocket😂It's hard to find any plot to this movie. Carol Danvers (Captain Marvel) does throw a lot of people through the roof but the plot is a quantum entanglement mess. The movie is blissfully short but feels longer as it's so bad and some people walked out of the theatre. I was so pleasantly when it ended.I think it's about to retire the whole Marvel superhero franchise as this phase is going badly."
"Marvels","nscoby93","10 November 2023",210,"I actually had no intention of watching this film in theaters. Originally, I was just going to wait for its home release on Disney Plus, but after recently rewatching WandaVision, I genuinely wanted to see how they would handle Monica Rambeau and see what they would do with her.So I'll mention the positives for this film first...The movie is actually pretty, I really enjoyed the film aesthetically it looked good. This is very surprising to say as recent Marvel projects are tremendous eye sores.The films central characters, Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) and Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani), were surprisingly good. I had fully anticipated to dislike Captain Marvel and Ms Marvel in this film but I surprisingly enjoyed them both which is a big compliment coming from me, and Monica Rambeau is my favorite of the three she was good as I expected and anticipated. All three actresses gave enjoyable performances, and they all worked well together on screen.Then, of course, Samuel Jackson is always great! And the return of everyone's favorite Flerken kitty Goose. She had a great sequence that I refuse to spoil, but it had me dying. Goose saved this film!And well that's it...This film is just bad. Bad writing, bad pacing, bad storytelling. Nothing in this film is properly set up as it rushes through its 1 hour and 45 minute run time. Which is quite frankly fine for me as I genuinely did not want more of this.This movie as a whole is just overwhelmingly safe. It has no stakes, takes no risks, and does nothing. But there is actual enjoyment in its failings. It was so bad that it was good. The amount of eye rolling, face palms, and sighs I gave through this film was astonishing. I gave up on this film within the first 30 minutes, and afterward, that's when the enjoyment began because of how bad it went on to be.Then suddenly, out of nowhere, the film became a musical? Like what is happening? This film is so chaotic and unstructured. It just never stopped.The film had a good mid-credit scene so you know stay for that. Unfortunately, it was spoiled for me, so it didn't hit as hard as it could have. Especially if you're a fan of the actor who originally played the character the scene introduces.But The Marvels was exactly what I anticipated it to be, a below average dump. Which is a shame because they play with some interesting concepts in this film, but they do nothing with them, or they are just poorly handled. I can at least say I didn't hate this movie. Unfortunately, I just enjoyed it for all the wrong reasons.IMDb: 3/10

Once you get over its not adding anything or revealing any easter eggs, you can enjoy it for what it is.All three main characters deliver on their role, and it improves on captain marvels solo outing. Sit down take any preconceived ideas you have, remove any anticipation of easter eggs and enjoy it for what it is.Has marvel lost its way, yes.

"Marvels","brentsbulletinboard","11 November 2023",510,"When I first heard the title of this movie, I thought it was about a 1960s girls' singing group. And, frankly, that would have probably made for a better movie. Writer-director Nia DaCosta's third feature outing and the latest in the Marvel Universe paradigm is a wildly inconsistent superhero movie that tries too hard to do too much and doesn't have a script to support it. Too many of its plot elements aren't adequately explained until well into the story, while others aren't explained at all, leaving viewers who aren't comic book laureates wondering what's going on (particularly at film's end). Meanwhile, other narrative aspects frequently appear gimmicky and grow old quickly, such as the introduction of the primary superpower that its three protagonists share, one that almost becomes slapstickish after an all-too-brief while. On top of that, the CGI effects vacillate from one end of the quality spectrum to the other, creating a mix of images that are either startling to look at or stunningly cheesy at best. Add to that a villain that isn't particularly menacing, along with attempts at humor that either succeed brilliantly (cat lovers take note) or fall flat and look incredibly lame (as aficionados of musical theater will undoubtedly attest), all of which further add to the picture's pervasive inconsistency. The inclusion of ample clues for advancing the overarching Marvel Universe storyline continues here, too, furthering a trend that's growing tiresome in the studio's releases, a development akin to the ""Paul is dead"" legacy come to life with every passing picture. Then there's the trio of heroes themselves, who often appear more like they've been plucked from a giddy slumber party flick or a Cyndi Lauper video than taking center stage as seriously empowered champions in an action-adventure offering. All of these failings combine to make this production more of a forgettable placeholder in the Marvel mythology than a standalone feature (not to mention a pale substitute for a sequel to the far-superior film that launched the Captain Marvel franchise in 2019). In short, ""The Marvels"" is as much of a mess as it is a movie, and that's troubling for several reasons. It lends credence to the growing criticism that films like this aren't to be taken seriously. It reinforces the notion that they're cookie-cutter in nature, easily interchangeable with one another. And it raises questions about the career choices of lead actress Brie Larson, who, though quite capable of playing roles like these, is running the risk of becoming type-cast, a troubling prospect for an Academy Award-winning actress who possesses a depth of talent and is handily adept at taking on better and more serious material than this. In the wake of this release, Marvel Studios should take a step back and seriously assess where its future is headed, especially if movies like this are any indication. As pictures like ""Wakanda Forever"" (2022) show, the studio is capable of better work - and it's time to show viewers that."
"Marvels","Sleepin_Dragon","10 November 2023",410,"Carol Danvers is attempting to save the universe, but her incredible powers become entangled with those of Kamala Khan and Monica Rambeau, they must unite to save the world.Ouch, what can you say, this is surely one of Marvel's lowest points, I honestly don't know who the target audience is, or who this is going to appeal to, young teens only maybe? Anyhow, this was an absolute mess.The writing was clearly problematic, it doesn't gel, it is genuinely all over the place. I do very much wonder if huge sections of this film cut? It can be the only answer, it just doesn't flow at all, and that short run time...Special effects, some were pretty good, some were poor, I just wish there was a greater focus on plot, it just seemed like 100 minutes of CGI, noise and random events.Brie Larson, I'm not sure about you, but to me she looked totally disinterested and bored by the whole thing, what I didn't see, was someone committed to the role. I thought Samuel Jackson was rather good, but again poorly served by the script.It didn't look great from the trailers, and in reality, it's another clunker from Marvel Studios.4/10."

For me I was hoping for something that children and adults could enjoy. But, no only kids will enjoy this silly mess.I enjoyed the Captain Marvel movie and thought the criticism was not warranted. I also loved Wanda Vision and the introduction of Monica Rambeau and I was hoping for at least a good continuation of her story. I didn't watch Ms. Marvel because I'm not a teen and I knew it wasn't for me; and after watching her parts in this movie I'm glad I stuck to that.All three actresses are good and of course Samuel L in always a pleasure to see, but none of the other characters including the so-called villain were the least bit interesting. Most of the scenes were just downright silly. I hope they continue Monica's story with better writing and I wish Marvel would stop being silly and go back to making movies for adults and kids."
"Marvels","isaacsundaralingam","11 November 2023",310,"The MCU has absolutely overstayed its welcome. Post Avengers Endgame, these projects have been feeling more and more like content than cinema (except the rare surprises like GOTG 3). Superhero fatigue, they call it and this movie does practically nothing but to amp it up to 11.You watch the trailer, you know what happens. You bet on originality, you end up homeless. There's nothing new for me to say that I haven't already said about any of the other MCU content as of late. It's so generic that I'm confident a year from now, no one would remember this movie even existed. With every new MCU project, the jokes-per-minute ratio keeps getting worse, the villains are a writer's version of a stock photograph (I can't even remember the villain's name in this movie and it hasn't even been a day since I watched it), the CGI is so out there you can almost see the CGI artists' tears on screen, and it's getting more and more difficult to tell each MCU project apart cos they're all just the same.The only few positives I can identify here are actresses Iman Vellani and Brie Larson (Larson, who seems much more relaxed and settled into her superhero boots), and maybe the flashy action sequences. Otherwise, there's nothing here to watch, nothing here to experience and nothing here to enjoy. What a shame."
"Marvels","MrDHWong","9 November 2023",410,"""The Marvels"" is the sequel to 2019's ""Captain Marvel"", a continuation of the Disney+ series ""Ms. Marvel"", and the 33rd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris, and Iman Vellani, it represents a painful look at the downward spiral the MCU has found itself caught in since the end of Phase 3.Sometime after the events of ""Captain Marvel"", Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) has unintentionally started a civil war among the alien race known as the Kree. The leader of the Kree, Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton), soon finds one half of the Quantum Bands and later seeks out the other half, which is in the possession of Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel (Iman Vellani). At the request of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Carol teams up with Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) to negotiate peace among the Kree, but as the two investigate a wormhole in outer space, Monica, Carol, and Kamala start mysteriously switching powers with one another. Realising something is amiss, the trio are forced to work together to figure out what is causing this strange phenomena and hopefully put a stop to both Dar-Benn and the warring Kree.It's becoming harder and harder to call myself fan of the MCU, given the array of serviceable to terrible projects they have been churning out lately. To be fair though, it is a tall order to top something as ambitious as the culmination of over ten years worth of universe building after both ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and ""Avengers: Endgame"" pulled it off so effectively years ago. For the longest time, I have been willing to defend the post-Endgame MCU for trying different things, as I was under the impression that all of this would be leading to exciting new projects on the horizon. However, after sitting through ""The Marvels"", I can say with a hint of heartbreak that practically all of my optimism for the MCU's future has all but disappeared, as it contains next to nothing worth defending from a creative standpoint.Perhaps the best way to describe my viewing experience with this film would be ""apathetic"", because at no point does it ever feel like anything important is at stake. This is mainly due to either our three heroes being too overpowered or there not being enough information provided about the ones who need saving. Whenever a horde of enemies are swarming the trio, we watch as the three of them effortlessly take them out without even breaking a sweat. Action-packed moments like these that once elicited excitement have now been reduced to a series of bland fistfights and generic CGI blasts that have all been done before in better MCU films.We see Carol Danvers quickly blast everyone away with her energy beams and block punches with her hands, never once showing any signs that she is in real danger. Her accomplice Monica Rambeau does pretty much the same thing, only with less time on screen. Even Kamala Khan, who is the biggest fish-out-of-water in this situation, has no major trouble dealing with foes coming at her from every angle, always using her half of the Quantum Band to her advantage. How is it possible to keep the audience on their toes if the enemy forces are so inefficient that even an inexperienced child can wipe the floor with them this easily? On that note, it also doesn't help that none of these three heroes appear to have any physical weaknesses or personal insecurities holding them back, which causes all of the tension to evaporate instantly.In addition to this, we are barely shown anything interesting about the Kree that will keep the audience invested in their role in the story. As far as the film is concerned, they are nothing more than a stock species of extraterrestrials that are causing problems simply because the plot demands it. The original ""Captain Marvel"" film established that the Kree were the ones who inadvertently gave Carol her powers and took her in among them. Yet, this film never reminds the audience of that, instead opting to throw them right into the thick of the conflict without any important context. As a result, I just did not care at all about what happened to any of these people.It's also worth mentioning that this film is rife with obvious re-edits and tonal inconsistencies. One scene where this is most evident is where Carol Danvers is opening up to both Rambeau and Khan about her relationship with the Kree. What could have been a good method of showcasing Danvers's humanity is instead brushed aside for something completely unrelated after less than two minutes. I couldn't help but assume that this scene was supposed to go on much longer but was cut in post production for whatever reason. To add insult to injury, the scene is then immediately followed by a strange attempt at comic relief which fails to raise even a single laugh. Although Marvel films are known for their blending of comedy with drama, a moment like this felt like a rather tacky addition to the film that only hampers the already poor narrative structure. Worse still, there are other similar occurrences like this throughout the rest of the story.One of the biggest problems with the original ""Captain Marvel"" film was how weakly written the title character was, with her lack of likeable character traits and overly serious demeanour being a major reason why she is not viewed favourably by fans. You'd expect the filmmakers to remedy this problem for the sequel, but you would be wrong. I'm not sure whether it's Brie Larson's underwhelming performance or just plain old bad writing but I have never once felt any fondness for Carol Danvers as a person. As mentioned above, she efficiently fights her way through many bad guys with no issue whatsoever, never once showing any emotional weakness or other potential vulnerabilities. Because of this, Carol Danvers never feels like a real person, being nothing more than a one-dimensional superhero that is practically impossible for anybody to identify with. Her character has not changed or grown since the first film, and it looks like she won't be doing so anytime soon.I keep trying to remind myself of Monica Rambeau's contribution to the story but nothing memorable ever comes to mind without doing some kind of online research. Like Brie Larson, there is nothing especially remarkable about Teyonah Parris's performance, as her character is as bland as she comes. Though it is established that Rambeau looked up to Carol Danvers as a child, her role in this story is nothing more than playing second fiddle to an already dull lead protagonist. Yes, Rambeau is very strong and yes, she is more than capable of taking care of herself in a fight, but beyond that what else does she offer? Most of the time she just goes along with Danvers's orders without ever questioning her or giving her personal opinions, making her nothing more than a blind follower. I was hoping to have seen some kind of opposing dynamic between Danvers and Rambeau, as that would have given their characters an important amount of depth the distinguish the two from one another. No such luck I'm afraid.The only character I sort of cared about was Kamala Khan, whose childlike naiveté made her the most relatable of the three leads. In her feature film debut, Iman Vellani does carry over many of Khan's human traits from the Disney+ series ""Ms. Marvel"", being that she's still young and coming to terms with mastering her powers. Unfortunately, she does not achieve this through the character herself, but rather due to how woefully underwritten her two co-stars are in comparison. I wanted to see the three as kindred spirits, fighting as trio but standing out as individuals. Instead, all we get are two dull, stoic, overpowered adults and a young kid working together for no other reason than because the writers said so.As depressing as it sounds, the once mighty MCU is showing no signs of improvement as ""The Marvels"" just may be the worst film in the series so far. There simply isn't enough reason to justify its existence outside of some kind of contractual obligation by the higher ups at Disney, and I fully respect many people's decision to skip it altogether. At this point, I seriously doubt the MCU can ever return to its former glory, as this film is set to become the series' biggest box office bomb to date. I can only hope in vain that Disney will learn an important lesson from this film's failure, but knowing their track record that seems unlikely.I rate it 4/10."
"Marvels","danieljfarthing","9 January 2024",110,"2019's ""Captain Marvel"" wasn't too bad, for a superhero movie, but its sequel ""The Marvels"" is an unmitigated stinking disaster - the WORST Marvel movie to date (which is saying something). Set a decade or two after the original, Brie Larson (via Samuel L Jackson) teams somewhat inadvertently with Teyonah Parris & Iman Vellani (awful) to save Gary Lewis' people (what happened to previous leader Ben Mendelsohn?!) from evil Zawe Ashton. Director Nia DaCosta (who also co-wrote this tripe with Megan McDonnell & Elissa Karasik) creates a headache inducing, fast (as if bizarrely sped up), frantic, thoroughly annoying, tiresome piece of garbage. Absolutely dreadful."

Marvel did a fantastic job over the decade, earned trust of fans besides billions of dollars and they are wasting it like there is no tomorrow.I don't know how a franchise can change so drastically from hero to zero.I have watched every marvel movie out there and this is equally as bad as she-hulk.Story is definitely boring, protagonists are boring, antagonist is boring, action is boring, battles are boring, some scenes are absurd and ridiculous.I have absolutely nothing good to say about this movie. Don't waste your money or your time.Looks like the movie is only made to make money in India."
"Marvels","ThereelscoopwithKK","10 November 2023",110,"This second installment makes the original Captain Marvel look like a cinematic masterpiece... Nothing about this movie works. Although Brie Larson's acting has improved over the years it feels like she doesn't want to be there for this at all. Further, when you break it down, there is really no story at all happening. In fact, the solution to the entire problem is so extremely simple and solvable that you really wonder why there was a conflict in the first place. So much of everything is unexplained and eventually you stop trying to figure it out because you eventually lose all interest . Samuel L Jackson's character , Nick Fury, is hardly even a shell of his former self and is essentially now demoted to comedic relief.The scenes don't really mesh together at all. None of them are really necessary to advancing a plot and all feature the same repeated choreographic battle. The villain lacks any real charisma and is only provided a very brief backstory. Overall she never feels like too much of a threat.There's one part in particular that I think is absolutely a candidate for worst sequence of 2023. Without spoiling it , it is essentially a planet that looks like a cheap rip off of the Wizard of Oz. It just captures all of the problems with this movie into one scene. There's been a lot of less than stellar work from Marvel since endgame, but this is reaching new depths.I'm not even going to get started on the cats scene with the theme song....Please Loki, reset the entire timeline."
"Marvels","Avwillfan89","23 December 2023",110,"This film is somehow way more depressing and worse than Ant Man Quantumania. We honestly thought Eternals was bad, but that was only the beginning. It was only going to go downhill from there.Watching this movie felt like watching a beloved friend in a coma fighting for her life. It was sad, frustrating and ultimately hopeless. So much potential squandered right before our very eyes.Much has been said about the Girl Power aspect of this story, but it doesn't mean jack when the characters are so thinly written. After the big character tension build up between Carol and Monica, with the latter resenting her for not coming back, their fractures mend themselves very quickly. There is no chemistry between the the two at all.The villain is Bland with a capitol B, and highly forgettable.Nick Fury is actually pathetic in this movie. He doesn't at all act like the Fury we know and love. He was more in character in Far From Home when Talos was impersonating him!I don't think I've ever had this much of a bad experience with a film since Cats. And it is telling that there actually features a ludicrous scene involving baby flerkens and the song Memory.What the actual hell, Marvel?The only good thing is that it is mercifully short, and Iman Vellani does seem to be enjoying herself in the role.Once a great studio, brought crumbling down on itself. If I could give it zero stars, I would."
"Marvels","chenp-54708","10 November 2023",210,"Marvel movies really have fallen apart haven't they? This is definitely one of the worst Marvels movie I have seen out of all the Marvel movies I had watched. There really isn't too much to say about the movie because ""The Marvels"" is pretty much like almost every single Marvel movie but the writing, humor, direction, and performances are pretty much all over the place. Director Nia DaCosta has made ""Little Woods"" which I liked but her direction here is pretty bad and goes all over the place.The special effects are kind of rough on the edges, the actions and thrills were just okay and the performances, despite a pretty good cast, they aren't very good. Brie Larson is an actress I like but unfortunately her performance felt weak and lacking. The other performances as well including the child performances. The story isn't interesting as the writing is pretty bland and none of the characters were interesting. With a short runtime, the movie surprisingly was really boring.I do like superhero movies but it seems this one really just sucked. Overall, it's bad."
"Marvels","kevin_robbins","12 November 2023",310,"My wife and I recently caught Marvel's (2023) in theaters. The plot revolves around Captain Marvel's mistake in choosing sides during a battle, disrupting the cosmic balance. Two young ladies gain powers in the process, and Captain Marvel must collaborate with them to rectify her error and restore equilibrium to the universe.Directed by Nia DaCosta (Candyman) and featuring Brie Larson (Lessons in Chemistry), Teyonah Parris (Dear White People), Iman Vellani (Ms. Marvel), Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction), and Zawe Ashton (Blitz).This film boasts clean and classic Marvel-style characters, cinematography, action scenes, and special effects. However, the plot seems somewhat lackluster, with Captain Marvel possibly appearing more as a villain than a hero. The backstories of the heroes lack sufficient development, making it challenging to form a connection with them. The cat steals the show initially but feels overdone by the end, and even Samuel L. Jackson's wit falls short of expectations.In summary, this superhero movie prioritizes its message over a compelling storyline. While the characters and visuals are in line with Marvel's trademark style, the plot may leave audiences indifferent. The lack of character depth and an engaging storyline earns this film a 3/10, making it a skip-worthy experience."
"Marvels","SHU_Movies","10 November 2023",310,"Going from the Loki Series Finale this morning to The Marvels this evening was (for lack of a better word) bonkers! The finale was perfect, and a beautiful ending to the show, while The Marvels is a complete mess. It's honestly given me whiplashThe Marvels is just an all-around bad movie. The script is awful and the story is super rushed and poorly executed, which both have an impact on how well the characters (and in-turn the actors) come-across on-screenThe action and humour are kind of alright, and the VFX are definitely better than anything we've seen in an MCU project since Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness (with the obvious exceptions of Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 and Loki Season 2), but that still doesn't exactly make it look greatThis movie is just painful to watch at points! Early on, it has some really fun moments, and felt like it could have actually been somewhat entertaining, but that feeling vanished as soon as it came. It's barley better than Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania, so you can do with that information what you will."
"Marvels","NanoFrog","16 January 2024",110,"So Stan Lee passes away and we get Disney now in full control of Marvel stories...and boy is there a difference. I could not finish watching this really bad film, it is just junk from scene to scene. The cast, I feel so sorry for them because the cast is a fine group for the most part...but the story, the effects, the directing are all jumbled up into a real mess. The premise is interesting but they have no idea what to do with it. I have never been a fan of Disney, maybe when I was 10 years old, back in the early 60s, but this is not at all Walt Disney. This is Disney INC and a massive number of talentless paperwork and book-keepers make their films these days. This is just junk slammed together by people who have no idea how to tell a story or stage intelligent effects. This film is not a Turkey, it is, in fact, just garbage. RIP MArvel."
"Marvels","OnlyAtJMart","12 November 2023",410,"Anyone who heard the news about this project knows that the production was a nightmare, and it shows in the final product here. It's like they couldn't figure out what direction to go, so they made 4 versions, and blended them together. Which would explain the high budget, the 5 delays, and the reshoots. Kamala's character was probably the best part of the movie. I promise you, the script did her no favors, but she stood out. Her acting was in line with her character. This was probably an exciting opportunity for her, and she wasn't going to let a bad script, and production problems stop her from giving a great effort. However, the story, the dialogue, the musical gimmick, the weak villain. It just didn't work. I don't think the blame lies solely with the actors, or even the director, who did lack the experience for helming a movie with a budget this size. I think Disney interfered heavily with the production, which almost always yields bad results. I think it was doomed to fail. They put so much pressure on this being successful, they forgot to make it coherent, unique, or interesting."
"Marvels","mildlyintrusive","13 November 2023",210,"Once in a while I tend to go to my local theater to check out something new, maybe a new release or a re-run of a movie. Today, I stumbled upon The Marvels, I thought ""Hey, I haven't been going to the theater this month that often, maybe I should try this out?"" And well, it seems that I'd made the wrong decision. The Marvels follows the titular Marvels trying to stop an evil Kree with one disadvantage however, every time they use their powers, it's Freaky Friday.Maybe its because of the very troubled production but everything just feels like an amalgamation of three separate movies, its like a ADHD experience. The movie does NOT take itself seriously at all, and as a result, it makes me hard to care for literally everything! Its like a circus act masquerading as a movie, it doesn't work! There were moments where characters were in danger and they start joking about it every opportunity they get. To add insult to injury was the treatment of the character of Nick Fury, who feels like a completely different character altogether, cracking lame after lame jokes every single time! Special effects were decent, but considering the massive 271M+ budget I wished they could've at least cared about the plot and flesh out some if the characters and their motivations instead of relying on action scene after action scene, it gets tiring after a while you know?Brie Larson herself looks tired and forced in this movie, her character also being this girl-boss who can sweep through enemies in this movie, no weaknesses and no vulnerabilities. It all feels so one-dimensional, it tries to be like a 80s action star with the likes of Arnold and co. But fails because they lack charisma and charm. Because of this I found it impossible to relate to her in any sense of way. Monica Rambeau wasn't trying her best here, and there is no opposing dynamic between the two to the point where I found her virtually indistinguishable from Mrs. Danvers herself. However I do commend Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan, whose child-like personality I was comfortable with and is the standout between the three leads but suffers from being very underwritten and the villain is a copy-and-paste from dozens we've seen before.Overall, a messy and disjointed movie with not much to offer rather than annoying, dreadful humor and some few flashy action scenes. It certainly feels like homework for the MCU as it struggles to keep a hook in something after the Infinity Saga. Skip this one and play with your action figures instead, Im sure it'll be better than this."
"Marvels","critic-97-417657","4 February 2024",810,"The movie was somewhat ridiculous, but I found myself giggling throughout it. It was actually quite fun. There were a lot of really charming things about this movie, and while the storyline lacked any real tension, I didn't really care. It was mostly about the character development, and the relationships between the three main characters. Overall, I just found it really fun and just didn't take it very seriously. In a lot of ways, it is a set up for the rest of the series, and is definitely not a standalone movie. And the post credit scene, amazing. Ties in a lot of potential for what they are going to be doing in this franchise."
"Marvels","The-Sarkologist","7 February 2024",710,"Well, I guess someone was right when they said that one of the big problems with this film was that you had to like watch 8 other films and 3 series to sort of understand what was going on. Mind you, I have actually done just that, but even then with the amount of time that had passed since I watched the other things it was still a little tricky understanding what was happening.Mind you, I did actually quite like the film. Like the scenes where they were switching places whenever they used their powers together, and also the big bad in the film, that was in part trying to save her people, but also attempting to punish Captain Marvel for what she had done to her people. Yeah, as it turned out, when she destroyed the great intelligence it sent the Kree into a massive civil war which basically destroyed their planet.So, if you had seen Miss Marvel, you will know that she has a thing for Captain Marvel, and of course it was always going to be a thing that she was eventually going to be involved in a team up. Also, there were some hints at the end that suggested that there was going to be another team-up film, though apparently that will still be some way off (and the problem will be that, no doubt, when they get around to it, all of them will be too old to be members of a possible Young Avengers - kids do grow up a little too fast).Yeah, I thought that this film was pretty good, though I have to agree that the problem is that you do need to catch up to speed to understand what is going on. Oh, it also seemed that it felt that it was a bit over the place, no doubt because they wanted to make the film shorter than a lot of the others. Still, it's good, especially if you are up to date on the films."
"Marvels","cherold","30 January 2024",710,"After the bad reviews, and considering how many bad superhero movies have come out lately, I would have skipped this one if the trailer didn't look like so much fun. Fortunately, the movie fulfills the trailer's promiseIn the movie, three superheroes with related powers find themselves suddenly swapping places with one another. The proves to be a good gimmick for both action and comedy, as the three keep finding themselves in one another's battles. Eventually, they master the situation in order to take down a very angry villain with an unusually sympathetic backstory.The movie leans heavily - and for the most part successfully - into the comedy. A big chunk of this is fueled by the teenage Captain Marvel fangirl Ms. Marvel, who is from a TV series I found too pre-teen-oriented to enjoy. Ms. Marvel's an annoying character but for the most part I found her amusing in this.There's also a funny gag with alien cats.While I enjoyed this movie, I have to admit its a bit of an unfocussed mess. There are a lot of elements just tossed in, like a whole thing with Marvel #3, Monica, dealing with her abandonment issues. These occasional ""emotional"" moments don't much interest me.Anyway, a lot of people hate this, but if you like the trailer, I'd say chance the movie (I did not take a chance on the last Aquaman movie because unlike The Marvels, the trailer looked just as bad as people said the movie was.Going against the current, I say if you want a bunch of comedy and some fun action then you should watch this one."
"Marvels","drawlife","8 November 2023",510,"THE MARVELS is here and it's a mashed up film that is totally all over the place. It feels as if this film was edited and chopped into pieces during post and it shows.Couple things I enjoyed, I did like seeing Carol Danvers and Monica Rambeau resolve and acknowledge their relationship, but due to the nature of their characters being straight arrows, it allows Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan to be the audience just as Tom Holland's Peter Parker was in CIVIL WAR. I did not particularly enjoy the MS. MARVEL series, but I can see her being the shoutout for many.I think the script just touched on the surface of Brie Larson's Captain Marvel herself, so diving into her more is a plus, however the story did her no favors once again and I did feel like she was given like four or five pieces of direction to portray her character compared to the more one-note performance in the first film. Teyonah Parris is commendable. She was the more science-y of the trio.Samuel L. Jackson just feels inconsistent especially after SECRET INVASION. Feels like this Nick Fury is a variant. He's simply passing through in this film.Another thing I liked was the incursions (also briefly touched on in DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS). We all complained about the lack of planting seeds for the future leading into KANG DYNASTY and SECRET WARS. Finally, this film it at least preps and teases what's to come down the line.The MCU's villain problem is a long known fact, but here it only cements their problem even further. Now I'm a fan of Lee Pace's over the top performance as Ronan, but Dar-Benn played by Zawe Ashton is literally a copy and paste of Ronan, but female. Nothing new about it. Definitely up there as one of the worst villains in the MCU.The power swaps were kinda cool so I can give it that. Nia DaCosta does a good job executing the fight scenes, but again as one should expect, VFX is meh. Now if you cringed during the musical note duel between the two Doctor Strange, then wait till you see one segment of the film where it feels like a misplaced musical. Lots of quirky and annoying humor like one should expect in an MCU film.The Skrulls are in the film and as a fan we always think we can write the better film after watching it, but I just DO NOT understand why this sequel couldn't have been SECRET INVASION(one of the worst MCU Disney+ shows). SECRET INVASION honestly should have been an Avengers film or at the very least a Captain Marvel sequel co-starring some Avengers, kinda like CIVIL WAR. I personally feel like that dilemma could have furthered Captain Marvel's development due to her involvement with them and how she's equally to blame for not helping them out when she and Fury promised to find them a home. But instead she's stuck with this material.The mid-credit scene is arguably the best part. Once again teasing things to come. It's stuff that like that, that will maybe still garner interest in the MCU despite its current fall from grace. The end-credit scene is alright. Not particularly jazzed about that promise down the line.On that note, the recent Variety article published about Marvel Studios talked about their behind the scenes trouble. It was said that Kevin Feige and his creative committee partook in their yearly Palm Springs retreat to regroup and refocus, so here's hoping to next year being more consistent with quality. Seemed like he was spread too thin with the mandate to have more quantity than quality.THE MARVELS is a season 1.5 for MS. MARVEL and a CAPTAIN MARVEL sequel that we never saw due to the flashbacks and exposition to explain things. And let's be clear, at this point everything feels like homework. That was going to be inevitable moving forward after INFINITY WAR and ENDGAMGE, but especially when Disney+ was announced making Kevin Feige spread out too thin. But it only feels like homework because everything that has been released is below the standard of what Marvel set up for us.So to sum it up, while I did find it slightly more appealing than the first CAPTAIN MARVEL and QUANTUMANIA, that isn't saying much. Low expectations definitely helped. Is THE MARVELS one of the worst? No, but it definitely belongs way down below the list.5/10."
"Marvels","tibby_23","17 January 2024",410,"By far the worst Marvel movie so far, I am extremely disappointed. After the mess that Thor 4 was, I was hoping that Marvel learned its lesson, but it seems not. I am honestly happy this movie did bad at the box office, that's what you get for ruining such a great character (I loved Cpt. Marvel from the comics).What makes it bad:
Action moves way too fast from one scene to anotherNo character improvement or growth by the end of the movieThings just happen with no storytellingNot serious enough, too childish for my tasteToo many goofy moments (singing, really? We've come this low, Marvel?)End scenes that try to set the context for next movies seem forced and unnecessaryI also found two good things eventually:
I liked the villain and her story, sympathized with her a bitAt least the movie was not long.These writers should never be hired again."
"Marvels","olcare","10 November 2023",410,"Criticizing specific parts of the movie became confusing for me as there were so many details I wanted to change. This film truly disappointed me, especially since my expectations were already low, and falling below them is a bad sign for Marvel. It had a Thor: Love and Thunder vibe, which I also disliked (4/10). I had been excited after watching Loki in the morning, but it was in vain.For me, the unbearable part was the music. After checking the playlists of movies I've watched for a long time, Marvel had by far the worst compositions. The music was exaggerated, drowning out the impact of fight scenes and making them unbearable. It was like overly noisy background music during a break.Another aspect I didn't like was the main villain. I can't believe Marvel fell into the same mistake again. The villain was poorly written, and Zawe Ashton's performance felt forced, appearing awkward in scenes. One major reason for this was the poor portrayal of the Kree Empire in the MCU. Neglecting the significance of the Kree made Supreme look bad. They could have explained the critical situation of the 'Hala' planet in the film's opening with a 30-35 minute sequence, providing context for the desperation of the Kree.Another thing I found absurd was Monica teleporting to a parallel universe. They portrayed the concept of parallel universes like child's play. Especially after watching Loki Season 2 in the morning, her randomly teleporting or getting stuck in another universe seemed too simplistic.Seeing Professor Beast was surprising and pleasing. The X-Men era is beginning, and despite the poor productions, I'm excited. Brie Larson was good again, carrying her character well. The scene with Monica, Kamala, Danvers vs Dar-Benn was good, thankfully without music. However, despite not being a fan of Kamala Khan, her origin is preserved, and it's not bad. But I feel there's a lack of harmony among our main three characters, and I believe it's a script issue, not an actor one.While I like the idea of saving a planet by traveling through different planets, I didn't like the execution at all. Presenting such a serious and contemporary issue as if it's the simplest thing with childlike music seems somewhat unserious to me.However it turns out, this film paved the way for others and served as a stepping stone. Hopefully, with Beast in Deadpool 3, the overall MCU storyline will improve, abandoning mediocrity urgently; otherwise, it will continue to receive poor ratings.Note: I forgot to mention in the review, but Goose is a fantastic character, and I hope we continue to see this adorable cat. The scene with all the cats was genuinely entertaining, one of the enjoyable moments in 4-5 scenes."
"Marvels","alensufli","8 November 2023",210,"Even writing a review is extremely pointless as we all knew what we were expecting months before but here I am. They even themselves admitted it. The film is a huge disappointment. The plot is all over the place. Actions sequences were sometimes good but sometime were so dumb I didn't know where to look, where to pay attention. I like how they tried to catch the old marvel magic. Yes. They tried. But they utterly failed. Feige pulled off ""wait until the post credit scene to get excited cuz the film itself is boring"" trick again. And it wasn't a ""wow"" for me at least. The theatre was silent throughout and after the film. No one even made a giggling sound. Dead silence. Jokes were landing facedown to the ground every time a character made one. That's right. Every character there is comic relief. And I absolutely don't wanna talk about acting."
"Marvels","S3pt3m63r","18 November 2023",NA,"Unfortunately if you haven't got Disney plus and you don't keep to speed with the tv series, then you this movie won't make much sense as it relies on you knowing what's going on in that universe so far, which I'm not up to date with and involves the Miss Marvels characters which haven't been introduced in the movies. Confusing.I had hoped that following Guardians 3 it could've get much worse for the Marvel universe, at least Guardians has Rocket😂It's hard to find any plot to this movie. Carol Danvers (Captain Marvel) does throw a lot of people through the roof but the plot is a quantum entanglement mess. The movie is blissfully short but feels longer as it's so bad and some people walked out of the theatre. I was so pleasantly when it ended.I think it's about to retire the whole Marvel superhero franchise as this phase is going badly."
"Marvels","nscoby93","10 November 2023",210,"I actually had no intention of watching this film in theaters. Originally, I was just going to wait for its home release on Disney Plus, but after recently rewatching WandaVision, I genuinely wanted to see how they would handle Monica Rambeau and see what they would do with her.So I'll mention the positives for this film first...The movie is actually pretty, I really enjoyed the film aesthetically it looked good. This is very surprising to say as recent Marvel projects are tremendous eye sores.The films central characters, Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) and Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani), were surprisingly good. I had fully anticipated to dislike Captain Marvel and Ms Marvel in this film but I surprisingly enjoyed them both which is a big compliment coming from me, and Monica Rambeau is my favorite of the three she was good as I expected and anticipated. All three actresses gave enjoyable performances, and they all worked well together on screen.Then, of course, Samuel Jackson is always great! And the return of everyone's favorite Flerken kitty Goose. She had a great sequence that I refuse to spoil, but it had me dying. Goose saved this film!And well that's it...This film is just bad. Bad writing, bad pacing, bad storytelling. Nothing in this film is properly set up as it rushes through its 1 hour and 45 minute run time. Which is quite frankly fine for me as I genuinely did not want more of this.This movie as a whole is just overwhelmingly safe. It has no stakes, takes no risks, and does nothing. But there is actual enjoyment in its failings. It was so bad that it was good. The amount of eye rolling, face palms, and sighs I gave through this film was astonishing. I gave up on this film within the first 30 minutes, and afterward, that's when the enjoyment began because of how bad it went on to be.Then suddenly, out of nowhere, the film became a musical? Like what is happening? This film is so chaotic and unstructured. It just never stopped.The film had a good mid-credit scene so you know stay for that. Unfortunately, it was spoiled for me, so it didn't hit as hard as it could have. Especially if you're a fan of the actor who originally played the character the scene introduces.But The Marvels was exactly what I anticipated it to be, a below average dump. Which is a shame because they play with some interesting concepts in this film, but they do nothing with them, or they are just poorly handled. I can at least say I didn't hate this movie. Unfortunately, I just enjoyed it for all the wrong reasons.IMDb: 3/10

Once you get over its not adding anything or revealing any easter eggs, you can enjoy it for what it is.All three main characters deliver on their role, and it improves on captain marvels solo outing. Sit down take any preconceived ideas you have, remove any anticipation of easter eggs and enjoy it for what it is.Has marvel lost its way, yes. Have the glorious days of intertwined writing and on screen narrative been left behind, yes, but as a movie its fun."
"Marvels","brentsbulletinboard","11 November 2023",510,"When I first heard the title of this movie, I thought it was about a 1960s girls' singing group. And, frankly, that would have probably made for a better movie. Writer-director Nia DaCosta's third feature outing and the latest in the Marvel Universe paradigm is a wildly inconsistent superhero movie that tries too hard to do too much and doesn't have a script to support it. Too many of its plot elements aren't adequately explained until well into the story, while others aren't explained at all, leaving viewers who aren't comic book laureates wondering what's going on (particularly at film's end). Meanwhile, other narrative aspects frequently appear gimmicky and grow old quickly, such as the introduction of the primary superpower that its three protagonists share, one that almost becomes slapstickish after an all-too-brief while. On top of that, the CGI effects vacillate from one end of the quality spectrum to the other, creating a mix of images that are either startling to look at or stunningly cheesy at best. Add to that a villain that isn't particularly menacing, along with attempts at humor that either succeed brilliantly (cat lovers take note) or fall flat and look incredibly lame (as aficionados of musical theater will undoubtedly attest), all of which further add to the picture's pervasive inconsistency. The inclusion of ample clues for advancing the overarching Marvel Universe storyline continues here, too, furthering a trend that's growing tiresome in the studio's releases, a development akin to the ""Paul is dead"" legacy come to life with every passing picture. Then there's the trio of heroes themselves, who often appear more like they've been plucked from a giddy slumber party flick or a Cyndi Lauper video than taking center stage as seriously empowered champions in an action-adventure offering. All of these failings combine to make this production more of a forgettable placeholder in the Marvel mythology than a standalone feature (not to mention a pale substitute for a sequel to the far-superior film that launched the Captain Marvel franchise in 2019). In short, ""The Marvels"" is as much of a mess as it is a movie, and that's troubling for several reasons. It lends credence to the growing criticism that films like this aren't to be taken seriously. It reinforces the notion that they're cookie-cutter in nature, easily interchangeable with one another. And it raises questions about the career choices of lead actress Brie Larson, who, though quite capable of playing roles like these, is running the risk of becoming type-cast, a troubling prospect for an Academy Award-winning actress who possesses a depth of talent and is handily adept at taking on better and more serious material than this. In the wake of this release, Marvel Studios should take a step back and seriously assess where its future is headed, especially if movies like this are any indication. As pictures like ""Wakanda Forever"" (2022) show, the studio is capable of better work - and it's time to show viewers that."
"Marvels","Sleepin_Dragon","10 November 2023",410,"Carol Danvers is attempting to save the universe, but her incredible powers become entangled with those of Kamala Khan and Monica Rambeau, they must unite to save the world.Ouch, what can you say, this is surely one of Marvel's lowest points, I honestly don't know who the target audience is, or who this is going to appeal to, young teens only maybe? Anyhow, this was an absolute mess.The writing was clearly problematic, it doesn't gel, it is genuinely all over the place. I do very much wonder if huge sections of this film cut? It can be the only answer, it just doesn't flow at all, and that short run time...Special effects, some were pretty good, some were poor, I just wish there was a greater focus on plot, it just seemed like 100 minutes of CGI, noise and random events.Brie Larson, I'm not sure about you, but to me she looked totally disinterested and bored by the whole thing, what I didn't see, was someone committed to the role. I thought Samuel Jackson was rather good, but again poorly served by the script.It didn't look great from the trailers, and in reality, it's another clunker from Marvel Studios.4/10."
"Marvels","judywalker2","14 December 2023",510,"Went to see this movie with my 17- and 11-year-old granddaughters. One is a Ms. Marvel fan and the other is now. For me I was hoping for something that children and adults could enjoy. But, no only kids will enjoy this silly mess.I enjoyed the Captain Marvel movie and thought the criticism was not warranted. I also loved Wanda Vision and the introduction of Monica Rambeau and I was hoping for at least a good continuation of her story. I didn't watch Ms. Marvel because I'm not a teen and I knew it wasn't for me; and after watching her parts in this movie I'm glad I stuck to that.All three actresses are good and of course Samuel L in always a pleasure to see, but none of the other characters including the so-called villain were the least bit interesting. Most of the scenes were just downright silly. I hope they continue Monica's story with better writing and I wish Marvel would stop being silly and go back to making movies for adults and kids."
"Marvels","isaacsundaralingam","11 November 2023",310,"The MCU has absolutely overstayed its welcome. Post Avengers Endgame, these projects have been feeling more and more like content than cinema (except the rare surprises like GOTG 3). Superhero fatigue, they call it and this movie does practically nothing but to amp it up to 11.You watch the trailer, you know what happens. You bet on originality, you end up homeless. There's nothing new for me to say that I haven't already said about any of the other MCU content as of late. It's so generic that I'm confident a year from now, no one would remember this movie even existed. With every new MCU project, the jokes-per-minute ratio keeps getting worse, the villains are a writer's version of a stock photograph (I can't even remember the villain's name in this movie and it hasn't even been a day since I watched it), the CGI is so out there you can almost see the CGI artists' tears on screen, and it's getting more and more difficult to tell each MCU project apart cos they're all just the same.The only few positives I can identify here are actresses Iman Vellani and Brie Larson (Larson, who seems much more relaxed and settled into her superhero boots), and maybe the flashy action sequences. Otherwise, there's nothing here to watch, nothing here to experience and nothing here to enjoy. What a shame."
"Marvels","MrDHWong","9 November 2023",410,"""The Marvels"" is the sequel to 2019's ""Captain Marvel"", a continuation of the Disney+ series ""Ms. Marvel"", and the 33rd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris, and Iman Vellani, it represents a painful look at the downward spiral the MCU has found itself caught in since the end of Phase 3.Sometime after the events of ""Captain Marvel"", Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) has unintentionally started a civil war among the alien race known as the Kree. The leader of the Kree, Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton), soon finds one half of the Quantum Bands and later seeks out the other half, which is in the possession of Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel (Iman Vellani). At the request of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Carol teams up with Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) to negotiate peace among the Kree, but as the two investigate a wormhole in outer space, Monica, Carol, and Kamala start mysteriously switching powers with one another. Realising something is amiss, the trio are forced to work together to figure out what is causing this strange phenomena and hopefully put a stop to both Dar-Benn and the warring Kree.It's becoming harder and harder to call myself fan of the MCU, given the array of serviceable to terrible projects they have been churning out lately. To be fair though, it is a tall order to top something as ambitious as the culmination of over ten years worth of universe building after both ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and ""Avengers: Endgame"" pulled it off so effectively years ago. For the longest time, I have been willing to defend the post-Endgame MCU for trying different things, as I was under the impression that all of this would be leading to exciting new projects on the horizon. However, after sitting through ""The Marvels"", I can say with a hint of heartbreak that practically all of my optimism for the MCU's future has all but disappeared, as it contains next to nothing worth defending from a creative standpoint.Perhaps the best way to describe my viewing experience with this film would be ""apathetic"", because at no point does it ever feel like anything important is at stake. This is mainly due to either our three heroes being too overpowered or there not being enough information provided about the ones who need saving. Whenever a horde of enemies are swarming the trio, we watch as the three of them effortlessly take them out without even breaking a sweat. Action-packed moments like these that once elicited excitement have now been reduced to a series of bland fistfights and generic CGI blasts that have all been done before in better MCU films.We see Carol Danvers quickly blast everyone away with her energy beams and block punches with her hands, never once showing any signs that she is in real danger. Her accomplice Monica Rambeau does pretty much the same thing, only with less time on screen. Even Kamala Khan, who is the biggest fish-out-of-water in this situation, has no major trouble dealing with foes coming at her from every angle, always using her half of the Quantum Band to her advantage. How is it possible to keep the audience on their toes if the enemy forces are so inefficient that even an inexperienced child can wipe the floor with them this easily? On that note, it also doesn't help that none of these three heroes appear to have any physical weaknesses or personal insecurities holding them back, which causes all of the tension to evaporate instantly.In addition to this, we are barely shown anything interesting about the Kree that will keep the audience invested in their role in the story. As far as the film is concerned, they are nothing more than a stock species of extraterrestrials that are causing problems simply because the plot demands it. The original ""Captain Marvel"" film established that the Kree were the ones who inadvertently gave Carol her powers and took her in among them. Yet, this film never reminds the audience of that, instead opting to throw them right into the thick of the conflict without any important context. As a result, I just did not care at all about what happened to any of these people.It's also worth mentioning that this film is rife with obvious re-edits and tonal inconsistencies. One scene where this is most evident is where Carol Danvers is opening up to both Rambeau and Khan about her relationship with the Kree. What could have been a good method of showcasing Danvers's humanity is instead brushed aside for something completely unrelated after less than two minutes. I couldn't help but assume that this scene was supposed to go on much longer but was cut in post production for whatever reason. To add insult to injury, the scene is then immediately followed by a strange attempt at comic relief which fails to raise even a single laugh. Although Marvel films are known for their blending of comedy with drama, a moment like this felt like a rather tacky addition to the film that only hampers the already poor narrative structure. Worse still, there are other similar occurrences like this throughout the rest of the story.One of the biggest problems with the original ""Captain Marvel"" film was how weakly written the title character was, with her lack of likeable character traits and overly serious demeanour being a major reason why she is not viewed favourably by fans. You'd expect the filmmakers to remedy this problem for the sequel, but you would be wrong. I'm not sure whether it's Brie Larson's underwhelming performance or just plain old bad writing but I have never once felt any fondness for Carol Danvers as a person. As mentioned above, she efficiently fights her way through many bad guys with no issue whatsoever, never once showing any emotional weakness or other potential vulnerabilities. Because of this, Carol Danvers never feels like a real person, being nothing more than a one-dimensional superhero that is practically impossible for anybody to identify with. Her character has not changed or grown since the first film, and it looks like she won't be doing so anytime soon.I keep trying to remind myself of Monica Rambeau's contribution to the story but nothing memorable ever comes to mind without doing some kind of online research. Like Brie Larson, there is nothing especially remarkable about Teyonah Parris's performance, as her character is as bland as she comes. Though it is established that Rambeau looked up to Carol Danvers as a child, her role in this story is nothing more than playing second fiddle to an already dull lead protagonist. Yes, Rambeau is very strong and yes, she is more than capable of taking care of herself in a fight, but beyond that what else does she offer? Most of the time she just goes along with Danvers's orders without ever questioning her or giving her personal opinions, making her nothing more than a blind follower. I was hoping to have seen some kind of opposing dynamic between Danvers and Rambeau, as that would have given their characters an important amount of depth the distinguish the two from one another. No such luck I'm afraid.The only character I sort of cared about was Kamala Khan, whose childlike naiveté made her the most relatable of the three leads. In her feature film debut, Iman Vellani does carry over many of Khan's human traits from the Disney+ series ""Ms. Marvel"", being that she's still young and coming to terms with mastering her powers. Unfortunately, she does not achieve this through the character herself, but rather due to how woefully underwritten her two co-stars are in comparison. I wanted to see the three as kindred spirits, fighting as trio but standing out as individuals. Instead, all we get are two dull, stoic, overpowered adults and a young kid working together for no other reason than because the writers said so.As depressing as it sounds, the once mighty MCU is showing no signs of improvement as ""The Marvels"" just may be the worst film in the series so far. There simply isn't enough reason to justify its existence outside of some kind of contractual obligation by the higher ups at Disney, and I fully respect many people's decision to skip it altogether. At this point, I seriously doubt the MCU can ever return to its former glory, as this film is set to become the series' biggest box office bomb to date. I can only hope in vain that Disney will learn an important lesson from this film's failure, but knowing their track record that seems unlikely.I rate it 4/10."
"Marvels","danieljfarthing","9 January 2024",110,"2019's ""Captain Marvel"" wasn't too bad, for a superhero movie, but its sequel ""The Marvels"" is an unmitigated stinking disaster - the WORST Marvel movie to date (which is saying something). Set a decade or two after the original, Brie Larson (via Samuel L Jackson) teams somewhat inadvertently with Teyonah Parris & Iman Vellani (awful) to save Gary Lewis' people (what happened to previous leader Ben Mendelsohn?!) from evil Zawe Ashton. Director Nia DaCosta (who also co-wrote this tripe with Megan McDonnell & Elissa Karasik) creates a headache inducing, fast (as if bizarrely sped up), frantic, thoroughly annoying, tiresome piece of garbage. Absolutely dreadful."

Marvel did a fantastic job over the decade, earned trust of fans besides billions of dollars and they are wasting it like there is no tomorrow.I don't know how a franchise can change so drastically from hero to zero.I have watched every marvel movie out there and this is equally as bad as she-hulk.Story is definitely boring, protagonists are boring, antagonist is boring, action is boring, battles are boring, some scenes are absurd and ridiculous.I have absolutely nothing good to say about this movie. Don't waste your money or your time.Looks like the movie is only made to make money in India."
"Marvels","ThereelscoopwithKK","10 November 2023",110,"This second installment makes the original Captain Marvel look like a cinematic masterpiece... Nothing about this movie works. Although Brie Larson's acting has improved over the years it feels like she doesn't want to be there for this at all. Further, when you break it down, there is really no story at all happening. In fact, the solution to the entire problem is so extremely simple and solvable that you really wonder why there was a conflict in the first place. So much of everything is unexplained and eventually you stop trying to figure it out because you eventually lose all interest . Samuel L Jackson's character , Nick Fury, is hardly even a shell of his former self and is essentially now demoted to comedic relief.The scenes don't really mesh together at all. None of them are really necessary to advancing a plot and all feature the same repeated choreographic battle. The villain lacks any real charisma and is only provided a very brief backstory. Overall she never feels like too much of a threat.There's one part in particular that I think is absolutely a candidate for worst sequence of 2023. Without spoiling it , it is essentially a planet that looks like a cheap rip off of the Wizard of Oz. It just captures all of the problems with this movie into one scene. There's been a lot of less than stellar work from Marvel since endgame, but this is reaching new depths.I'm not even going to get started on the cats scene with the theme song....Please Loki, reset the entire timeline."
"Marvels","Avwillfan89","23 December 2023",110,"This film is somehow way more depressing and worse than Ant Man Quantumania. We honestly thought Eternals was bad, but that was only the beginning. It was only going to go downhill from there.Watching this movie felt like watching a beloved friend in a coma fighting for her life. It was sad, frustrating and ultimately hopeless. So much potential squandered right before our very eyes.Much has been said about the Girl Power aspect of this story, but it doesn't mean jack when the characters are so thinly written. After the big character tension build up between Carol and Monica, with the latter resenting her for not coming back, their fractures mend themselves very quickly. There is no chemistry between the the two at all.The villain is Bland with a capitol B, and highly forgettable.Nick Fury is actually pathetic in this movie. He doesn't at all act like the Fury we know and love. He was more in character in Far From Home when Talos was impersonating him!I don't think I've ever had this much of a bad experience with a film since Cats. And it is telling that there actually features a ludicrous scene involving baby flerkens and the song Memory.What the actual hell, Marvel?The only good thing is that it is mercifully short, and Iman Vellani does seem to be enjoying herself in the role.Once a great studio, brought crumbling down on itself. If I could give it zero stars, I would."
"Marvels","chenp-54708","10 November 2023",210,"Marvel movies really have fallen apart haven't they? This is definitely one of the worst Marvels movie I have seen out of all the Marvel movies I had watched. There really isn't too much to say about the movie because ""The Marvels"" is pretty much like almost every single Marvel movie but the writing, humor, direction, and performances are pretty much all over the place. Director Nia DaCosta has made ""Little Woods"" which I liked but her direction here is pretty bad and goes all over the place.The special effects are kind of rough on the edges, the actions and thrills were just okay and the performances, despite a pretty good cast, they aren't very good. Brie Larson is an actress I like but unfortunately her performance felt weak and lacking. The other performances as well including the child performances. The story isn't interesting as the writing is pretty bland and none of the characters were interesting. With a short runtime, the movie surprisingly was really boring.I do like superhero movies but it seems this one really just sucked. Overall, it's bad."
"Marvels","kevin_robbins","12 November 2023",310,"My wife and I recently caught Marvel's (2023) in theaters. The plot revolves around Captain Marvel's mistake in choosing sides during a battle, disrupting the cosmic balance. Two young ladies gain powers in the process, and Captain Marvel must collaborate with them to rectify her error and restore equilibrium to the universe.Directed by Nia DaCosta (Candyman) and featuring Brie Larson (Lessons in Chemistry), Teyonah Parris (Dear White People), Iman Vellani (Ms. Marvel), Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction), and Zawe Ashton (Blitz).This film boasts clean and classic Marvel-style characters, cinematography, action scenes, and special effects. However, the plot seems somewhat lackluster, with Captain Marvel possibly appearing more as a villain than a hero. The backstories of the heroes lack sufficient development, making it challenging to form a connection with them. The cat steals the show initially but feels overdone by the end, and even Samuel L. Jackson's wit falls short of expectations.In summary, this superhero movie prioritizes its message over a compelling storyline. While the characters and visuals are in line with Marvel's trademark style, the plot may leave audiences indifferent. The lack of character depth and an engaging storyline earns this film a 3/10, making it a skip-worthy experience."

The finale was perfect, and a beautiful ending to the show, while The Marvels is a complete mess. It's honestly given me whiplashThe Marvels is just an all-around bad movie. The script is awful and the story is super rushed and poorly executed, which both have an impact on how well the characters (and in-turn the actors) come-across on-screenThe action and humour are kind of alright, and the VFX are definitely better than anything we've seen in an MCU project since Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness (with the obvious exceptions of Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 and Loki Season 2), but that still doesn't exactly make it look greatThis movie is just painful to watch at points! Early on, it has some really fun moments, and felt like it could have actually been somewhat entertaining, but that feeling vanished as soon as it came. It's barley better than Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania, so you can do with that information what you will."
"Marvels","NanoFrog","16 January 2024",110,"So Stan Lee passes away and we get Disney now in full control of Marvel stories...and boy is there a difference. I could not finish watching this really bad film, it is just junk from scene to scene. The cast, I feel so sorry for them because the cast is a fine group for the most part...but the story, the effects, the directing are all jumbled up into a real mess. The premise is interesting but they have no idea what to do with it. I have never been a fan of Disney, maybe when I was 10 years old, back in the early 60s, but this is not at all Walt Disney. This is Disney INC and a massive number of talentless paperwork and book-keepers make their films these days. This is just junk slammed together by people who have no idea how to tell a story or stage intelligent effects. This film is not a Turkey, it is, in fact, just garbage. RIP MArvel."
"Marvels","OnlyAtJMart","12 November 2023",410,"Anyone who heard the news about this project knows that the production was a nightmare, and it shows in the final product here. It's like they couldn't figure out what direction to go, so they made 4 versions, and blended them together. Which would explain the high budget, the 5 delays, and the reshoots. Kamala's character was probably the best part of the movie. I promise you, the script did her no favors, but she stood out. Her acting was in line with her character. This was probably an exciting opportunity for her, and she wasn't going to let a bad script, and production problems stop her from giving a great effort. However, the story, the dialogue, the musical gimmick, the weak villain. It just didn't work. I don't think the blame lies solely with the actors, or even the director, who did lack the experience for helming a movie with a budget this size. I think Disney interfered heavily with the production, which almost always yields bad results. I think it was doomed to fail. They put so much pressure on this being successful, they forgot to make it coherent, unique, or interesting."
"Marvels","mildlyintrusive","13 November 2023",210,"Once in a while I tend to go to my local theater to check out something new, maybe a new release or a re-run of a movie. Today, I stumbled upon The Marvels, I thought ""Hey, I haven't been going to the theater this month that often, maybe I should try this out?"" And well, it seems that I'd made the wrong decision. The Marvels follows the titular Marvels trying to stop an evil Kree with one disadvantage however, every time they use their powers, it's Freaky Friday.Maybe its because of the very troubled production but everything just feels like an amalgamation of three separate movies, its like a ADHD experience. The movie does NOT take itself seriously at all, and as a result, it makes me hard to care for literally everything! Its like a circus act masquerading as a movie, it doesn't work! There were moments where characters were in danger and they start joking about it every opportunity they get. To add insult to injury was the treatment of the character of Nick Fury, who feels like a completely different character altogether, cracking lame after lame jokes every single time! Special effects were decent, but considering the massive 271M+ budget I wished they could've at least cared about the plot and flesh out some if the characters and their motivations instead of relying on action scene after action scene, it gets tiring after a while you know?Brie Larson herself looks tired and forced in this movie, her character also being this girl-boss who can sweep through enemies in this movie, no weaknesses and no vulnerabilities. It all feels so one-dimensional, it tries to be like a 80s action star with the likes of Arnold and co. But fails because they lack charisma and charm. Because of this I found it impossible to relate to her in any sense of way. Monica Rambeau wasn't trying her best here, and there is no opposing dynamic between the two to the point where I found her virtually indistinguishable from Mrs. Danvers herself. However I do commend Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan, whose child-like personality I was comfortable with and is the standout between the three leads but suffers from being very underwritten and the villain is a copy-and-paste from dozens we've seen before.Overall, a messy and disjointed movie with not much to offer rather than annoying, dreadful humor and some few flashy action scenes. It certainly feels like homework for the MCU as it struggles to keep a hook in something after the Infinity Saga. Skip this one and play with your action figures instead, Im sure it'll be better than this."
"Marvels","critic-97-417657","4 February 2024",810,"The movie was somewhat ridiculous, but I found myself giggling throughout it. It was actually quite fun. There were a lot of really charming things about this movie, and while the storyline lacked any real tension, I didn't really care. It was mostly about the character development, and the relationships between the three main characters. Overall, I just found it really fun and just didn't take it very seriously. In a lot of ways, it is a set up for the rest of the series, and is definitely not a standalone movie. And the post credit scene, amazing. Ties in a lot of potential for what they are going to be doing in this franchise."
"Marvels","The-Sarkologist","7 February 2024",710,"Well, I guess someone was right when they said that one of the big problems with this film was that you had to like watch 8 other films and 3 series to sort of understand what was going on. Mind you, I have actually done just that, but even then with the amount of time that had passed since I watched the other things it was still a little tricky understanding what was happening.Mind you, I did actually quite like the film. Like the scenes where they were switching places whenever they used their powers together, and also the big bad in the film, that was in part trying to save her people, but also attempting to punish Captain Marvel for what she had done to her people. Yeah, as it turned out, when she destroyed the great intelligence it sent the Kree into a massive civil war which basically destroyed their planet.So, if you had seen Miss Marvel, you will know that she has a thing for Captain Marvel, and of course it was always going to be a thing that she was eventually going to be involved in a team up. Also, there were some hints at the end that suggested that there was going to be another team-up film, though apparently that will still be some way off (and the problem will be that, no doubt, when they get around to it, all of them will be too old to be members of a possible Young Avengers - kids do grow up a little too fast).Yeah, I thought that this film was pretty good, though I have to agree that the problem is that you do need to catch up to speed to understand what is going on. Oh, it also seemed that it felt that it was a bit over the place, no doubt because they wanted to make the film shorter than a lot of the others. Still, it's good, especially if you are up to date on the films."
"Marvels","cherold","30 January 2024",710,"After the bad reviews, and considering how many bad superhero movies have come out lately, I would have skipped this one if the trailer didn't look like so much fun. Fortunately, the movie fulfills the trailer's promiseIn the movie, three superheroes with related powers find themselves suddenly swapping places with one another. The proves to be a good gimmick for both action and comedy, as the three keep finding themselves in one another's battles. Eventually, they master the situation in order to take down a very angry villain with an unusually sympathetic backstory.The movie leans heavily - and for the most part successfully - into the comedy. A big chunk of this is fueled by the teenage Captain Marvel fangirl Ms. Marvel, who is from a TV series I found too pre-teen-oriented to enjoy. Ms. Marvel's an annoying character but for the most part I found her amusing in this.There's also a funny gag with alien cats.While I enjoyed this movie, I have to admit its a bit of an unfocussed mess. There are a lot of elements just tossed in, like a whole thing with Marvel #3, Monica, dealing with her abandonment issues. These occasional ""emotional"" moments don't much interest me.Anyway, a lot of people hate this, but if you like the trailer, I'd say chance the movie (I did not take a chance on the last Aquaman movie because unlike The Marvels, the trailer looked just as bad as people said the movie was.Going against the current, I say if you want a bunch of comedy and some fun action then you should watch this one."
"Marvels","drawlife","8 November 2023",510,"THE MARVELS is here and it's a mashed up film that is totally all over the place. It feels as if this film was edited and chopped into pieces during post and it shows.Couple things I enjoyed, I did like seeing Carol Danvers and Monica Rambeau resolve and acknowledge their relationship, but due to the nature of their characters being straight arrows, it allows Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan to be the audience just as Tom Holland's Peter Parker was in CIVIL WAR. I did not particularly enjoy the MS. MARVEL series, but I can see her being the shoutout for many.I think the script just touched on the surface of Brie Larson's Captain Marvel herself, so diving into her more is a plus, however the story did her no favors once again and I did feel like she was given like four or five pieces of direction to portray her character compared to the more one-note performance in the first film. Teyonah Parris is commendable. She was the more science-y of the trio.Samuel L. Jackson just feels inconsistent especially after SECRET INVASION. Feels like this Nick Fury is a variant. He's simply passing through in this film.Another thing I liked was the incursions (also briefly touched on in DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS). We all complained about the lack of planting seeds for the future leading into KANG DYNASTY and SECRET WARS. Finally, this film it at least preps and teases what's to come down the line.The MCU's villain problem is a long known fact, but here it only cements their problem even further. Now I'm a fan of Lee Pace's over the top performance as Ronan, but Dar-Benn played by Zawe Ashton is literally a copy and paste of Ronan, but female. Nothing new about it. Definitely up there as one of the worst villains in the MCU.The power swaps were kinda cool so I can give it that. Nia DaCosta does a good job executing the fight scenes, but again as one should expect, VFX is meh. Now if you cringed during the musical note duel between the two Doctor Strange, then wait till you see one segment of the film where it feels like a misplaced musical. Lots of quirky and annoying humor like one should expect in an MCU film.The Skrulls are in the film and as a fan we always think we can write the better film after watching it, but I just DO NOT understand why this sequel couldn't have been SECRET INVASION(one of the worst MCU Disney+ shows). SECRET INVASION honestly should have been an Avengers film or at the very least a Captain Marvel sequel co-starring some Avengers, kinda like CIVIL WAR. I personally feel like that dilemma could have furthered Captain Marvel's development due to her involvement with them and how she's equally to blame for not helping them out when she and Fury promised to find them a home. But instead she's stuck with this material.The mid-credit scene is arguably the best part. Once again teasing things to come. It's stuff that like that, that will maybe still garner interest in the MCU despite its current fall from grace. The end-credit scene is alright. Not particularly jazzed about that promise down the line.On that note, the recent Variety article published about Marvel Studios talked about their behind the scenes trouble. It was said that Kevin Feige and his creative committee partook in their yearly Palm Springs retreat to regroup and refocus, so here's hoping to next year being more consistent with quality. Seemed like he was spread too thin with the mandate to have more quantity than quality.THE MARVELS is a season 1.5 for MS. MARVEL and a CAPTAIN MARVEL sequel that we never saw due to the flashbacks and exposition to explain things. And let's be clear, at this point everything feels like homework. That was going to be inevitable moving forward after INFINITY WAR and ENDGAMGE, but especially when Disney+ was announced making Kevin Feige spread out too thin. But it only feels like homework because everything that has been released is below the standard of what Marvel set up for us.So to sum it up, while I did find it slightly more appealing than the first CAPTAIN MARVEL and QUANTUMANIA, that isn't saying much. Low expectations definitely helped. Is THE MARVELS one of the worst? No, but it definitely belongs way down below the list.5/10."
"Marvels","tibby_23","17 January 2024",410,"By far the worst Marvel movie so far, I am extremely disappointed. After the mess that Thor 4 was, I was hoping that Marvel learned its lesson, but it seems not. I am honestly happy this movie did bad at the box office, that's what you get for ruining such a great character (I loved Cpt. Marvel from the comics).What makes it bad:
Action moves way too fast from one scene to anotherNo character improvement or growth by the end of the movieThings just happen with no storytellingNot serious enough, too childish for my tasteToo many goofy moments (singing, really? We've come this low, Marvel?)End scenes that try to set the context for next movies seem forced and unnecessaryI also found two good things eventually:
I liked the villain and her story, sympathized with her a bitAt least the movie was not long.These writers should never be hired again."
"Marvels","olcare","10 November 2023",410,"Criticizing specific parts of the movie became confusing for me as there were so many details I wanted to change. This film truly disappointed me, especially since my expectations were already low, and falling below them is a bad sign for Marvel. It had a Thor: Love and Thunder vibe, which I also disliked (4/10). I had been excited after watching Loki in the morning, but it was in vain.For me, the unbearable part was the music. After checking the playlists of movies I've watched for a long time, Marvel had by far the worst compositions. The music was exaggerated, drowning out the impact of fight scenes and making them unbearable. It was like overly noisy background music during a break.Another aspect I didn't like was the main villain. I can't believe Marvel fell into the same mistake again. The villain was poorly written, and Zawe Ashton's performance felt forced, appearing awkward in scenes. One major reason for this was the poor portrayal of the Kree Empire in the MCU. Neglecting the significance of the Kree made Supreme look bad. They could have explained the critical situation of the 'Hala' planet in the film's opening with a 30-35 minute sequence, providing context for the desperation of the Kree.Another thing I found absurd was Monica teleporting to a parallel universe. They portrayed the concept of parallel universes like child's play. Especially after watching Loki Season 2 in the morning, her randomly teleporting or getting stuck in another universe seemed too simplistic.Seeing Professor Beast was surprising and pleasing. The X-Men era is beginning, and despite the poor productions, I'm excited. Brie Larson was good again, carrying her character well. The scene with Monica, Kamala, Danvers vs Dar-Benn was good, thankfully without music. However, despite not being a fan of Kamala Khan, her origin is preserved, and it's not bad. But I feel there's a lack of harmony among our main three characters, and I believe it's a script issue, not an actor one.While I like the idea of saving a planet by traveling through different planets, I didn't like the execution at all. Presenting such a serious and contemporary issue as if it's the simplest thing with childlike music seems somewhat unserious to me.However it turns out, this film paved the way for others and served as a stepping stone. Hopefully, with Beast in Deadpool 3, the overall MCU storyline will improve, abandoning mediocrity urgently; otherwise, it will continue to receive poor ratings.Note: I forgot to mention in the review, but Goose is a fantastic character, and I hope we continue to see this adorable cat. The scene with all the cats was genuinely entertaining, one of the enjoyable moments in 4-5 scenes."
"Marvels","alensufli","8 November 2023",210,"Even writing a review is extremely pointless as we all knew what we were expecting months before but here I am. They even themselves admitted it. The film is a huge disappointment. The plot is all over the place. Actions sequences were sometimes good but sometime were so dumb I didn't know where to look, where to pay attention. I like how they tried to catch the old marvel magic. Yes. They tried. But they utterly failed. Feige pulled off ""wait until the post credit scene to get excited cuz the film itself is boring"" trick again. And it wasn't a ""wow"" for me at least. The theatre was silent throughout and after the film. No one even made a giggling sound. Dead silence. Jokes were landing facedown to the ground every time a character made one. That's right. Every character there is comic relief. And I absolutely don't wanna talk about acting."

Confusing.I had hoped that following Guardians 3 it could've get much worse for the Marvel universe, at least Guardians has Rocket😂It's hard to find any plot to this movie. Carol Danvers (Captain Marvel) does throw a lot of people through the roof but the plot is a quantum entanglement mess. The movie is blissfully short but feels longer as it's so bad and some people walked out of the theatre. I was so pleasantly when it ended.I think it's about to retire the whole Marvel superhero franchise as this phase is going badly."
"Marvels","nscoby93","10 November 2023",210,"I actually had no intention of watching this film in theaters. Originally, I was just going to wait for its home release on Disney Plus, but after recently rewatching WandaVision, I genuinely wanted to see how they would handle Monica Rambeau and see what they would do with her.So I'll mention the positives for this film first...The movie is actually pretty, I really enjoyed the film aesthetically it looked good. This is very surprising to say as recent Marvel projects are tremendous eye sores.The films central characters, Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) and Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani), were surprisingly good. I had fully anticipated to dislike Captain Marvel and Ms Marvel in this film but I surprisingly enjoyed them both which is a big compliment coming from me, and Monica Rambeau is my favorite of the three she was good as I expected and anticipated. All three actresses gave enjoyable performances, and they all worked well together on screen.Then, of course, Samuel Jackson is always great! And the return of everyone's favorite Flerken kitty Goose. She had a great sequence that I refuse to spoil, but it had me dying. Goose saved this film!And well that's it...This film is just bad. Bad writing, bad pacing, bad storytelling. Nothing in this film is properly set up as it rushes through its 1 hour and 45 minute run time. Which is quite frankly fine for me as I genuinely did not want more of this.This movie as a whole is just overwhelmingly safe. It has no stakes, takes no risks, and does nothing. But there is actual enjoyment in its failings. It was so bad that it was good. The amount of eye rolling, face palms, and sighs I gave through this film was astonishing. I gave up on this film within the first 30 minutes, and afterward, that's when the enjoyment began because of how bad it went on to be.Then suddenly, out of nowhere, the film became a musical? Like what is happening? This film is so chaotic and unstructured. It just never stopped.The film had a good mid-credit scene so you know stay for that. Unfortunately, it was spoiled for me, so it didn't hit as hard as it could have. Especially if you're a fan of the actor who originally played the character the scene introduces.But The Marvels was exactly what I anticipated it to be, a below average dump. Which is a shame because they play with some interesting concepts in this film, but they do nothing with them, or they are just poorly handled. I can at least say I didn't hate this movie. Unfortunately, I just enjoyed it for all the wrong reasons.IMDb: 3/10

"Marvels","brentsbulletinboard","11 November 2023",510,"When I first heard the title of this movie, I thought it was about a 1960s girls' singing group. And, frankly, that would have probably made for a better movie. Writer-director Nia DaCosta's third feature outing and the latest in the Marvel Universe paradigm is a wildly inconsistent superhero movie that tries too hard to do too much and doesn't have a script to support it. Too many of its plot elements aren't adequately explained until well into the story, while others aren't explained at all, leaving viewers who aren't comic book laureates wondering what's going on (particularly at film's end). Meanwhile, other narrative aspects frequently appear gimmicky and grow old quickly, such as the introduction of the primary superpower that its three protagonists share, one that almost becomes slapstickish after an all-too-brief while. On top of that, the CGI effects vacillate from one end of the quality spectrum to the other, creating a mix of images that are either startling to look at or stunningly cheesy at best. Add to that a villain that isn't particularly menacing, along with attempts at humor that either succeed brilliantly (cat lovers take note) or fall flat and look incredibly lame (as aficionados of musical theater will undoubtedly attest), all of which further add to the picture's pervasive inconsistency. The inclusion of ample clues for advancing the overarching Marvel Universe storyline continues here, too, furthering a trend that's growing tiresome in the studio's releases, a development akin to the ""Paul is dead"" legacy come to life with every passing picture. Then there's the trio of heroes themselves, who often appear more like they've been plucked from a giddy slumber party flick or a Cyndi Lauper video than taking center stage as seriously empowered champions in an action-adventure offering. All of these failings combine to make this production more of a forgettable placeholder in the Marvel mythology than a standalone feature (not to mention a pale substitute for a sequel to the far-superior film that launched the Captain Marvel franchise in 2019). In short, ""The Marvels"" is as much of a mess as it is a movie, and that's troubling for several reasons. It lends credence to the growing criticism that films like this aren't to be taken seriously. It reinforces the notion that they're cookie-cutter in nature, easily interchangeable with one another. And it raises questions about the career choices of lead actress Brie Larson, who, though quite capable of playing roles like these, is running the risk of becoming type-cast, a troubling prospect for an Academy Award-winning actress who possesses a depth of talent and is handily adept at taking on better and more serious material than this. In the wake of this release, Marvel Studios should take a step back and seriously assess where its future is headed, especially if movies like this are any indication. As pictures like ""Wakanda Forever"" (2022) show, the studio is capable of better work - and it's time to show viewers that."
"Marvels","Sleepin_Dragon","10 November 2023",410,"Carol Danvers is attempting to save the universe, but her incredible powers become entangled with those of Kamala Khan and Monica Rambeau, they must unite to save the world.Ouch, what can you say, this is surely one of Marvel's lowest points, I honestly don't know who the target audience is, or who this is going to appeal to, young teens only maybe? Anyhow, this was an absolute mess.The writing was clearly problematic, it doesn't gel, it is genuinely all over the place. I do very much wonder if huge sections of this film cut? It can be the only answer, it just doesn't flow at all, and that short run time...Special effects, some were pretty good, some were poor, I just wish there was a greater focus on plot, it just seemed like 100 minutes of CGI, noise and random events.Brie Larson, I'm not sure about you, but to me she looked totally disinterested and bored by the whole thing, what I didn't see, was someone committed to the role. I thought Samuel Jackson was rather good, but again poorly served by the script.It didn't look great from the trailers, and in reality, it's another clunker from Marvel Studios.4/10."
"Marvels","judywalker2","14 December 2023",510,"Went to see this movie with my 17- and 11-year-old granddaughters. One is a Ms. Marvel fan and the other is now.

I also loved Wanda Vision and the introduction of Monica Rambeau and I was hoping for at least a good continuation of her story. I didn't watch Ms. Marvel because I'm not a teen and I knew it wasn't for me; and after watching her parts in this movie I'm glad I stuck to that.All three actresses are good and of course Samuel L in always a pleasure to see, but none of the other characters including the so-called villain were the least bit interesting. Most of the scenes were just downright silly. I hope they continue Monica's story with better writing and I wish Marvel would stop being silly and go back to making movies for adults and kids."
"Marvels","isaacsundaralingam","11 November 2023",310,"The MCU has absolutely overstayed its welcome. Post Avengers Endgame, these projects have been feeling more and more like content than cinema (except the rare surprises like GOTG 3). Superhero fatigue, they call it and this movie does practically nothing but to amp it up to 11.You watch the trailer, you know what happens. You bet on originality, you end up homeless. There's nothing new for me to say that I haven't already said about any of the other MCU content as of late. It's so generic that I'm confident a year from now, no one would remember this movie even existed. With every new MCU project, the jokes-per-minute ratio keeps getting worse, the villains are a writer's version of a stock photograph (I can't even remember the villain's name in this movie and it hasn't even been a day since I watched it), the CGI is so out there you can almost see the CGI artists' tears on screen, and it's getting more and more difficult to tell each MCU project apart cos they're all just the same.The only few positives I can identify here are actresses Iman Vellani and Brie Larson (Larson, who seems much more relaxed and settled into her superhero boots), and maybe the flashy action sequences. Otherwise, there's nothing here to watch, nothing here to experience and nothing here to enjoy. What a shame."
"Marvels","MrDHWong","9 November 2023",410,"""The Marvels"" is the sequel to 2019's ""Captain Marvel"", a continuation of the Disney+ series ""Ms. Marvel"", and the 33rd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris, and Iman Vellani, it represents a painful look at the downward spiral the MCU has found itself caught in since the end of Phase 3.Sometime after the events of ""Captain Marvel"", Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) has unintentionally started a civil war among the alien race known as the Kree. The leader of the Kree, Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton), soon finds one half of the Quantum Bands and later seeks out the other half, which is in the possession of Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel (Iman Vellani). At the request of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Carol teams up with Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) to negotiate peace among the Kree, but as the two investigate a wormhole in outer space, Monica, Carol, and Kamala start mysteriously switching powers with one another. Realising something is amiss, the trio are forced to work together to figure out what is causing this strange phenomena and hopefully put a stop to both Dar-Benn and the warring Kree.It's becoming harder and harder to call myself fan of the MCU, given the array of serviceable to terrible projects they have been churning out lately. To be fair though, it is a tall order to top something as ambitious as the culmination of over ten years worth of universe building after both ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and ""Avengers: Endgame"" pulled it off so effectively years ago. For the longest time, I have been willing to defend the post-Endgame MCU for trying different things, as I was under the impression that all of this would be leading to exciting new projects on the horizon. However, after sitting through ""The Marvels"", I can say with a hint of heartbreak that practically all of my optimism for the MCU's future has all but disappeared, as it contains next to nothing worth defending from a creative standpoint.Perhaps the best way to describe my viewing experience with this film would be ""apathetic"", because at no point does it ever feel like anything important is at stake. This is mainly due to either our three heroes being too overpowered or there not being enough information provided about the ones who need saving. Whenever a horde of enemies are swarming the trio, we watch as the three of them effortlessly take them out without even breaking a sweat. Action-packed moments like these that once elicited excitement have now been reduced to a series of bland fistfights and generic CGI blasts that have all been done before in better MCU films.We see Carol Danvers quickly blast everyone away with her energy beams and block punches with her hands, never once showing any signs that she is in real danger. Her accomplice Monica Rambeau does pretty much the same thing, only with less time on screen. Even Kamala Khan, who is the biggest fish-out-of-water in this situation, has no major trouble dealing with foes coming at her from every angle, always using her half of the Quantum Band to her advantage. How is it possible to keep the audience on their toes if the enemy forces are so inefficient that even an inexperienced child can wipe the floor with them this easily? On that note, it also doesn't help that none of these three heroes appear to have any physical weaknesses or personal insecurities holding them back, which causes all of the tension to evaporate instantly.In addition to this, we are barely shown anything interesting about the Kree that will keep the audience invested in their role in the story. As far as the film is concerned, they are nothing more than a stock species of extraterrestrials that are causing problems simply because the plot demands it. The original ""Captain Marvel"" film established that the Kree were the ones who inadvertently gave Carol her powers and took her in among them. Yet, this film never reminds the audience of that, instead opting to throw them right into the thick of the conflict without any important context. As a result, I just did not care at all about what happened to any of these people.It's also worth mentioning that this film is rife with obvious re-edits and tonal inconsistencies. One scene where this is most evident is where Carol Danvers is opening up to both Rambeau and Khan about her relationship with the Kree. What could have been a good method of showcasing Danvers's humanity is instead brushed aside for something completely unrelated after less than two minutes. I couldn't help but assume that this scene was supposed to go on much longer but was cut in post production for whatever reason. To add insult to injury, the scene is then immediately followed by a strange attempt at comic relief which fails to raise even a single laugh. Although Marvel films are known for their blending of comedy with drama, a moment like this felt like a rather tacky addition to the film that only hampers the already poor narrative structure. Worse still, there are other similar occurrences like this throughout the rest of the story.One of the biggest problems with the original ""Captain Marvel"" film was how weakly written the title character was, with her lack of likeable character traits and overly serious demeanour being a major reason why she is not viewed favourably by fans. You'd expect the filmmakers to remedy this problem for the sequel, but you would be wrong. I'm not sure whether it's Brie Larson's underwhelming performance or just plain old bad writing but I have never once felt any fondness for Carol Danvers as a person. As mentioned above, she efficiently fights her way through many bad guys with no issue whatsoever, never once showing any emotional weakness or other potential vulnerabilities. Because of this, Carol Danvers never feels like a real person, being nothing more than a one-dimensional superhero that is practically impossible for anybody to identify with. Her character has not changed or grown since the first film, and it looks like she won't be doing so anytime soon.I keep trying to remind myself of Monica Rambeau's contribution to the story but nothing memorable ever comes to mind without doing some kind of online research. Like Brie Larson, there is nothing especially remarkable about Teyonah Parris's performance, as her character is as bland as she comes. Though it is established that Rambeau looked up to Carol Danvers as a child, her role in this story is nothing more than playing second fiddle to an already dull lead protagonist. Yes, Rambeau is very strong and yes, she is more than capable of taking care of herself in a fight, but beyond that what else does she offer? Most of the time she just goes along with Danvers's orders without ever questioning her or giving her personal opinions, making her nothing more than a blind follower. I was hoping to have seen some kind of opposing dynamic between Danvers and Rambeau, as that would have given their characters an important amount of depth the distinguish the two from one another. No such luck I'm afraid.The only character I sort of cared about was Kamala Khan, whose childlike naiveté made her the most relatable of the three leads. In her feature film debut, Iman Vellani does carry over many of Khan's human traits from the Disney+ series ""Ms. Marvel"", being that she's still young and coming to terms with mastering her powers. Unfortunately, she does not achieve this through the character herself, but rather due to how woefully underwritten her two co-stars are in comparison. I wanted to see the three as kindred spirits, fighting as trio but standing out as individuals. Instead, all we get are two dull, stoic, overpowered adults and a young kid working together for no other reason than because the writers said so.As depressing as it sounds, the once mighty MCU is showing no signs of improvement as ""The Marvels"" just may be the worst film in the series so far. There simply isn't enough reason to justify its existence outside of some kind of contractual obligation by the higher ups at Disney, and I fully respect many people's decision to skip it altogether. At this point, I seriously doubt the MCU can ever return to its former glory, as this film is set to become the series' biggest box office bomb to date. I can only hope in vain that Disney will learn an important lesson from this film's failure, but knowing their track record that seems unlikely.I rate it 4/10."

"Marvels","ThereelscoopwithKK","10 November 2023",110,"This second installment makes the original Captain Marvel look like a cinematic masterpiece... Nothing about this movie works. Although Brie Larson's acting has improved over the years it feels like she doesn't want to be there for this at all. Further, when you break it down, there is really no story at all happening. In fact, the solution to the entire problem is so extremely simple and solvable that you really wonder why there was a conflict in the first place. So much of everything is unexplained and eventually you stop trying to figure it out because you eventually lose all interest . Samuel L Jackson's character , Nick Fury, is hardly even a shell of his former self and is essentially now demoted to comedic relief.The scenes don't really mesh together at all. None of them are really necessary to advancing a plot and all feature the same repeated choreographic battle. The villain lacks any real charisma and is only provided a very brief backstory. Overall she never feels like too much of a threat.There's one part in particular that I think is absolutely a candidate for worst sequence of 2023. Without spoiling it , it is essentially a planet that looks like a cheap rip off of the Wizard of Oz. It just captures all of the problems with this movie into one scene. There's been a lot of less than stellar work from Marvel since endgame, but this is reaching new depths.I'm not even going to get started on the cats scene with the theme song....Please Loki, reset the entire timeline."

So much potential squandered right before our very eyes.Much has been said about the Girl Power aspect of this story, but it doesn't mean jack when the characters are so thinly written. After the big character tension build up between Carol and Monica, with the latter resenting her for not coming back, their fractures mend themselves very quickly. There is no chemistry between the the two at all.The villain is Bland with a capitol B, and highly forgettable.Nick Fury is actually pathetic in this movie. He doesn't at all act like the Fury we know and love. He was more in character in Far From Home when Talos was impersonating him!I don't think I've ever had this much of a bad experience with a film since Cats. And it is telling that there actually features a ludicrous scene involving baby flerkens and the song Memory.What the actual hell, Marvel?The only good thing is that it is mercifully short, and Iman Vellani does seem to be enjoying herself in the role.Once a great studio, brought crumbling down on itself.

Director Nia DaCosta has made ""Little Woods"" which I liked but her direction here is pretty bad and goes all over the place.The special effects are kind of rough on the edges, the actions and thrills were just okay and the performances, despite a pretty good cast, they aren't very good. Brie Larson is an actress I like but unfortunately her performance felt weak and lacking. The other performances as well including the child performances.

"Marvels","kevin_robbins","12 November 2023",310,"My wife and I recently caught Marvel's (2023) in theaters. The plot revolves around Captain Marvel's mistake in choosing sides during a battle, disrupting the cosmic balance. Two young ladies gain powers in the process, and Captain Marvel must collaborate with them to rectify her error and restore equilibrium to the universe.Directed by Nia DaCosta (Candyman) and featuring Brie Larson (Lessons in Chemistry), Teyonah Parris (Dear White People), Iman Vellani (Ms. Marvel), Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction), and Zawe Ashton (Blitz).This film boasts clean and classic Marvel-style characters, cinematography, action scenes, and special effects. However, the plot seems somewhat lackluster, with Captain Marvel possibly appearing more as a villain than a hero. The backstories of the heroes lack sufficient development, making it challenging to form a connection with them. The cat steals the show initially but feels overdone by the end, and even Samuel L. Jackson's wit falls short of expectations.In summary, this superhero movie prioritizes its message over a compelling storyline. While the characters and visuals are in line with Marvel's trademark style, the plot may leave audiences indifferent. The lack of character depth and an engaging storyline earns this film a 3/10, making it a skip-worthy experience."

The cast, I feel so sorry for them because the cast is a fine group for the most part...but the story, the effects, the directing are all jumbled up into a real mess. The premise is interesting but they have no idea what to do with it. I have never been a fan of Disney, maybe when I was 10 years old, back in the early 60s, but this is not at all Walt Disney. This is Disney INC and a massive number of talentless paperwork and book-keepers make their films these days. This is just junk slammed together by people who have no idea how to tell a story or stage intelligent effects. This film is not a Turkey, it is, in fact, just garbage. RIP MArvel."
"Marvels","OnlyAtJMart","12 November 2023",410,"Anyone who heard the news about this project knows that the production was a nightmare, and it shows in the final product here. It's like they couldn't figure out what direction to go, so they made 4 versions, and blended them together. Which would explain the high budget, the 5 delays, and the reshoots. Kamala's character was probably the best part of the movie. I promise you, the script did her no favors, but she stood out. Her acting was in line with her character. This was probably an exciting opportunity for her, and she wasn't going to let a bad script, and production problems stop her from giving a great effort. However, the story, the dialogue, the musical gimmick, the weak villain. It just didn't work. I don't think the blame lies solely with the actors, or even the director, who did lack the experience for helming a movie with a budget this size. I think Disney interfered heavily with the production, which almost always yields bad results. I think it was doomed to fail. They put so much pressure on this being successful, they forgot to make it coherent, unique, or interesting."
"Marvels","mildlyintrusive","13 November 2023",210,"Once in a while I tend to go to my local theater to check out something new, maybe a new release or a re-run of a movie. Today, I stumbled upon The Marvels, I thought ""Hey, I haven't been going to the theater this month that often, maybe I should try this out?"" And well, it seems that I'd made the wrong decision. The Marvels follows the titular Marvels trying to stop an evil Kree with one disadvantage however, every time they use their powers, it's Freaky Friday.Maybe its because of the very troubled production but everything just feels like an amalgamation of three separate movies, its like a ADHD experience. The movie does NOT take itself seriously at all, and as a result, it makes me hard to care for literally everything! Its like a circus act masquerading as a movie, it doesn't work! There were moments where characters were in danger and they start joking about it every opportunity they get. To add insult to injury was the treatment of the character of Nick Fury, who feels like a completely different character altogether, cracking lame after lame jokes every single time! Special effects were decent, but considering the massive 271M+ budget I wished they could've at least cared about the plot and flesh out some if the characters and their motivations instead of relying on action scene after action scene, it gets tiring after a while you know?Brie Larson herself looks tired and forced in this movie, her character also being this girl-boss who can sweep through enemies in this movie, no weaknesses and no vulnerabilities. It all feels so one-dimensional, it tries to be like a 80s action star with the likes of Arnold and co. But fails because they lack charisma and charm. Because of this I found it impossible to relate to her in any sense of way. Monica Rambeau wasn't trying her best here, and there is no opposing dynamic between the two to the point where I found her virtually indistinguishable from Mrs. Danvers herself. However I do commend Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan, whose child-like personality I was comfortable with and is the standout between the three leads but suffers from being very underwritten and the villain is a copy-and-paste from dozens we've seen before.Overall, a messy and disjointed movie with not much to offer rather than annoying, dreadful humor and some few flashy action scenes. It certainly feels like homework for the MCU as it struggles to keep a hook in something after the Infinity Saga. Skip this one and play with your action figures instead, Im sure it'll be better than this."
"Marvels","critic-97-417657","4 February 2024",810,"The movie was somewhat ridiculous, but I found myself giggling throughout it. It was actually quite fun. There were a lot of really charming things about this movie, and while the storyline lacked any real tension, I didn't really care. It was mostly about the character development, and the relationships between the three main characters. Overall, I just found it really fun and just didn't take it very seriously. In a lot of ways, it is a set up for the rest of the series, and is definitely not a standalone movie. And the post credit scene, amazing. Ties in a lot of potential for what they are going to be doing in this franchise."
"Marvels","The-Sarkologist","7 February 2024",710,"Well, I guess someone was right when they said that one of the big problems with this film was that you had to like watch 8 other films and 3 series to sort of understand what was going on. Mind you, I have actually done just that, but even then with the amount of time that had passed since I watched the other things it was still a little tricky understanding what was happening.Mind you, I did actually quite like the film. Like the scenes where they were switching places whenever they used their powers together, and also the big bad in the film, that was in part trying to save her people, but also attempting to punish Captain Marvel for what she had done to her people. Yeah, as it turned out, when she destroyed the great intelligence it sent the Kree into a massive civil war which basically destroyed their planet.So, if you had seen Miss Marvel, you will know that she has a thing for Captain Marvel, and of course it was always going to be a thing that she was eventually going to be involved in a team up. Also, there were some hints at the end that suggested that there was going to be another team-up film, though apparently that will still be some way off (and the problem will be that, no doubt, when they get around to it, all of them will be too old to be members of a possible Young Avengers - kids do grow up a little too fast).Yeah, I thought that this film was pretty good, though I have to agree that the problem is that you do need to catch up to speed to understand what is going on. Oh, it also seemed that it felt that it was a bit over the place, no doubt because they wanted to make the film shorter than a lot of the others. Still, it's good, especially if you are up to date on the films."
"Marvels","cherold","30 January 2024",710,"After the bad reviews, and considering how many bad superhero movies have come out lately, I would have skipped this one if the trailer didn't look like so much fun. Fortunately, the movie fulfills the trailer's promiseIn the movie, three superheroes with related powers find themselves suddenly swapping places with one another. The proves to be a good gimmick for both action and comedy, as the three keep finding themselves in one another's battles. Eventually, they master the situation in order to take down a very angry villain with an unusually sympathetic backstory.The movie leans heavily - and for the most part successfully - into the comedy. A big chunk of this is fueled by the teenage Captain Marvel fangirl Ms. Marvel, who is from a TV series I found too pre-teen-oriented to enjoy. Ms. Marvel's an annoying character but for the most part I found her amusing in this.There's also a funny gag with alien cats.While I enjoyed this movie, I have to admit its a bit of an unfocussed mess. There are a lot of elements just tossed in, like a whole thing with Marvel #3, Monica, dealing with her abandonment issues. These occasional ""emotional"" moments don't much interest me.Anyway, a lot of people hate this, but if you like the trailer, I'd say chance the movie (I did not take a chance on the last Aquaman movie because unlike The Marvels, the trailer looked just as bad as people said the movie was.Going against the current, I say if you want a bunch of comedy and some fun action then you should watch this one."
"Marvels","drawlife","8 November 2023",510,"THE MARVELS is here and it's a mashed up film that is totally all over the place. It feels as if this film was edited and chopped into pieces during post and it shows.Couple things I enjoyed, I did like seeing Carol Danvers and Monica Rambeau resolve and acknowledge their relationship, but due to the nature of their characters being straight arrows, it allows Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan to be the audience just as Tom Holland's Peter Parker was in CIVIL WAR. I did not particularly enjoy the MS. MARVEL series, but I can see her being the shoutout for many.I think the script just touched on the surface of Brie Larson's Captain Marvel herself, so diving into her more is a plus, however the story did her no favors once again and I did feel like she was given like four or five pieces of direction to portray her character compared to the more one-note performance in the first film. Teyonah Parris is commendable. She was the more science-y of the trio.Samuel L. Jackson just feels inconsistent especially after SECRET INVASION. Feels like this Nick Fury is a variant. He's simply passing through in this film.Another thing I liked was the incursions (also briefly touched on in DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS). We all complained about the lack of planting seeds for the future leading into KANG DYNASTY and SECRET WARS. Finally, this film it at least preps and teases what's to come down the line.The MCU's villain problem is a long known fact, but here it only cements their problem even further. Now I'm a fan of Lee Pace's over the top performance as Ronan, but Dar-Benn played by Zawe Ashton is literally a copy and paste of Ronan, but female. Nothing new about it. Definitely up there as one of the worst villains in the MCU.The power swaps were kinda cool so I can give it that. Nia DaCosta does a good job executing the fight scenes, but again as one should expect, VFX is meh. Now if you cringed during the musical note duel between the two Doctor Strange, then wait till you see one segment of the film where it feels like a misplaced musical. Lots of quirky and annoying humor like one should expect in an MCU film.The Skrulls are in the film and as a fan we always think we can write the better film after watching it, but I just DO NOT understand why this sequel couldn't have been SECRET INVASION(one of the worst MCU Disney+ shows). SECRET INVASION honestly should have been an Avengers film or at the very least a Captain Marvel sequel co-starring some Avengers, kinda like CIVIL WAR. I personally feel like that dilemma could have furthered Captain Marvel's development due to her involvement with them and how she's equally to blame for not helping them out when she and Fury promised to find them a home. But instead she's stuck with this material.The mid-credit scene is arguably the best part. Once again teasing things to come. It's stuff that like that, that will maybe still garner interest in the MCU despite its current fall from grace. The end-credit scene is alright. Not particularly jazzed about that promise down the line.On that note, the recent Variety article published about Marvel Studios talked about their behind the scenes trouble. It was said that Kevin Feige and his creative committee partook in their yearly Palm Springs retreat to regroup and refocus, so here's hoping to next year being more consistent with quality. Seemed like he was spread too thin with the mandate to have more quantity than quality.THE MARVELS is a season 1.5 for MS. MARVEL and a CAPTAIN MARVEL sequel that we never saw due to the flashbacks and exposition to explain things. And let's be clear, at this point everything feels like homework. That was going to be inevitable moving forward after INFINITY WAR and ENDGAMGE, but especially when Disney+ was announced making Kevin Feige spread out too thin. But it only feels like homework because everything that has been released is below the standard of what Marvel set up for us.So to sum it up, while I did find it slightly more appealing than the first CAPTAIN MARVEL and QUANTUMANIA, that isn't saying much. Low expectations definitely helped. Is THE MARVELS one of the worst? No, but it definitely belongs way down below the list.5/10."
"Marvels","tibby_23","17 January 2024",410,"By far the worst Marvel movie so far, I am extremely disappointed. After the mess that Thor 4 was, I was hoping that Marvel learned its lesson, but it seems not. I am honestly happy this movie did bad at the box office, that's what you get for ruining such a great character (I loved Cpt. Marvel from the comics).What makes it bad:
Action moves way too fast from one scene to anotherNo character improvement or growth by the end of the movieThings just happen with no storytellingNot serious enough, too childish for my tasteToo many goofy moments (singing, really? We've come this low, Marvel?)End scenes that try to set the context for next movies seem forced and unnecessaryI also found two good things eventually:
I liked the villain and her story, sympathized with her a bitAt least the movie was not long.These writers should never be hired again."
"Marvels","olcare","10 November 2023",410,"Criticizing specific parts of the movie became confusing for me as there were so many details I wanted to change. This film truly disappointed me, especially since my expectations were already low, and falling below them is a bad sign for Marvel. It had a Thor: Love and Thunder vibe, which I also disliked (4/10). I had been excited after watching Loki in the morning, but it was in vain.For me, the unbearable part was the music. After checking the playlists of movies I've watched for a long time, Marvel had by far the worst compositions. The music was exaggerated, drowning out the impact of fight scenes and making them unbearable. It was like overly noisy background music during a break.Another aspect I didn't like was the main villain. I can't believe Marvel fell into the same mistake again. The villain was poorly written, and Zawe Ashton's performance felt forced, appearing awkward in scenes. One major reason for this was the poor portrayal of the Kree Empire in the MCU. Neglecting the significance of the Kree made Supreme look bad. They could have explained the critical situation of the 'Hala' planet in the film's opening with a 30-35 minute sequence, providing context for the desperation of the Kree.Another thing I found absurd was Monica teleporting to a parallel universe. They portrayed the concept of parallel universes like child's play. Especially after watching Loki Season 2 in the morning, her randomly teleporting or getting stuck in another universe seemed too simplistic.Seeing Professor Beast was surprising and pleasing. The X-Men era is beginning, and despite the poor productions, I'm excited. Brie Larson was good again, carrying her character well. The scene with Monica, Kamala, Danvers vs Dar-Benn was good, thankfully without music. However, despite not being a fan of Kamala Khan, her origin is preserved, and it's not bad. But I feel there's a lack of harmony among our main three characters, and I believe it's a script issue, not an actor one.While I like the idea of saving a planet by traveling through different planets, I didn't like the execution at all. Presenting such a serious and contemporary issue as if it's the simplest thing with childlike music seems somewhat unserious to me.However it turns out, this film paved the way for others and served as a stepping stone. Hopefully, with Beast in Deadpool 3, the overall MCU storyline will improve, abandoning mediocrity urgently; otherwise, it will continue to receive poor ratings.Note: I forgot to mention in the review, but Goose is a fantastic character, and I hope we continue to see this adorable cat. The scene with all the cats was genuinely entertaining, one of the enjoyable moments in 4-5 scenes."
"Marvels","alensufli","8 November 2023",210,"Even writing a review is extremely pointless as we all knew what we were expecting months before but here I am. They even themselves admitted it. The film is a huge disappointment. The plot is all over the place. Actions sequences were sometimes good but sometime were so dumb I didn't know where to look, where to pay attention. I like how they tried to catch the old marvel magic. Yes. They tried. But they utterly failed. Feige pulled off ""wait until the post credit scene to get excited cuz the film itself is boring"" trick again. And it wasn't a ""wow"" for me at least. The theatre was silent throughout and after the film. No one even made a giggling sound. Dead silence. Jokes were landing facedown to the ground every time a character made one. That's right. Every character there is comic relief. And I absolutely don't wanna talk about acting."
"Marvels","S3pt3m63r","18 November 2023",NA,"Unfortunately if you haven't got Disney plus and you don't keep to speed with the tv series, then you this movie won't make much sense as it relies on you knowing what's going on in that universe so far, which I'm not up to date with and involves the Miss Marvels characters which haven't been introduced in the movies. Confusing.I had hoped that following Guardians 3 it could've get much worse for the Marvel universe, at least Guardians has Rocket😂It's hard to find any plot to this movie. Carol Danvers (Captain Marvel) does throw a lot of people through the roof but the plot is a quantum entanglement mess. The movie is blissfully short but feels longer as it's so bad and some people walked out of the theatre. I was so pleasantly when it ended.I think it's about to retire the whole Marvel superhero franchise as this phase is going badly."
"Marvels","nscoby93","10 November 2023",210,"I actually had no intention of watching this film in theaters. Originally, I was just going to wait for its home release on Disney Plus, but after recently rewatching WandaVision, I genuinely wanted to see how they would handle Monica Rambeau and see what they would do with her.So I'll mention the positives for this film first...The movie is actually pretty, I really enjoyed the film aesthetically it looked good. This is very surprising to say as recent Marvel projects are tremendous eye sores.The films central characters, Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) and Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani), were surprisingly good. I had fully anticipated to dislike Captain Marvel and Ms Marvel in this film but I surprisingly enjoyed them both which is a big compliment coming from me, and Monica Rambeau is my favorite of the three she was good as I expected and anticipated. All three actresses gave enjoyable performances, and they all worked well together on screen.Then, of course, Samuel Jackson is always great! And the return of everyone's favorite Flerken kitty Goose. She had a great sequence that I refuse to spoil, but it had me dying. Goose saved this film!And well that's it...This film is just bad. Bad writing, bad pacing, bad storytelling. Nothing in this film is properly set up as it rushes through its 1 hour and 45 minute run time. Which is quite frankly fine for me as I genuinely did not want more of this.This movie as a whole is just overwhelmingly safe. It has no stakes, takes no risks, and does nothing. But there is actual enjoyment in its failings. It was so bad that it was good. The amount of eye rolling, face palms, and sighs I gave through this film was astonishing. I gave up on this film within the first 30 minutes, and afterward, that's when the enjoyment began because of how bad it went on to be.Then suddenly, out of nowhere, the film became a musical? Like what is happening? This film is so chaotic and unstructured. It just never stopped.The film had a good mid-credit scene so you know stay for that. Unfortunately, it was spoiled for me, so it didn't hit as hard as it could have. Especially if you're a fan of the actor who originally played the character the scene introduces.But The Marvels was exactly what I anticipated it to be, a below average dump. Which is a shame because they play with some interesting concepts in this film, but they do nothing with them, or they are just poorly handled. I can at least say I didn't hate this movie. Unfortunately, I just enjoyed it for all the wrong reasons.IMDb: 3/10

Once you get over its not adding anything or revealing any easter eggs, you can enjoy it for what it is.All three main characters deliver on their role, and it improves on captain marvels solo outing. Sit down take any preconceived ideas you have, remove any anticipation of easter eggs and enjoy it for what it is.Has marvel lost its way, yes.

"Marvels","brentsbulletinboard","11 November 2023",510,"When I first heard the title of this movie, I thought it was about a 1960s girls' singing group. And, frankly, that would have probably made for a better movie. Writer-director Nia DaCosta's third feature outing and the latest in the Marvel Universe paradigm is a wildly inconsistent superhero movie that tries too hard to do too much and doesn't have a script to support it. Too many of its plot elements aren't adequately explained until well into the story, while others aren't explained at all, leaving viewers who aren't comic book laureates wondering what's going on (particularly at film's end). Meanwhile, other narrative aspects frequently appear gimmicky and grow old quickly, such as the introduction of the primary superpower that its three protagonists share, one that almost becomes slapstickish after an all-too-brief while. On top of that, the CGI effects vacillate from one end of the quality spectrum to the other, creating a mix of images that are either startling to look at or stunningly cheesy at best. Add to that a villain that isn't particularly menacing, along with attempts at humor that either succeed brilliantly (cat lovers take note) or fall flat and look incredibly lame (as aficionados of musical theater will undoubtedly attest), all of which further add to the picture's pervasive inconsistency. The inclusion of ample clues for advancing the overarching Marvel Universe storyline continues here, too, furthering a trend that's growing tiresome in the studio's releases, a development akin to the ""Paul is dead"" legacy come to life with every passing picture. Then there's the trio of heroes themselves, who often appear more like they've been plucked from a giddy slumber party flick or a Cyndi Lauper video than taking center stage as seriously empowered champions in an action-adventure offering. All of these failings combine to make this production more of a forgettable placeholder in the Marvel mythology than a standalone feature (not to mention a pale substitute for a sequel to the far-superior film that launched the Captain Marvel franchise in 2019). In short, ""The Marvels"" is as much of a mess as it is a movie, and that's troubling for several reasons. It lends credence to the growing criticism that films like this aren't to be taken seriously. It reinforces the notion that they're cookie-cutter in nature, easily interchangeable with one another. And it raises questions about the career choices of lead actress Brie Larson, who, though quite capable of playing roles like these, is running the risk of becoming type-cast, a troubling prospect for an Academy Award-winning actress who possesses a depth of talent and is handily adept at taking on better and more serious material than this. In the wake of this release, Marvel Studios should take a step back and seriously assess where its future is headed, especially if movies like this are any indication. As pictures like ""Wakanda Forever"" (2022) show, the studio is capable of better work - and it's time to show viewers that."
"Marvels","Sleepin_Dragon","10 November 2023",410,"Carol Danvers is attempting to save the universe, but her incredible powers become entangled with those of Kamala Khan and Monica Rambeau, they must unite to save the world.Ouch, what can you say, this is surely one of Marvel's lowest points, I honestly don't know who the target audience is, or who this is going to appeal to, young teens only maybe? Anyhow, this was an absolute mess.The writing was clearly problematic, it doesn't gel, it is genuinely all over the place. I do very much wonder if huge sections of this film cut? It can be the only answer, it just doesn't flow at all, and that short run time...Special effects, some were pretty good, some were poor, I just wish there was a greater focus on plot, it just seemed like 100 minutes of CGI, noise and random events.Brie Larson, I'm not sure about you, but to me she looked totally disinterested and bored by the whole thing, what I didn't see, was someone committed to the role. I thought Samuel Jackson was rather good, but again poorly served by the script.It didn't look great from the trailers, and in reality, it's another clunker from Marvel Studios.4/10."
"Marvels","judywalker2","14 December 2023",510,"Went to see this movie with my 17- and 11-year-old granddaughters. One is a Ms. Marvel fan and the other is now.

I also loved Wanda Vision and the introduction of Monica Rambeau and I was hoping for at least a good continuation of her story. I didn't watch Ms. Marvel because I'm not a teen and I knew it wasn't for me; and after watching her parts in this movie I'm glad I stuck to that.All three actresses are good and of course Samuel L in always a pleasure to see, but none of the other characters including the so-called villain were the least bit interesting. Most of the scenes were just downright silly. I hope they continue Monica's story with better writing and I wish Marvel would stop being silly and go back to making movies for adults and kids."
"Marvels","isaacsundaralingam","11 November 2023",310,"The MCU has absolutely overstayed its welcome. Post Avengers Endgame, these projects have been feeling more and more like content than cinema (except the rare surprises like GOTG 3). Superhero fatigue, they call it and this movie does practically nothing but to amp it up to 11.You watch the trailer, you know what happens. You bet on originality, you end up homeless. There's nothing new for me to say that I haven't already said about any of the other MCU content as of late. It's so generic that I'm confident a year from now, no one would remember this movie even existed. With every new MCU project, the jokes-per-minute ratio keeps getting worse, the villains are a writer's version of a stock photograph (I can't even remember the villain's name in this movie and it hasn't even been a day since I watched it), the CGI is so out there you can almost see the CGI artists' tears on screen, and it's getting more and more difficult to tell each MCU project apart cos they're all just the same.The only few positives I can identify here are actresses Iman Vellani and Brie Larson (Larson, who seems much more relaxed and settled into her superhero boots), and maybe the flashy action sequences. Otherwise, there's nothing here to watch, nothing here to experience and nothing here to enjoy. What a shame."
"Marvels","MrDHWong","9 November 2023",410,"""The Marvels"" is the sequel to 2019's ""Captain Marvel"", a continuation of the Disney+ series ""Ms. Marvel"", and the 33rd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris, and Iman Vellani, it represents a painful look at the downward spiral the MCU has found itself caught in since the end of Phase 3.Sometime after the events of ""Captain Marvel"", Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) has unintentionally started a civil war among the alien race known as the Kree. The leader of the Kree, Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton), soon finds one half of the Quantum Bands and later seeks out the other half, which is in the possession of Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel (Iman Vellani). At the request of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Carol teams up with Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) to negotiate peace among the Kree, but as the two investigate a wormhole in outer space, Monica, Carol, and Kamala start mysteriously switching powers with one another. Realising something is amiss, the trio are forced to work together to figure out what is causing this strange phenomena and hopefully put a stop to both Dar-Benn and the warring Kree.It's becoming harder and harder to call myself fan of the MCU, given the array of serviceable to terrible projects they have been churning out lately. To be fair though, it is a tall order to top something as ambitious as the culmination of over ten years worth of universe building after both ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and ""Avengers: Endgame"" pulled it off so effectively years ago. For the longest time, I have been willing to defend the post-Endgame MCU for trying different things, as I was under the impression that all of this would be leading to exciting new projects on the horizon. However, after sitting through ""The Marvels"", I can say with a hint of heartbreak that practically all of my optimism for the MCU's future has all but disappeared, as it contains next to nothing worth defending from a creative standpoint.Perhaps the best way to describe my viewing experience with this film would be ""apathetic"", because at no point does it ever feel like anything important is at stake. This is mainly due to either our three heroes being too overpowered or there not being enough information provided about the ones who need saving. Whenever a horde of enemies are swarming the trio, we watch as the three of them effortlessly take them out without even breaking a sweat. Action-packed moments like these that once elicited excitement have now been reduced to a series of bland fistfights and generic CGI blasts that have all been done before in better MCU films.We see Carol Danvers quickly blast everyone away with her energy beams and block punches with her hands, never once showing any signs that she is in real danger. Her accomplice Monica Rambeau does pretty much the same thing, only with less time on screen. Even Kamala Khan, who is the biggest fish-out-of-water in this situation, has no major trouble dealing with foes coming at her from every angle, always using her half of the Quantum Band to her advantage. How is it possible to keep the audience on their toes if the enemy forces are so inefficient that even an inexperienced child can wipe the floor with them this easily? On that note, it also doesn't help that none of these three heroes appear to have any physical weaknesses or personal insecurities holding them back, which causes all of the tension to evaporate instantly.In addition to this, we are barely shown anything interesting about the Kree that will keep the audience invested in their role in the story. As far as the film is concerned, they are nothing more than a stock species of extraterrestrials that are causing problems simply because the plot demands it. The original ""Captain Marvel"" film established that the Kree were the ones who inadvertently gave Carol her powers and took her in among them. Yet, this film never reminds the audience of that, instead opting to throw them right into the thick of the conflict without any important context. As a result, I just did not care at all about what happened to any of these people.It's also worth mentioning that this film is rife with obvious re-edits and tonal inconsistencies. One scene where this is most evident is where Carol Danvers is opening up to both Rambeau and Khan about her relationship with the Kree. What could have been a good method of showcasing Danvers's humanity is instead brushed aside for something completely unrelated after less than two minutes. I couldn't help but assume that this scene was supposed to go on much longer but was cut in post production for whatever reason. To add insult to injury, the scene is then immediately followed by a strange attempt at comic relief which fails to raise even a single laugh. Although Marvel films are known for their blending of comedy with drama, a moment like this felt like a rather tacky addition to the film that only hampers the already poor narrative structure. Worse still, there are other similar occurrences like this throughout the rest of the story.One of the biggest problems with the original ""Captain Marvel"" film was how weakly written the title character was, with her lack of likeable character traits and overly serious demeanour being a major reason why she is not viewed favourably by fans. You'd expect the filmmakers to remedy this problem for the sequel, but you would be wrong. I'm not sure whether it's Brie Larson's underwhelming performance or just plain old bad writing but I have never once felt any fondness for Carol Danvers as a person. As mentioned above, she efficiently fights her way through many bad guys with no issue whatsoever, never once showing any emotional weakness or other potential vulnerabilities. Because of this, Carol Danvers never feels like a real person, being nothing more than a one-dimensional superhero that is practically impossible for anybody to identify with. Her character has not changed or grown since the first film, and it looks like she won't be doing so anytime soon.I keep trying to remind myself of Monica Rambeau's contribution to the story but nothing memorable ever comes to mind without doing some kind of online research. Like Brie Larson, there is nothing especially remarkable about Teyonah Parris's performance, as her character is as bland as she comes. Though it is established that Rambeau looked up to Carol Danvers as a child, her role in this story is nothing more than playing second fiddle to an already dull lead protagonist. Yes, Rambeau is very strong and yes, she is more than capable of taking care of herself in a fight, but beyond that what else does she offer? Most of the time she just goes along with Danvers's orders without ever questioning her or giving her personal opinions, making her nothing more than a blind follower. I was hoping to have seen some kind of opposing dynamic between Danvers and Rambeau, as that would have given their characters an important amount of depth the distinguish the two from one another. No such luck I'm afraid.The only character I sort of cared about was Kamala Khan, whose childlike naiveté made her the most relatable of the three leads. In her feature film debut, Iman Vellani does carry over many of Khan's human traits from the Disney+ series ""Ms. Marvel"", being that she's still young and coming to terms with mastering her powers. Unfortunately, she does not achieve this through the character herself, but rather due to how woefully underwritten her two co-stars are in comparison. I wanted to see the three as kindred spirits, fighting as trio but standing out as individuals. Instead, all we get are two dull, stoic, overpowered adults and a young kid working together for no other reason than because the writers said so.As depressing as it sounds, the once mighty MCU is showing no signs of improvement as ""The Marvels"" just may be the worst film in the series so far. There simply isn't enough reason to justify its existence outside of some kind of contractual obligation by the higher ups at Disney, and I fully respect many people's decision to skip it altogether. At this point, I seriously doubt the MCU can ever return to its former glory, as this film is set to become the series' biggest box office bomb to date. I can only hope in vain that Disney will learn an important lesson from this film's failure, but knowing their track record that seems unlikely.I rate it 4/10."
"Marvels","danieljfarthing","9 January 2024",110,"2019's ""Captain Marvel"" wasn't too bad, for a superhero movie, but its sequel ""The Marvels"" is an unmitigated stinking disaster - the WORST Marvel movie to date (which is saying something). Set a decade or two after the original, Brie Larson (via Samuel L Jackson) teams somewhat inadvertently with Teyonah Parris & Iman Vellani (awful) to save Gary Lewis' people (what happened to previous leader Ben Mendelsohn?!) from evil Zawe Ashton. Director Nia DaCosta (who also co-wrote this tripe with Megan McDonnell & Elissa Karasik) creates a headache inducing, fast (as if bizarrely sped up), frantic, thoroughly annoying, tiresome piece of garbage. Absolutely dreadful."
"Marvels","altugozhan","12 November 2023",210,"I just want to know who is responsible for MCUs phase 4 and how he or she can still be employedThere are 0(zero) good movies and only 1 or 2 tv shows that are watchable over a total of 20 productions and this is one of the bottom ranked ones. Marvel did a fantastic job over the decade, earned trust of fans besides billions of dollars and they are wasting it like there is no tomorrow.I don't know how a franchise can change so drastically from hero to zero.I have watched every marvel movie out there and this is equally as bad as she-hulk.Story is definitely boring, protagonists are boring, antagonist is boring, action is boring, battles are boring, some scenes are absurd and ridiculous.I have absolutely nothing good to say about this movie. Don't waste your money or your time.Looks like the movie is only made to make money in India."
"Marvels","ThereelscoopwithKK","10 November 2023",110,"This second installment makes the original Captain Marvel look like a cinematic masterpiece... Nothing about this movie works. Although Brie Larson's acting has improved over the years it feels like she doesn't want to be there for this at all. Further, when you break it down, there is really no story at all happening. In fact, the solution to the entire problem is so extremely simple and solvable that you really wonder why there was a conflict in the first place. So much of everything is unexplained and eventually you stop trying to figure it out because you eventually lose all interest . Samuel L Jackson's character , Nick Fury, is hardly even a shell of his former self and is essentially now demoted to comedic relief.The scenes don't really mesh together at all. None of them are really necessary to advancing a plot and all feature the same repeated choreographic battle. The villain lacks any real charisma and is only provided a very brief backstory. Overall she never feels like too much of a threat.There's one part in particular that I think is absolutely a candidate for worst sequence of 2023. Without spoiling it , it is essentially a planet that looks like a cheap rip off of the Wizard of Oz. It just captures all of the problems with this movie into one scene. There's been a lot of less than stellar work from Marvel since endgame, but this is reaching new depths.I'm not even going to get started on the cats scene with the theme song....Please Loki, reset the entire timeline."
"Marvels","Avwillfan89","23 December 2023",110,"This film is somehow way more depressing and worse than Ant Man Quantumania. We honestly thought Eternals was bad, but that was only the beginning. It was only going to go downhill from there.Watching this movie felt like watching a beloved friend in a coma fighting for her life. It was sad, frustrating and ultimately hopeless. So much potential squandered right before our very eyes.Much has been said about the Girl Power aspect of this story, but it doesn't mean jack when the characters are so thinly written. After the big character tension build up between Carol and Monica, with the latter resenting her for not coming back, their fractures mend themselves very quickly. There is no chemistry between the the two at all.The villain is Bland with a capitol B, and highly forgettable.Nick Fury is actually pathetic in this movie. He doesn't at all act like the Fury we know and love. He was more in character in Far From Home when Talos was impersonating him!I don't think I've ever had this much of a bad experience with a film since Cats. And it is telling that there actually features a ludicrous scene involving baby flerkens and the song Memory.What the actual hell, Marvel?The only good thing is that it is mercifully short, and Iman Vellani does seem to be enjoying herself in the role.Once a great studio, brought crumbling down on itself. If I could give it zero stars, I would."
"Marvels","chenp-54708","10 November 2023",210,"Marvel movies really have fallen apart haven't they? This is definitely one of the worst Marvels movie I have seen out of all the Marvel movies I had watched. There really isn't too much to say about the movie because ""The Marvels"" is pretty much like almost every single Marvel movie but the writing, humor, direction, and performances are pretty much all over the place. Director Nia DaCosta has made ""Little Woods"" which I liked but her direction here is pretty bad and goes all over the place.The special effects are kind of rough on the edges, the actions and thrills were just okay and the performances, despite a pretty good cast, they aren't very good. Brie Larson is an actress I like but unfortunately her performance felt weak and lacking. The other performances as well including the child performances. The story isn't interesting as the writing is pretty bland and none of the characters were interesting. With a short runtime, the movie surprisingly was really boring.I do like superhero movies but it seems this one really just sucked. Overall, it's bad."
"Marvels","kevin_robbins","12 November 2023",310,"My wife and I recently caught Marvel's (2023) in theaters. The plot revolves around Captain Marvel's mistake in choosing sides during a battle, disrupting the cosmic balance. Two young ladies gain powers in the process, and Captain Marvel must collaborate with them to rectify her error and restore equilibrium to the universe.Directed by Nia DaCosta (Candyman) and featuring Brie Larson (Lessons in Chemistry), Teyonah Parris (Dear White People), Iman Vellani (Ms. Marvel), Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction), and Zawe Ashton (Blitz).This film boasts clean and classic Marvel-style characters, cinematography, action scenes, and special effects. However, the plot seems somewhat lackluster, with Captain Marvel possibly appearing more as a villain than a hero. The backstories of the heroes lack sufficient development, making it challenging to form a connection with them. The cat steals the show initially but feels overdone by the end, and even Samuel L. Jackson's wit falls short of expectations.In summary, this superhero movie prioritizes its message over a compelling storyline. While the characters and visuals are in line with Marvel's trademark style, the plot may leave audiences indifferent. The lack of character depth and an engaging storyline earns this film a 3/10, making it a skip-worthy experience."
"Marvels","SHU_Movies","10 November 2023",310,"Going from the Loki Series Finale this morning to The Marvels this evening was (for lack of a better word) bonkers! The finale was perfect, and a beautiful ending to the show, while The Marvels is a complete mess. It's honestly given me whiplashThe Marvels is just an all-around bad movie. The script is awful and the story is super rushed and poorly executed, which both have an impact on how well the characters (and in-turn the actors) come-across on-screenThe action and humour are kind of alright, and the VFX are definitely better than anything we've seen in an MCU project since Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness (with the obvious exceptions of Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 and Loki Season 2), but that still doesn't exactly make it look greatThis movie is just painful to watch at points! Early on, it has some really fun moments, and felt like it could have actually been somewhat entertaining, but that feeling vanished as soon as it came. It's barley better than Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania, so you can do with that information what you will."
"Marvels","NanoFrog","16 January 2024",110,"So Stan Lee passes away and we get Disney now in full control of Marvel stories...and boy is there a difference. I could not finish watching this really bad film, it is just junk from scene to scene. The cast, I feel so sorry for them because the cast is a fine group for the most part...but the story, the effects, the directing are all jumbled up into a real mess. The premise is interesting but they have no idea what to do with it. I have never been a fan of Disney, maybe when I was 10 years old, back in the early 60s, but this is not at all Walt Disney. This is Disney INC and a massive number of talentless paperwork and book-keepers make their films these days. This is just junk slammed together by people who have no idea how to tell a story or stage intelligent effects. This film is not a Turkey, it is, in fact, just garbage. RIP MArvel."
"Marvels","OnlyAtJMart","12 November 2023",410,"Anyone who heard the news about this project knows that the production was a nightmare, and it shows in the final product here. It's like they couldn't figure out what direction to go, so they made 4 versions, and blended them together. Which would explain the high budget, the 5 delays, and the reshoots. Kamala's character was probably the best part of the movie. I promise you, the script did her no favors, but she stood out. Her acting was in line with her character. This was probably an exciting opportunity for her, and she wasn't going to let a bad script, and production problems stop her from giving a great effort. However, the story, the dialogue, the musical gimmick, the weak villain. It just didn't work. I don't think the blame lies solely with the actors, or even the director, who did lack the experience for helming a movie with a budget this size. I think Disney interfered heavily with the production, which almost always yields bad results. I think it was doomed to fail. They put so much pressure on this being successful, they forgot to make it coherent, unique, or interesting."
"Marvels","mildlyintrusive","13 November 2023",210,"Once in a while I tend to go to my local theater to check out something new, maybe a new release or a re-run of a movie. Today, I stumbled upon The Marvels, I thought ""Hey, I haven't been going to the theater this month that often, maybe I should try this out?"" And well, it seems that I'd made the wrong decision. The Marvels follows the titular Marvels trying to stop an evil Kree with one disadvantage however, every time they use their powers, it's Freaky Friday.Maybe its because of the very troubled production but everything just feels like an amalgamation of three separate movies, its like a ADHD experience. The movie does NOT take itself seriously at all, and as a result, it makes me hard to care for literally everything! Its like a circus act masquerading as a movie, it doesn't work! There were moments where characters were in danger and they start joking about it every opportunity they get. To add insult to injury was the treatment of the character of Nick Fury, who feels like a completely different character altogether, cracking lame after lame jokes every single time! Special effects were decent, but considering the massive 271M+ budget I wished they could've at least cared about the plot and flesh out some if the characters and their motivations instead of relying on action scene after action scene, it gets tiring after a while you know?Brie Larson herself looks tired and forced in this movie, her character also being this girl-boss who can sweep through enemies in this movie, no weaknesses and no vulnerabilities. It all feels so one-dimensional, it tries to be like a 80s action star with the likes of Arnold and co. But fails because they lack charisma and charm. Because of this I found it impossible to relate to her in any sense of way. Monica Rambeau wasn't trying her best here, and there is no opposing dynamic between the two to the point where I found her virtually indistinguishable from Mrs. Danvers herself. However I do commend Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan, whose child-like personality I was comfortable with and is the standout between the three leads but suffers from being very underwritten and the villain is a copy-and-paste from dozens we've seen before.Overall, a messy and disjointed movie with not much to offer rather than annoying, dreadful humor and some few flashy action scenes. It certainly feels like homework for the MCU as it struggles to keep a hook in something after the Infinity Saga. Skip this one and play with your action figures instead, Im sure it'll be better than this."
"Marvels","critic-97-417657","4 February 2024",810,"The movie was somewhat ridiculous, but I found myself giggling throughout it. It was actually quite fun. There were a lot of really charming things about this movie, and while the storyline lacked any real tension, I didn't really care. It was mostly about the character development, and the relationships between the three main characters. Overall, I just found it really fun and just didn't take it very seriously. In a lot of ways, it is a set up for the rest of the series, and is definitely not a standalone movie. And the post credit scene, amazing. Ties in a lot of potential for what they are going to be doing in this franchise."
"Marvels","The-Sarkologist","7 February 2024",710,"Well, I guess someone was right when they said that one of the big problems with this film was that you had to like watch 8 other films and 3 series to sort of understand what was going on. Mind you, I have actually done just that, but even then with the amount of time that had passed since I watched the other things it was still a little tricky understanding what was happening.Mind you, I did actually quite like the film. Like the scenes where they were switching places whenever they used their powers together, and also the big bad in the film, that was in part trying to save her people, but also attempting to punish Captain Marvel for what she had done to her people. Yeah, as it turned out, when she destroyed the great intelligence it sent the Kree into a massive civil war which basically destroyed their planet.So, if you had seen Miss Marvel, you will know that she has a thing for Captain Marvel, and of course it was always going to be a thing that she was eventually going to be involved in a team up. Also, there were some hints at the end that suggested that there was going to be another team-up film, though apparently that will still be some way off (and the problem will be that, no doubt, when they get around to it, all of them will be too old to be members of a possible Young Avengers - kids do grow up a little too fast).Yeah, I thought that this film was pretty good, though I have to agree that the problem is that you do need to catch up to speed to understand what is going on. Oh, it also seemed that it felt that it was a bit over the place, no doubt because they wanted to make the film shorter than a lot of the others. Still, it's good, especially if you are up to date on the films."
"Marvels","cherold","30 January 2024",710,"After the bad reviews, and considering how many bad superhero movies have come out lately, I would have skipped this one if the trailer didn't look like so much fun. Fortunately, the movie fulfills the trailer's promiseIn the movie, three superheroes with related powers find themselves suddenly swapping places with one another. The proves to be a good gimmick for both action and comedy, as the three keep finding themselves in one another's battles. Eventually, they master the situation in order to take down a very angry villain with an unusually sympathetic backstory.The movie leans heavily - and for the most part successfully - into the comedy. A big chunk of this is fueled by the teenage Captain Marvel fangirl Ms. Marvel, who is from a TV series I found too pre-teen-oriented to enjoy. Ms. Marvel's an annoying character but for the most part I found her amusing in this.There's also a funny gag with alien cats.While I enjoyed this movie, I have to admit its a bit of an unfocussed mess. There are a lot of elements just tossed in, like a whole thing with Marvel #3, Monica, dealing with her abandonment issues. These occasional ""emotional"" moments don't much interest me.Anyway, a lot of people hate this, but if you like the trailer, I'd say chance the movie (I did not take a chance on the last Aquaman movie because unlike The Marvels, the trailer looked just as bad as people said the movie was.Going against the current, I say if you want a bunch of comedy and some fun action then you should watch this one."
"Marvels","drawlife","8 November 2023",510,"THE MARVELS is here and it's a mashed up film that is totally all over the place. It feels as if this film was edited and chopped into pieces during post and it shows.Couple things I enjoyed, I did like seeing Carol Danvers and Monica Rambeau resolve and acknowledge their relationship, but due to the nature of their characters being straight arrows, it allows Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan to be the audience just as Tom Holland's Peter Parker was in CIVIL WAR. I did not particularly enjoy the MS. MARVEL series, but I can see her being the shoutout for many.I think the script just touched on the surface of Brie Larson's Captain Marvel herself, so diving into her more is a plus, however the story did her no favors once again and I did feel like she was given like four or five pieces of direction to portray her character compared to the more one-note performance in the first film. Teyonah Parris is commendable. She was the more science-y of the trio.Samuel L. Jackson just feels inconsistent especially after SECRET INVASION. Feels like this Nick Fury is a variant. He's simply passing through in this film.Another thing I liked was the incursions (also briefly touched on in DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS). We all complained about the lack of planting seeds for the future leading into KANG DYNASTY and SECRET WARS. Finally, this film it at least preps and teases what's to come down the line.The MCU's villain problem is a long known fact, but here it only cements their problem even further. Now I'm a fan of Lee Pace's over the top performance as Ronan, but Dar-Benn played by Zawe Ashton is literally a copy and paste of Ronan, but female. Nothing new about it. Definitely up there as one of the worst villains in the MCU.The power swaps were kinda cool so I can give it that. Nia DaCosta does a good job executing the fight scenes, but again as one should expect, VFX is meh. Now if you cringed during the musical note duel between the two Doctor Strange, then wait till you see one segment of the film where it feels like a misplaced musical. Lots of quirky and annoying humor like one should expect in an MCU film.The Skrulls are in the film and as a fan we always think we can write the better film after watching it, but I just DO NOT understand why this sequel couldn't have been SECRET INVASION(one of the worst MCU Disney+ shows). SECRET INVASION honestly should have been an Avengers film or at the very least a Captain Marvel sequel co-starring some Avengers, kinda like CIVIL WAR. I personally feel like that dilemma could have furthered Captain Marvel's development due to her involvement with them and how she's equally to blame for not helping them out when she and Fury promised to find them a home. But instead she's stuck with this material.The mid-credit scene is arguably the best part. Once again teasing things to come. It's stuff that like that, that will maybe still garner interest in the MCU despite its current fall from grace. The end-credit scene is alright. Not particularly jazzed about that promise down the line.On that note, the recent Variety article published about Marvel Studios talked about their behind the scenes trouble. It was said that Kevin Feige and his creative committee partook in their yearly Palm Springs retreat to regroup and refocus, so here's hoping to next year being more consistent with quality. Seemed like he was spread too thin with the mandate to have more quantity than quality.THE MARVELS is a season 1.5 for MS. MARVEL and a CAPTAIN MARVEL sequel that we never saw due to the flashbacks and exposition to explain things. And let's be clear, at this point everything feels like homework. That was going to be inevitable moving forward after INFINITY WAR and ENDGAMGE, but especially when Disney+ was announced making Kevin Feige spread out too thin. But it only feels like homework because everything that has been released is below the standard of what Marvel set up for us.So to sum it up, while I did find it slightly more appealing than the first CAPTAIN MARVEL and QUANTUMANIA, that isn't saying much. Low expectations definitely helped. Is THE MARVELS one of the worst? No, but it definitely belongs way down below the list.5/10."
"Marvels","tibby_23","17 January 2024",410,"By far the worst Marvel movie so far, I am extremely disappointed. After the mess that Thor 4 was, I was hoping that Marvel learned its lesson, but it seems not. I am honestly happy this movie did bad at the box office, that's what you get for ruining such a great character (I loved Cpt. Marvel from the comics).What makes it bad:
Action moves way too fast from one scene to anotherNo character improvement or growth by the end of the movieThings just happen with no storytellingNot serious enough, too childish for my tasteToo many goofy moments (singing, really? We've come this low, Marvel?)End scenes that try to set the context for next movies seem forced and unnecessaryI also found two good things eventually:
I liked the villain and her story, sympathized with her a bitAt least the movie was not long.These writers should never be hired again."
"Marvels","olcare","10 November 2023",410,"Criticizing specific parts of the movie became confusing for me as there were so many details I wanted to change. This film truly disappointed me, especially since my expectations were already low, and falling below them is a bad sign for Marvel. It had a Thor: Love and Thunder vibe, which I also disliked (4/10). I had been excited after watching Loki in the morning, but it was in vain.For me, the unbearable part was the music. After checking the playlists of movies I've watched for a long time, Marvel had by far the worst compositions. The music was exaggerated, drowning out the impact of fight scenes and making them unbearable. It was like overly noisy background music during a break.Another aspect I didn't like was the main villain. I can't believe Marvel fell into the same mistake again. The villain was poorly written, and Zawe Ashton's performance felt forced, appearing awkward in scenes. One major reason for this was the poor portrayal of the Kree Empire in the MCU. Neglecting the significance of the Kree made Supreme look bad. They could have explained the critical situation of the 'Hala' planet in the film's opening with a 30-35 minute sequence, providing context for the desperation of the Kree.Another thing I found absurd was Monica teleporting to a parallel universe. They portrayed the concept of parallel universes like child's play. Especially after watching Loki Season 2 in the morning, her randomly teleporting or getting stuck in another universe seemed too simplistic.Seeing Professor Beast was surprising and pleasing. The X-Men era is beginning, and despite the poor productions, I'm excited. Brie Larson was good again, carrying her character well. The scene with Monica, Kamala, Danvers vs Dar-Benn was good, thankfully without music. However, despite not being a fan of Kamala Khan, her origin is preserved, and it's not bad. But I feel there's a lack of harmony among our main three characters, and I believe it's a script issue, not an actor one.While I like the idea of saving a planet by traveling through different planets, I didn't like the execution at all. Presenting such a serious and contemporary issue as if it's the simplest thing with childlike music seems somewhat unserious to me.However it turns out, this film paved the way for others and served as a stepping stone. Hopefully, with Beast in Deadpool 3, the overall MCU storyline will improve, abandoning mediocrity urgently; otherwise, it will continue to receive poor ratings.Note: I forgot to mention in the review, but Goose is a fantastic character, and I hope we continue to see this adorable cat. The scene with all the cats was genuinely entertaining, one of the enjoyable moments in 4-5 scenes."
"Marvels","alensufli","8 November 2023",210,"Even writing a review is extremely pointless as we all knew what we were expecting months before but here I am. They even themselves admitted it. The film is a huge disappointment. The plot is all over the place. Actions sequences were sometimes good but sometime were so dumb I didn't know where to look, where to pay attention. I like how they tried to catch the old marvel magic. Yes. They tried. But they utterly failed. Feige pulled off ""wait until the post credit scene to get excited cuz the film itself is boring"" trick again. And it wasn't a ""wow"" for me at least. The theatre was silent throughout and after the film. No one even made a giggling sound. Dead silence. Jokes were landing facedown to the ground every time a character made one. That's right. Every character there is comic relief. And I absolutely don't wanna talk about acting."
"Marvels","S3pt3m63r","18 November 2023",NA,"Unfortunately if you haven't got Disney plus and you don't keep to speed with the tv series, then you this movie won't make much sense as it relies on you knowing what's going on in that universe so far, which I'm not up to date with and involves the Miss Marvels characters which haven't been introduced in the movies. Confusing.I had hoped that following Guardians 3 it could've get much worse for the Marvel universe, at least Guardians has Rocket😂It's hard to find any plot to this movie. Carol Danvers (Captain Marvel) does throw a lot of people through the roof but the plot is a quantum entanglement mess. The movie is blissfully short but feels longer as it's so bad and some people walked out of the theatre. I was so pleasantly when it ended.I think it's about to retire the whole Marvel superhero franchise as this phase is going badly."
"Marvels","nscoby93","10 November 2023",210,"I actually had no intention of watching this film in theaters. Originally, I was just going to wait for its home release on Disney Plus, but after recently rewatching WandaVision, I genuinely wanted to see how they would handle Monica Rambeau and see what they would do with her.So I'll mention the positives for this film first...The movie is actually pretty, I really enjoyed the film aesthetically it looked good. This is very surprising to say as recent Marvel projects are tremendous eye sores.The films central characters, Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) and Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani), were surprisingly good. I had fully anticipated to dislike Captain Marvel and Ms Marvel in this film but I surprisingly enjoyed them both which is a big compliment coming from me, and Monica Rambeau is my favorite of the three she was good as I expected and anticipated. All three actresses gave enjoyable performances, and they all worked well together on screen.Then, of course, Samuel Jackson is always great! And the return of everyone's favorite Flerken kitty Goose. She had a great sequence that I refuse to spoil, but it had me dying. Goose saved this film!And well that's it...This film is just bad. Bad writing, bad pacing, bad storytelling. Nothing in this film is properly set up as it rushes through its 1 hour and 45 minute run time. Which is quite frankly fine for me as I genuinely did not want more of this.This movie as a whole is just overwhelmingly safe. It has no stakes, takes no risks, and does nothing. But there is actual enjoyment in its failings. It was so bad that it was good. The amount of eye rolling, face palms, and sighs I gave through this film was astonishing. I gave up on this film within the first 30 minutes, and afterward, that's when the enjoyment began because of how bad it went on to be.Then suddenly, out of nowhere, the film became a musical? Like what is happening? This film is so chaotic and unstructured. It just never stopped.The film had a good mid-credit scene so you know stay for that. Unfortunately, it was spoiled for me, so it didn't hit as hard as it could have. Especially if you're a fan of the actor who originally played the character the scene introduces.But The Marvels was exactly what I anticipated it to be, a below average dump. Which is a shame because they play with some interesting concepts in this film, but they do nothing with them, or they are just poorly handled. I can at least say I didn't hate this movie. Unfortunately, I just enjoyed it for all the wrong reasons.IMDb: 3/10

"Marvels","brentsbulletinboard","11 November 2023",510,"When I first heard the title of this movie, I thought it was about a 1960s girls' singing group. And, frankly, that would have probably made for a better movie. Writer-director Nia DaCosta's third feature outing and the latest in the Marvel Universe paradigm is a wildly inconsistent superhero movie that tries too hard to do too much and doesn't have a script to support it. Too many of its plot elements aren't adequately explained until well into the story, while others aren't explained at all, leaving viewers who aren't comic book laureates wondering what's going on (particularly at film's end). Meanwhile, other narrative aspects frequently appear gimmicky and grow old quickly, such as the introduction of the primary superpower that its three protagonists share, one that almost becomes slapstickish after an all-too-brief while. On top of that, the CGI effects vacillate from one end of the quality spectrum to the other, creating a mix of images that are either startling to look at or stunningly cheesy at best. Add to that a villain that isn't particularly menacing, along with attempts at humor that either succeed brilliantly (cat lovers take note) or fall flat and look incredibly lame (as aficionados of musical theater will undoubtedly attest), all of which further add to the picture's pervasive inconsistency. The inclusion of ample clues for advancing the overarching Marvel Universe storyline continues here, too, furthering a trend that's growing tiresome in the studio's releases, a development akin to the ""Paul is dead"" legacy come to life with every passing picture. Then there's the trio of heroes themselves, who often appear more like they've been plucked from a giddy slumber party flick or a Cyndi Lauper video than taking center stage as seriously empowered champions in an action-adventure offering. All of these failings combine to make this production more of a forgettable placeholder in the Marvel mythology than a standalone feature (not to mention a pale substitute for a sequel to the far-superior film that launched the Captain Marvel franchise in 2019). In short, ""The Marvels"" is as much of a mess as it is a movie, and that's troubling for several reasons. It lends credence to the growing criticism that films like this aren't to be taken seriously. It reinforces the notion that they're cookie-cutter in nature, easily interchangeable with one another. And it raises questions about the career choices of lead actress Brie Larson, who, though quite capable of playing roles like these, is running the risk of becoming type-cast, a troubling prospect for an Academy Award-winning actress who possesses a depth of talent and is handily adept at taking on better and more serious material than this. In the wake of this release, Marvel Studios should take a step back and seriously assess where its future is headed, especially if movies like this are any indication. As pictures like ""Wakanda Forever"" (2022) show, the studio is capable of better work - and it's time to show viewers that."
"Marvels","Sleepin_Dragon","10 November 2023",410,"Carol Danvers is attempting to save the universe, but her incredible powers become entangled with those of Kamala Khan and Monica Rambeau, they must unite to save the world.Ouch, what can you say, this is surely one of Marvel's lowest points, I honestly don't know who the target audience is, or who this is going to appeal to, young teens only maybe? Anyhow, this was an absolute mess.The writing was clearly problematic, it doesn't gel, it is genuinely all over the place. I do very much wonder if huge sections of this film cut? It can be the only answer, it just doesn't flow at all, and that short run time...Special effects, some were pretty good, some were poor, I just wish there was a greater focus on plot, it just seemed like 100 minutes of CGI, noise and random events.Brie Larson, I'm not sure about you, but to me she looked totally disinterested and bored by the whole thing, what I didn't see, was someone committed to the role. I thought Samuel Jackson was rather good, but again poorly served by the script.It didn't look great from the trailers, and in reality, it's another clunker from Marvel Studios.4/10."
"Marvels","judywalker2","14 December 2023",510,"Went to see this movie with my 17- and 11-year-old granddaughters. One is a Ms. Marvel fan and the other is now. For me I was hoping for something that children and adults could enjoy. But, no only kids will enjoy this silly mess.I enjoyed the Captain Marvel movie and thought the criticism was not warranted. I also loved Wanda Vision and the introduction of Monica Rambeau and I was hoping for at least a good continuation of her story. I didn't watch Ms. Marvel because I'm not a teen and I knew it wasn't for me; and after watching her parts in this movie I'm glad I stuck to that.All three actresses are good and of course Samuel L in always a pleasure to see, but none of the other characters including the so-called villain were the least bit interesting. Most of the scenes were just downright silly. I hope they continue Monica's story with better writing and I wish Marvel would stop being silly and go back to making movies for adults and kids."
"Marvels","isaacsundaralingam","11 November 2023",310,"The MCU has absolutely overstayed its welcome. Post Avengers Endgame, these projects have been feeling more and more like content than cinema (except the rare surprises like GOTG 3). Superhero fatigue, they call it and this movie does practically nothing but to amp it up to 11.You watch the trailer, you know what happens. You bet on originality, you end up homeless. There's nothing new for me to say that I haven't already said about any of the other MCU content as of late. It's so generic that I'm confident a year from now, no one would remember this movie even existed. With every new MCU project, the jokes-per-minute ratio keeps getting worse, the villains are a writer's version of a stock photograph (I can't even remember the villain's name in this movie and it hasn't even been a day since I watched it), the CGI is so out there you can almost see the CGI artists' tears on screen, and it's getting more and more difficult to tell each MCU project apart cos they're all just the same.The only few positives I can identify here are actresses Iman Vellani and Brie Larson (Larson, who seems much more relaxed and settled into her superhero boots), and maybe the flashy action sequences. Otherwise, there's nothing here to watch, nothing here to experience and nothing here to enjoy. What a shame."
"Marvels","MrDHWong","9 November 2023",410,"""The Marvels"" is the sequel to 2019's ""Captain Marvel"", a continuation of the Disney+ series ""Ms. Marvel"", and the 33rd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris, and Iman Vellani, it represents a painful look at the downward spiral the MCU has found itself caught in since the end of Phase 3.Sometime after the events of ""Captain Marvel"", Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) has unintentionally started a civil war among the alien race known as the Kree. The leader of the Kree, Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton), soon finds one half of the Quantum Bands and later seeks out the other half, which is in the possession of Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel (Iman Vellani). At the request of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Carol teams up with Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) to negotiate peace among the Kree, but as the two investigate a wormhole in outer space, Monica, Carol, and Kamala start mysteriously switching powers with one another. Realising something is amiss, the trio are forced to work together to figure out what is causing this strange phenomena and hopefully put a stop to both Dar-Benn and the warring Kree.It's becoming harder and harder to call myself fan of the MCU, given the array of serviceable to terrible projects they have been churning out lately. To be fair though, it is a tall order to top something as ambitious as the culmination of over ten years worth of universe building after both ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and ""Avengers: Endgame"" pulled it off so effectively years ago. For the longest time, I have been willing to defend the post-Endgame MCU for trying different things, as I was under the impression that all of this would be leading to exciting new projects on the horizon. However, after sitting through ""The Marvels"", I can say with a hint of heartbreak that practically all of my optimism for the MCU's future has all but disappeared, as it contains next to nothing worth defending from a creative standpoint.Perhaps the best way to describe my viewing experience with this film would be ""apathetic"", because at no point does it ever feel like anything important is at stake. This is mainly due to either our three heroes being too overpowered or there not being enough information provided about the ones who need saving. Whenever a horde of enemies are swarming the trio, we watch as the three of them effortlessly take them out without even breaking a sweat. Action-packed moments like these that once elicited excitement have now been reduced to a series of bland fistfights and generic CGI blasts that have all been done before in better MCU films.We see Carol Danvers quickly blast everyone away with her energy beams and block punches with her hands, never once showing any signs that she is in real danger. Her accomplice Monica Rambeau does pretty much the same thing, only with less time on screen. Even Kamala Khan, who is the biggest fish-out-of-water in this situation, has no major trouble dealing with foes coming at her from every angle, always using her half of the Quantum Band to her advantage. How is it possible to keep the audience on their toes if the enemy forces are so inefficient that even an inexperienced child can wipe the floor with them this easily? On that note, it also doesn't help that none of these three heroes appear to have any physical weaknesses or personal insecurities holding them back, which causes all of the tension to evaporate instantly.In addition to this, we are barely shown anything interesting about the Kree that will keep the audience invested in their role in the story. As far as the film is concerned, they are nothing more than a stock species of extraterrestrials that are causing problems simply because the plot demands it. The original ""Captain Marvel"" film established that the Kree were the ones who inadvertently gave Carol her powers and took her in among them. Yet, this film never reminds the audience of that, instead opting to throw them right into the thick of the conflict without any important context. As a result, I just did not care at all about what happened to any of these people.It's also worth mentioning that this film is rife with obvious re-edits and tonal inconsistencies. One scene where this is most evident is where Carol Danvers is opening up to both Rambeau and Khan about her relationship with the Kree. What could have been a good method of showcasing Danvers's humanity is instead brushed aside for something completely unrelated after less than two minutes. I couldn't help but assume that this scene was supposed to go on much longer but was cut in post production for whatever reason. To add insult to injury, the scene is then immediately followed by a strange attempt at comic relief which fails to raise even a single laugh. Although Marvel films are known for their blending of comedy with drama, a moment like this felt like a rather tacky addition to the film that only hampers the already poor narrative structure. Worse still, there are other similar occurrences like this throughout the rest of the story.One of the biggest problems with the original ""Captain Marvel"" film was how weakly written the title character was, with her lack of likeable character traits and overly serious demeanour being a major reason why she is not viewed favourably by fans. You'd expect the filmmakers to remedy this problem for the sequel, but you would be wrong. I'm not sure whether it's Brie Larson's underwhelming performance or just plain old bad writing but I have never once felt any fondness for Carol Danvers as a person. As mentioned above, she efficiently fights her way through many bad guys with no issue whatsoever, never once showing any emotional weakness or other potential vulnerabilities. Because of this, Carol Danvers never feels like a real person, being nothing more than a one-dimensional superhero that is practically impossible for anybody to identify with. Her character has not changed or grown since the first film, and it looks like she won't be doing so anytime soon.I keep trying to remind myself of Monica Rambeau's contribution to the story but nothing memorable ever comes to mind without doing some kind of online research. Like Brie Larson, there is nothing especially remarkable about Teyonah Parris's performance, as her character is as bland as she comes. Though it is established that Rambeau looked up to Carol Danvers as a child, her role in this story is nothing more than playing second fiddle to an already dull lead protagonist. Yes, Rambeau is very strong and yes, she is more than capable of taking care of herself in a fight, but beyond that what else does she offer? Most of the time she just goes along with Danvers's orders without ever questioning her or giving her personal opinions, making her nothing more than a blind follower. I was hoping to have seen some kind of opposing dynamic between Danvers and Rambeau, as that would have given their characters an important amount of depth the distinguish the two from one another. No such luck I'm afraid.The only character I sort of cared about was Kamala Khan, whose childlike naiveté made her the most relatable of the three leads. In her feature film debut, Iman Vellani does carry over many of Khan's human traits from the Disney+ series ""Ms. Marvel"", being that she's still young and coming to terms with mastering her powers. Unfortunately, she does not achieve this through the character herself, but rather due to how woefully underwritten her two co-stars are in comparison. I wanted to see the three as kindred spirits, fighting as trio but standing out as individuals. Instead, all we get are two dull, stoic, overpowered adults and a young kid working together for no other reason than because the writers said so.As depressing as it sounds, the once mighty MCU is showing no signs of improvement as ""The Marvels"" just may be the worst film in the series so far. There simply isn't enough reason to justify its existence outside of some kind of contractual obligation by the higher ups at Disney, and I fully respect many people's decision to skip it altogether. At this point, I seriously doubt the MCU can ever return to its former glory, as this film is set to become the series' biggest box office bomb to date. I can only hope in vain that Disney will learn an important lesson from this film's failure, but knowing their track record that seems unlikely.I rate it 4/10."
"Marvels","danieljfarthing","9 January 2024",110,"2019's ""Captain Marvel"" wasn't too bad, for a superhero movie, but its sequel ""The Marvels"" is an unmitigated stinking disaster - the WORST Marvel movie to date (which is saying something). Set a decade or two after the original, Brie Larson (via Samuel L Jackson) teams somewhat inadvertently with Teyonah Parris & Iman Vellani (awful) to save Gary Lewis' people (what happened to previous leader Ben Mendelsohn?!) from evil Zawe Ashton. Director Nia DaCosta (who also co-wrote this tripe with Megan McDonnell & Elissa Karasik) creates a headache inducing, fast (as if bizarrely sped up), frantic, thoroughly annoying, tiresome piece of garbage. Absolutely dreadful."

Marvel did a fantastic job over the decade, earned trust of fans besides billions of dollars and they are wasting it like there is no tomorrow.I don't know how a franchise can change so drastically from hero to zero.I have watched every marvel movie out there and this is equally as bad as she-hulk.Story is definitely boring, protagonists are boring, antagonist is boring, action is boring, battles are boring, some scenes are absurd and ridiculous.I have absolutely nothing good to say about this movie. Don't waste your money or your time.Looks like the movie is only made to make money in India."
"Marvels","ThereelscoopwithKK","10 November 2023",110,"This second installment makes the original Captain Marvel look like a cinematic masterpiece... Nothing about this movie works. Although Brie Larson's acting has improved over the years it feels like she doesn't want to be there for this at all. Further, when you break it down, there is really no story at all happening. In fact, the solution to the entire problem is so extremely simple and solvable that you really wonder why there was a conflict in the first place. So much of everything is unexplained and eventually you stop trying to figure it out because you eventually lose all interest . Samuel L Jackson's character , Nick Fury, is hardly even a shell of his former self and is essentially now demoted to comedic relief.The scenes don't really mesh together at all. None of them are really necessary to advancing a plot and all feature the same repeated choreographic battle. The villain lacks any real charisma and is only provided a very brief backstory. Overall she never feels like too much of a threat.There's one part in particular that I think is absolutely a candidate for worst sequence of 2023. Without spoiling it , it is essentially a planet that looks like a cheap rip off of the Wizard of Oz. It just captures all of the problems with this movie into one scene. There's been a lot of less than stellar work from Marvel since endgame, but this is reaching new depths.I'm not even going to get started on the cats scene with the theme song....Please Loki, reset the entire timeline."
"Marvels","Avwillfan89","23 December 2023",110,"This film is somehow way more depressing and worse than Ant Man Quantumania. We honestly thought Eternals was bad, but that was only the beginning. It was only going to go downhill from there.Watching this movie felt like watching a beloved friend in a coma fighting for her life. It was sad, frustrating and ultimately hopeless. So much potential squandered right before our very eyes.Much has been said about the Girl Power aspect of this story, but it doesn't mean jack when the characters are so thinly written. After the big character tension build up between Carol and Monica, with the latter resenting her for not coming back, their fractures mend themselves very quickly. There is no chemistry between the the two at all.The villain is Bland with a capitol B, and highly forgettable.Nick Fury is actually pathetic in this movie. He doesn't at all act like the Fury we know and love. He was more in character in Far From Home when Talos was impersonating him!I don't think I've ever had this much of a bad experience with a film since Cats. And it is telling that there actually features a ludicrous scene involving baby flerkens and the song Memory.What the actual hell, Marvel?The only good thing is that it is mercifully short, and Iman Vellani does seem to be enjoying herself in the role.Once a great studio, brought crumbling down on itself. If I could give it zero stars, I would."
"Marvels","chenp-54708","10 November 2023",210,"Marvel movies really have fallen apart haven't they? This is definitely one of the worst Marvels movie I have seen out of all the Marvel movies I had watched. There really isn't too much to say about the movie because ""The Marvels"" is pretty much like almost every single Marvel movie but the writing, humor, direction, and performances are pretty much all over the place. Director Nia DaCosta has made ""Little Woods"" which I liked but her direction here is pretty bad and goes all over the place.The special effects are kind of rough on the edges, the actions and thrills were just okay and the performances, despite a pretty good cast, they aren't very good. Brie Larson is an actress I like but unfortunately her performance felt weak and lacking. The other performances as well including the child performances. The story isn't interesting as the writing is pretty bland and none of the characters were interesting. With a short runtime, the movie surprisingly was really boring.I do like superhero movies but it seems this one really just sucked. Overall, it's bad."
"Marvels","kevin_robbins","12 November 2023",310,"My wife and I recently caught Marvel's (2023) in theaters. The plot revolves around Captain Marvel's mistake in choosing sides during a battle, disrupting the cosmic balance. Two young ladies gain powers in the process, and Captain Marvel must collaborate with them to rectify her error and restore equilibrium to the universe.Directed by Nia DaCosta (Candyman) and featuring Brie Larson (Lessons in Chemistry), Teyonah Parris (Dear White People), Iman Vellani (Ms. Marvel), Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction), and Zawe Ashton (Blitz).This film boasts clean and classic Marvel-style characters, cinematography, action scenes, and special effects. However, the plot seems somewhat lackluster, with Captain Marvel possibly appearing more as a villain than a hero. The backstories of the heroes lack sufficient development, making it challenging to form a connection with them. The cat steals the show initially but feels overdone by the end, and even Samuel L. Jackson's wit falls short of expectations.In summary, this superhero movie prioritizes its message over a compelling storyline. While the characters and visuals are in line with Marvel's trademark style, the plot may leave audiences indifferent. The lack of character depth and an engaging storyline earns this film a 3/10, making it a skip-worthy experience."
"Marvels","SHU_Movies","10 November 2023",310,"Going from the Loki Series Finale this morning to The Marvels this evening was (for lack of a better word) bonkers! The finale was perfect, and a beautiful ending to the show, while The Marvels is a complete mess. It's honestly given me whiplashThe Marvels is just an all-around bad movie. The script is awful and the story is super rushed and poorly executed, which both have an impact on how well the characters (and in-turn the actors) come-across on-screenThe action and humour are kind of alright, and the VFX are definitely better than anything we've seen in an MCU project since Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness (with the obvious exceptions of Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 and Loki Season 2), but that still doesn't exactly make it look greatThis movie is just painful to watch at points! Early on, it has some really fun moments, and felt like it could have actually been somewhat entertaining, but that feeling vanished as soon as it came. It's barley better than Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania, so you can do with that information what you will."
"Marvels","NanoFrog","16 January 2024",110,"So Stan Lee passes away and we get Disney now in full control of Marvel stories...and boy is there a difference. I could not finish watching this really bad film, it is just junk from scene to scene. The cast, I feel so sorry for them because the cast is a fine group for the most part...but the story, the effects, the directing are all jumbled up into a real mess. The premise is interesting but they have no idea what to do with it. I have never been a fan of Disney, maybe when I was 10 years old, back in the early 60s, but this is not at all Walt Disney. This is Disney INC and a massive number of talentless paperwork and book-keepers make their films these days. This is just junk slammed together by people who have no idea how to tell a story or stage intelligent effects. This film is not a Turkey, it is, in fact, just garbage. RIP MArvel."
"Marvels","OnlyAtJMart","12 November 2023",410,"Anyone who heard the news about this project knows that the production was a nightmare, and it shows in the final product here. It's like they couldn't figure out what direction to go, so they made 4 versions, and blended them together. Which would explain the high budget, the 5 delays, and the reshoots. Kamala's character was probably the best part of the movie. I promise you, the script did her no favors, but she stood out. Her acting was in line with her character. This was probably an exciting opportunity for her, and she wasn't going to let a bad script, and production problems stop her from giving a great effort. However, the story, the dialogue, the musical gimmick, the weak villain. It just didn't work. I don't think the blame lies solely with the actors, or even the director, who did lack the experience for helming a movie with a budget this size. I think Disney interfered heavily with the production, which almost always yields bad results. I think it was doomed to fail. They put so much pressure on this being successful, they forgot to make it coherent, unique, or interesting."
"Marvels","mildlyintrusive","13 November 2023",210,"Once in a while I tend to go to my local theater to check out something new, maybe a new release or a re-run of a movie. Today, I stumbled upon The Marvels, I thought ""Hey, I haven't been going to the theater this month that often, maybe I should try this out?"" And well, it seems that I'd made the wrong decision. The Marvels follows the titular Marvels trying to stop an evil Kree with one disadvantage however, every time they use their powers, it's Freaky Friday.Maybe its because of the very troubled production but everything just feels like an amalgamation of three separate movies, its like a ADHD experience. The movie does NOT take itself seriously at all, and as a result, it makes me hard to care for literally everything! Its like a circus act masquerading as a movie, it doesn't work! There were moments where characters were in danger and they start joking about it every opportunity they get. To add insult to injury was the treatment of the character of Nick Fury, who feels like a completely different character altogether, cracking lame after lame jokes every single time! Special effects were decent, but considering the massive 271M+ budget I wished they could've at least cared about the plot and flesh out some if the characters and their motivations instead of relying on action scene after action scene, it gets tiring after a while you know?Brie Larson herself looks tired and forced in this movie, her character also being this girl-boss who can sweep through enemies in this movie, no weaknesses and no vulnerabilities. It all feels so one-dimensional, it tries to be like a 80s action star with the likes of Arnold and co. But fails because they lack charisma and charm. Because of this I found it impossible to relate to her in any sense of way. Monica Rambeau wasn't trying her best here, and there is no opposing dynamic between the two to the point where I found her virtually indistinguishable from Mrs. Danvers herself. However I do commend Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan, whose child-like personality I was comfortable with and is the standout between the three leads but suffers from being very underwritten and the villain is a copy-and-paste from dozens we've seen before.Overall, a messy and disjointed movie with not much to offer rather than annoying, dreadful humor and some few flashy action scenes. It certainly feels like homework for the MCU as it struggles to keep a hook in something after the Infinity Saga. Skip this one and play with your action figures instead, Im sure it'll be better than this."
"Marvels","critic-97-417657","4 February 2024",810,"The movie was somewhat ridiculous, but I found myself giggling throughout it. It was actually quite fun. There were a lot of really charming things about this movie, and while the storyline lacked any real tension, I didn't really care. It was mostly about the character development, and the relationships between the three main characters. Overall, I just found it really fun and just didn't take it very seriously. In a lot of ways, it is a set up for the rest of the series, and is definitely not a standalone movie. And the post credit scene, amazing. Ties in a lot of potential for what they are going to be doing in this franchise."
"Marvels","The-Sarkologist","7 February 2024",710,"Well, I guess someone was right when they said that one of the big problems with this film was that you had to like watch 8 other films and 3 series to sort of understand what was going on. Mind you, I have actually done just that, but even then with the amount of time that had passed since I watched the other things it was still a little tricky understanding what was happening.Mind you, I did actually quite like the film. Like the scenes where they were switching places whenever they used their powers together, and also the big bad in the film, that was in part trying to save her people, but also attempting to punish Captain Marvel for what she had done to her people. Yeah, as it turned out, when she destroyed the great intelligence it sent the Kree into a massive civil war which basically destroyed their planet.So, if you had seen Miss Marvel, you will know that she has a thing for Captain Marvel, and of course it was always going to be a thing that she was eventually going to be involved in a team up. Also, there were some hints at the end that suggested that there was going to be another team-up film, though apparently that will still be some way off (and the problem will be that, no doubt, when they get around to it, all of them will be too old to be members of a possible Young Avengers - kids do grow up a little too fast).Yeah, I thought that this film was pretty good, though I have to agree that the problem is that you do need to catch up to speed to understand what is going on. Oh, it also seemed that it felt that it was a bit over the place, no doubt because they wanted to make the film shorter than a lot of the others. Still, it's good, especially if you are up to date on the films."
"Marvels","cherold","30 January 2024",710,"After the bad reviews, and considering how many bad superhero movies have come out lately, I would have skipped this one if the trailer didn't look like so much fun. Fortunately, the movie fulfills the trailer's promiseIn the movie, three superheroes with related powers find themselves suddenly swapping places with one another. The proves to be a good gimmick for both action and comedy, as the three keep finding themselves in one another's battles. Eventually, they master the situation in order to take down a very angry villain with an unusually sympathetic backstory.The movie leans heavily - and for the most part successfully - into the comedy. A big chunk of this is fueled by the teenage Captain Marvel fangirl Ms. Marvel, who is from a TV series I found too pre-teen-oriented to enjoy. Ms. Marvel's an annoying character but for the most part I found her amusing in this.There's also a funny gag with alien cats.While I enjoyed this movie, I have to admit its a bit of an unfocussed mess. There are a lot of elements just tossed in, like a whole thing with Marvel #3, Monica, dealing with her abandonment issues. These occasional ""emotional"" moments don't much interest me.Anyway, a lot of people hate this, but if you like the trailer, I'd say chance the movie (I did not take a chance on the last Aquaman movie because unlike The Marvels, the trailer looked just as bad as people said the movie was.Going against the current, I say if you want a bunch of comedy and some fun action then you should watch this one."
"Marvels","drawlife","8 November 2023",510,"THE MARVELS is here and it's a mashed up film that is totally all over the place. It feels as if this film was edited and chopped into pieces during post and it shows.Couple things I enjoyed, I did like seeing Carol Danvers and Monica Rambeau resolve and acknowledge their relationship, but due to the nature of their characters being straight arrows, it allows Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan to be the audience just as Tom Holland's Peter Parker was in CIVIL WAR. I did not particularly enjoy the MS. MARVEL series, but I can see her being the shoutout for many.I think the script just touched on the surface of Brie Larson's Captain Marvel herself, so diving into her more is a plus, however the story did her no favors once again and I did feel like she was given like four or five pieces of direction to portray her character compared to the more one-note performance in the first film. Teyonah Parris is commendable. She was the more science-y of the trio.Samuel L. Jackson just feels inconsistent especially after SECRET INVASION. Feels like this Nick Fury is a variant. He's simply passing through in this film.Another thing I liked was the incursions (also briefly touched on in DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS). We all complained about the lack of planting seeds for the future leading into KANG DYNASTY and SECRET WARS. Finally, this film it at least preps and teases what's to come down the line.The MCU's villain problem is a long known fact, but here it only cements their problem even further. Now I'm a fan of Lee Pace's over the top performance as Ronan, but Dar-Benn played by Zawe Ashton is literally a copy and paste of Ronan, but female. Nothing new about it. Definitely up there as one of the worst villains in the MCU.The power swaps were kinda cool so I can give it that. Nia DaCosta does a good job executing the fight scenes, but again as one should expect, VFX is meh. Now if you cringed during the musical note duel between the two Doctor Strange, then wait till you see one segment of the film where it feels like a misplaced musical. Lots of quirky and annoying humor like one should expect in an MCU film.The Skrulls are in the film and as a fan we always think we can write the better film after watching it, but I just DO NOT understand why this sequel couldn't have been SECRET INVASION(one of the worst MCU Disney+ shows). SECRET INVASION honestly should have been an Avengers film or at the very least a Captain Marvel sequel co-starring some Avengers, kinda like CIVIL WAR. I personally feel like that dilemma could have furthered Captain Marvel's development due to her involvement with them and how she's equally to blame for not helping them out when she and Fury promised to find them a home. But instead she's stuck with this material.The mid-credit scene is arguably the best part. Once again teasing things to come. It's stuff that like that, that will maybe still garner interest in the MCU despite its current fall from grace. The end-credit scene is alright. Not particularly jazzed about that promise down the line.On that note, the recent Variety article published about Marvel Studios talked about their behind the scenes trouble. It was said that Kevin Feige and his creative committee partook in their yearly Palm Springs retreat to regroup and refocus, so here's hoping to next year being more consistent with quality. Seemed like he was spread too thin with the mandate to have more quantity than quality.THE MARVELS is a season 1.5 for MS. MARVEL and a CAPTAIN MARVEL sequel that we never saw due to the flashbacks and exposition to explain things. And let's be clear, at this point everything feels like homework. That was going to be inevitable moving forward after INFINITY WAR and ENDGAMGE, but especially when Disney+ was announced making Kevin Feige spread out too thin. But it only feels like homework because everything that has been released is below the standard of what Marvel set up for us.So to sum it up, while I did find it slightly more appealing than the first CAPTAIN MARVEL and QUANTUMANIA, that isn't saying much. Low expectations definitely helped. Is THE MARVELS one of the worst? No, but it definitely belongs way down below the list.5/10."
"Marvels","tibby_23","17 January 2024",410,"By far the worst Marvel movie so far, I am extremely disappointed.

I am honestly happy this movie did bad at the box office, that's what you get for ruining such a great character (I loved Cpt. Marvel from the comics).What makes it bad:
Action moves way too fast from one scene to anotherNo character improvement or growth by the end of the movieThings just happen with no storytellingNot serious enough, too childish for my tasteToo many goofy moments (singing, really? We've come this low, Marvel?)End scenes that try to set the context for next movies seem forced and unnecessaryI also found two good things eventually:
I liked the villain and her story, sympathized with her a bitAt least the movie was not long.These writers should never be hired again."
"Marvels","olcare","10 November 2023",410,"Criticizing specific parts of the movie became confusing for me as there were so many details I wanted to change. This film truly disappointed me, especially since my expectations were already low, and falling below them is a bad sign for Marvel. It had a Thor: Love and Thunder vibe, which I also disliked (4/10). I had been excited after watching Loki in the morning, but it was in vain.For me, the unbearable part was the music. After checking the playlists of movies I've watched for a long time, Marvel had by far the worst compositions. The music was exaggerated, drowning out the impact of fight scenes and making them unbearable. It was like overly noisy background music during a break.Another aspect I didn't like was the main villain. I can't believe Marvel fell into the same mistake again. The villain was poorly written, and Zawe Ashton's performance felt forced, appearing awkward in scenes. One major reason for this was the poor portrayal of the Kree Empire in the MCU. Neglecting the significance of the Kree made Supreme look bad. They could have explained the critical situation of the 'Hala' planet in the film's opening with a 30-35 minute sequence, providing context for the desperation of the Kree.Another thing I found absurd was Monica teleporting to a parallel universe. They portrayed the concept of parallel universes like child's play. Especially after watching Loki Season 2 in the morning, her randomly teleporting or getting stuck in another universe seemed too simplistic.Seeing Professor Beast was surprising and pleasing. The X-Men era is beginning, and despite the poor productions, I'm excited. Brie Larson was good again, carrying her character well. The scene with Monica, Kamala, Danvers vs Dar-Benn was good, thankfully without music. However, despite not being a fan of Kamala Khan, her origin is preserved, and it's not bad. But I feel there's a lack of harmony among our main three characters, and I believe it's a script issue, not an actor one.While I like the idea of saving a planet by traveling through different planets, I didn't like the execution at all. Presenting such a serious and contemporary issue as if it's the simplest thing with childlike music seems somewhat unserious to me.However it turns out, this film paved the way for others and served as a stepping stone. Hopefully, with Beast in Deadpool 3, the overall MCU storyline will improve, abandoning mediocrity urgently; otherwise, it will continue to receive poor ratings.Note: I forgot to mention in the review, but Goose is a fantastic character, and I hope we continue to see this adorable cat. The scene with all the cats was genuinely entertaining, one of the enjoyable moments in 4-5 scenes."
"Marvels","alensufli","8 November 2023",210,"Even writing a review is extremely pointless as we all knew what we were expecting months before but here I am. They even themselves admitted it. The film is a huge disappointment. The plot is all over the place. Actions sequences were sometimes good but sometime were so dumb I didn't know where to look, where to pay attention. I like how they tried to catch the old marvel magic. Yes. They tried. But they utterly failed. Feige pulled off ""wait until the post credit scene to get excited cuz the film itself is boring"" trick again. And it wasn't a ""wow"" for me at least. The theatre was silent throughout and after the film. No one even made a giggling sound. Dead silence. Jokes were landing facedown to the ground every time a character made one. That's right. Every character there is comic relief. And I absolutely don't wanna talk about acting."

Confusing.I had hoped that following Guardians 3 it could've get much worse for the Marvel universe, at least Guardians has Rocket😂It's hard to find any plot to this movie. Carol Danvers (Captain Marvel) does throw a lot of people through the roof but the plot is a quantum entanglement mess. The movie is blissfully short but feels longer as it's so bad and some people walked out of the theatre. I was so pleasantly when it ended.I think it's about to retire the whole Marvel superhero franchise as this phase is going badly."
"Marvels","nscoby93","10 November 2023",210,"I actually had no intention of watching this film in theaters. Originally, I was just going to wait for its home release on Disney Plus, but after recently rewatching WandaVision, I genuinely wanted to see how they would handle Monica Rambeau and see what they would do with her.So I'll mention the positives for this film first...The movie is actually pretty, I really enjoyed the film aesthetically it looked good. This is very surprising to say as recent Marvel projects are tremendous eye sores.The films central characters, Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) and Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani), were surprisingly good. I had fully anticipated to dislike Captain Marvel and Ms Marvel in this film but I surprisingly enjoyed them both which is a big compliment coming from me, and Monica Rambeau is my favorite of the three she was good as I expected and anticipated. All three actresses gave enjoyable performances, and they all worked well together on screen.Then, of course, Samuel Jackson is always great! And the return of everyone's favorite Flerken kitty Goose. She had a great sequence that I refuse to spoil, but it had me dying. Goose saved this film!And well that's it...This film is just bad. Bad writing, bad pacing, bad storytelling. Nothing in this film is properly set up as it rushes through its 1 hour and 45 minute run time. Which is quite frankly fine for me as I genuinely did not want more of this.This movie as a whole is just overwhelmingly safe. It has no stakes, takes no risks, and does nothing. But there is actual enjoyment in its failings. It was so bad that it was good. The amount of eye rolling, face palms, and sighs I gave through this film was astonishing. I gave up on this film within the first 30 minutes, and afterward, that's when the enjoyment began because of how bad it went on to be.Then suddenly, out of nowhere, the film became a musical? Like what is happening? This film is so chaotic and unstructured. It just never stopped.The film had a good mid-credit scene so you know stay for that. Unfortunately, it was spoiled for me, so it didn't hit as hard as it could have. Especially if you're a fan of the actor who originally played the character the scene introduces.But The Marvels was exactly what I anticipated it to be, a below average dump. Which is a shame because they play with some interesting concepts in this film, but they do nothing with them, or they are just poorly handled. I can at least say I didn't hate this movie. Unfortunately, I just enjoyed it for all the wrong reasons.IMDb: 3/10

"Marvels","brentsbulletinboard","11 November 2023",510,"When I first heard the title of this movie, I thought it was about a 1960s girls' singing group. And, frankly, that would have probably made for a better movie. Writer-director Nia DaCosta's third feature outing and the latest in the Marvel Universe paradigm is a wildly inconsistent superhero movie that tries too hard to do too much and doesn't have a script to support it. Too many of its plot elements aren't adequately explained until well into the story, while others aren't explained at all, leaving viewers who aren't comic book laureates wondering what's going on (particularly at film's end). Meanwhile, other narrative aspects frequently appear gimmicky and grow old quickly, such as the introduction of the primary superpower that its three protagonists share, one that almost becomes slapstickish after an all-too-brief while. On top of that, the CGI effects vacillate from one end of the quality spectrum to the other, creating a mix of images that are either startling to look at or stunningly cheesy at best. Add to that a villain that isn't particularly menacing, along with attempts at humor that either succeed brilliantly (cat lovers take note) or fall flat and look incredibly lame (as aficionados of musical theater will undoubtedly attest), all of which further add to the picture's pervasive inconsistency. The inclusion of ample clues for advancing the overarching Marvel Universe storyline continues here, too, furthering a trend that's growing tiresome in the studio's releases, a development akin to the ""Paul is dead"" legacy come to life with every passing picture. Then there's the trio of heroes themselves, who often appear more like they've been plucked from a giddy slumber party flick or a Cyndi Lauper video than taking center stage as seriously empowered champions in an action-adventure offering. All of these failings combine to make this production more of a forgettable placeholder in the Marvel mythology than a standalone feature (not to mention a pale substitute for a sequel to the far-superior film that launched the Captain Marvel franchise in 2019). In short, ""The Marvels"" is as much of a mess as it is a movie, and that's troubling for several reasons. It lends credence to the growing criticism that films like this aren't to be taken seriously. It reinforces the notion that they're cookie-cutter in nature, easily interchangeable with one another. And it raises questions about the career choices of lead actress Brie Larson, who, though quite capable of playing roles like these, is running the risk of becoming type-cast, a troubling prospect for an Academy Award-winning actress who possesses a depth of talent and is handily adept at taking on better and more serious material than this. In the wake of this release, Marvel Studios should take a step back and seriously assess where its future is headed, especially if movies like this are any indication. As pictures like ""Wakanda Forever"" (2022) show, the studio is capable of better work - and it's time to show viewers that."
"Marvels","Sleepin_Dragon","10 November 2023",410,"Carol Danvers is attempting to save the universe, but her incredible powers become entangled with those of Kamala Khan and Monica Rambeau, they must unite to save the world.Ouch, what can you say, this is surely one of Marvel's lowest points, I honestly don't know who the target audience is, or who this is going to appeal to, young teens only maybe? Anyhow, this was an absolute mess.The writing was clearly problematic, it doesn't gel, it is genuinely all over the place. I do very much wonder if huge sections of this film cut? It can be the only answer, it just doesn't flow at all, and that short run time...Special effects, some were pretty good, some were poor, I just wish there was a greater focus on plot, it just seemed like 100 minutes of CGI, noise and random events.Brie Larson, I'm not sure about you, but to me she looked totally disinterested and bored by the whole thing, what I didn't see, was someone committed to the role. I thought Samuel Jackson was rather good, but again poorly served by the script.It didn't look great from the trailers, and in reality, it's another clunker from Marvel Studios.4/10."
"Marvels","judywalker2","14 December 2023",510,"Went to see this movie with my 17- and 11-year-old granddaughters. One is a Ms. Marvel fan and the other is now. For me I was hoping for something that children and adults could enjoy. But, no only kids will enjoy this silly mess.I enjoyed the Captain Marvel movie and thought the criticism was not warranted. I also loved Wanda Vision and the introduction of Monica Rambeau and I was hoping for at least a good continuation of her story. I didn't watch Ms. Marvel because I'm not a teen and I knew it wasn't for me; and after watching her parts in this movie I'm glad I stuck to that.All three actresses are good and of course Samuel L in always a pleasure to see, but none of the other characters including the so-called villain were the least bit interesting. Most of the scenes were just downright silly. I hope they continue Monica's story with better writing and I wish Marvel would stop being silly and go back to making movies for adults and kids."
"Marvels","isaacsundaralingam","11 November 2023",310,"The MCU has absolutely overstayed its welcome. Post Avengers Endgame, these projects have been feeling more and more like content than cinema (except the rare surprises like GOTG 3). Superhero fatigue, they call it and this movie does practically nothing but to amp it up to 11.You watch the trailer, you know what happens. You bet on originality, you end up homeless. There's nothing new for me to say that I haven't already said about any of the other MCU content as of late. It's so generic that I'm confident a year from now, no one would remember this movie even existed. With every new MCU project, the jokes-per-minute ratio keeps getting worse, the villains are a writer's version of a stock photograph (I can't even remember the villain's name in this movie and it hasn't even been a day since I watched it), the CGI is so out there you can almost see the CGI artists' tears on screen, and it's getting more and more difficult to tell each MCU project apart cos they're all just the same.The only few positives I can identify here are actresses Iman Vellani and Brie Larson (Larson, who seems much more relaxed and settled into her superhero boots), and maybe the flashy action sequences. Otherwise, there's nothing here to watch, nothing here to experience and nothing here to enjoy. What a shame."
"Marvels","MrDHWong","9 November 2023",410,"""The Marvels"" is the sequel to 2019's ""Captain Marvel"", a continuation of the Disney+ series ""Ms. Marvel"", and the 33rd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris, and Iman Vellani, it represents a painful look at the downward spiral the MCU has found itself caught in since the end of Phase 3.Sometime after the events of ""Captain Marvel"", Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) has unintentionally started a civil war among the alien race known as the Kree. The leader of the Kree, Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton), soon finds one half of the Quantum Bands and later seeks out the other half, which is in the possession of Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel (Iman Vellani). At the request of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Carol teams up with Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) to negotiate peace among the Kree, but as the two investigate a wormhole in outer space, Monica, Carol, and Kamala start mysteriously switching powers with one another. Realising something is amiss, the trio are forced to work together to figure out what is causing this strange phenomena and hopefully put a stop to both Dar-Benn and the warring Kree.It's becoming harder and harder to call myself fan of the MCU, given the array of serviceable to terrible projects they have been churning out lately. To be fair though, it is a tall order to top something as ambitious as the culmination of over ten years worth of universe building after both ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and ""Avengers: Endgame"" pulled it off so effectively years ago. For the longest time, I have been willing to defend the post-Endgame MCU for trying different things, as I was under the impression that all of this would be leading to exciting new projects on the horizon. However, after sitting through ""The Marvels"", I can say with a hint of heartbreak that practically all of my optimism for the MCU's future has all but disappeared, as it contains next to nothing worth defending from a creative standpoint.Perhaps the best way to describe my viewing experience with this film would be ""apathetic"", because at no point does it ever feel like anything important is at stake. This is mainly due to either our three heroes being too overpowered or there not being enough information provided about the ones who need saving. Whenever a horde of enemies are swarming the trio, we watch as the three of them effortlessly take them out without even breaking a sweat. Action-packed moments like these that once elicited excitement have now been reduced to a series of bland fistfights and generic CGI blasts that have all been done before in better MCU films.We see Carol Danvers quickly blast everyone away with her energy beams and block punches with her hands, never once showing any signs that she is in real danger. Her accomplice Monica Rambeau does pretty much the same thing, only with less time on screen. Even Kamala Khan, who is the biggest fish-out-of-water in this situation, has no major trouble dealing with foes coming at her from every angle, always using her half of the Quantum Band to her advantage. How is it possible to keep the audience on their toes if the enemy forces are so inefficient that even an inexperienced child can wipe the floor with them this easily? On that note, it also doesn't help that none of these three heroes appear to have any physical weaknesses or personal insecurities holding them back, which causes all of the tension to evaporate instantly.In addition to this, we are barely shown anything interesting about the Kree that will keep the audience invested in their role in the story. As far as the film is concerned, they are nothing more than a stock species of extraterrestrials that are causing problems simply because the plot demands it. The original ""Captain Marvel"" film established that the Kree were the ones who inadvertently gave Carol her powers and took her in among them. Yet, this film never reminds the audience of that, instead opting to throw them right into the thick of the conflict without any important context. As a result, I just did not care at all about what happened to any of these people.It's also worth mentioning that this film is rife with obvious re-edits and tonal inconsistencies. One scene where this is most evident is where Carol Danvers is opening up to both Rambeau and Khan about her relationship with the Kree. What could have been a good method of showcasing Danvers's humanity is instead brushed aside for something completely unrelated after less than two minutes. I couldn't help but assume that this scene was supposed to go on much longer but was cut in post production for whatever reason. To add insult to injury, the scene is then immediately followed by a strange attempt at comic relief which fails to raise even a single laugh. Although Marvel films are known for their blending of comedy with drama, a moment like this felt like a rather tacky addition to the film that only hampers the already poor narrative structure. Worse still, there are other similar occurrences like this throughout the rest of the story.One of the biggest problems with the original ""Captain Marvel"" film was how weakly written the title character was, with her lack of likeable character traits and overly serious demeanour being a major reason why she is not viewed favourably by fans. You'd expect the filmmakers to remedy this problem for the sequel, but you would be wrong. I'm not sure whether it's Brie Larson's underwhelming performance or just plain old bad writing but I have never once felt any fondness for Carol Danvers as a person. As mentioned above, she efficiently fights her way through many bad guys with no issue whatsoever, never once showing any emotional weakness or other potential vulnerabilities. Because of this, Carol Danvers never feels like a real person, being nothing more than a one-dimensional superhero that is practically impossible for anybody to identify with. Her character has not changed or grown since the first film, and it looks like she won't be doing so anytime soon.I keep trying to remind myself of Monica Rambeau's contribution to the story but nothing memorable ever comes to mind without doing some kind of online research. Like Brie Larson, there is nothing especially remarkable about Teyonah Parris's performance, as her character is as bland as she comes. Though it is established that Rambeau looked up to Carol Danvers as a child, her role in this story is nothing more than playing second fiddle to an already dull lead protagonist. Yes, Rambeau is very strong and yes, she is more than capable of taking care of herself in a fight, but beyond that what else does she offer? Most of the time she just goes along with Danvers's orders without ever questioning her or giving her personal opinions, making her nothing more than a blind follower. I was hoping to have seen some kind of opposing dynamic between Danvers and Rambeau, as that would have given their characters an important amount of depth the distinguish the two from one another. No such luck I'm afraid.The only character I sort of cared about was Kamala Khan, whose childlike naiveté made her the most relatable of the three leads. In her feature film debut, Iman Vellani does carry over many of Khan's human traits from the Disney+ series ""Ms. Marvel"", being that she's still young and coming to terms with mastering her powers. Unfortunately, she does not achieve this through the character herself, but rather due to how woefully underwritten her two co-stars are in comparison. I wanted to see the three as kindred spirits, fighting as trio but standing out as individuals. Instead, all we get are two dull, stoic, overpowered adults and a young kid working together for no other reason than because the writers said so.As depressing as it sounds, the once mighty MCU is showing no signs of improvement as ""The Marvels"" just may be the worst film in the series so far. There simply isn't enough reason to justify its existence outside of some kind of contractual obligation by the higher ups at Disney, and I fully respect many people's decision to skip it altogether. At this point, I seriously doubt the MCU can ever return to its former glory, as this film is set to become the series' biggest box office bomb to date. I can only hope in vain that Disney will learn an important lesson from this film's failure, but knowing their track record that seems unlikely.I rate it 4/10."
"Marvels","danieljfarthing","9 January 2024",110,"2019's ""Captain Marvel"" wasn't too bad, for a superhero movie, but its sequel ""The Marvels"" is an unmitigated stinking disaster - the WORST Marvel movie to date (which is saying something). Set a decade or two after the original, Brie Larson (via Samuel L Jackson) teams somewhat inadvertently with Teyonah Parris & Iman Vellani (awful) to save Gary Lewis' people (what happened to previous leader Ben Mendelsohn?!) from evil Zawe Ashton.

"Marvels","ThereelscoopwithKK","10 November 2023",110,"This second installment makes the original Captain Marvel look like a cinematic masterpiece... Nothing about this movie works. Although Brie Larson's acting has improved over the years it feels like she doesn't want to be there for this at all. Further, when you break it down, there is really no story at all happening. In fact, the solution to the entire problem is so extremely simple and solvable that you really wonder why there was a conflict in the first place. So much of everything is unexplained and eventually you stop trying to figure it out because you eventually lose all interest . Samuel L Jackson's character , Nick Fury, is hardly even a shell of his former self and is essentially now demoted to comedic relief.The scenes don't really mesh together at all. None of them are really necessary to advancing a plot and all feature the same repeated choreographic battle. The villain lacks any real charisma and is only provided a very brief backstory. Overall she never feels like too much of a threat.There's one part in particular that I think is absolutely a candidate for worst sequence of 2023. Without spoiling it , it is essentially a planet that looks like a cheap rip off of the Wizard of Oz. It just captures all of the problems with this movie into one scene. There's been a lot of less than stellar work from Marvel since endgame, but this is reaching new depths.I'm not even going to get started on the cats scene with the theme song....Please Loki, reset the entire timeline."

So much potential squandered right before our very eyes.Much has been said about the Girl Power aspect of this story, but it doesn't mean jack when the characters are so thinly written. After the big character tension build up between Carol and Monica, with the latter resenting her for not coming back, their fractures mend themselves very quickly. There is no chemistry between the the two at all.The villain is Bland with a capitol B, and highly forgettable.Nick Fury is actually pathetic in this movie. He doesn't at all act like the Fury we know and love. He was more in character in Far From Home when Talos was impersonating him!I don't think I've ever had this much of a bad experience with a film since Cats. And it is telling that there actually features a ludicrous scene involving baby flerkens and the song Memory.What the actual hell, Marvel?The only good thing is that it is mercifully short, and Iman Vellani does seem to be enjoying herself in the role.Once a great studio, brought crumbling down on itself.

Director Nia DaCosta has made ""Little Woods"" which I liked but her direction here is pretty bad and goes all over the place.The special effects are kind of rough on the edges, the actions and thrills were just okay and the performances, despite a pretty good cast, they aren't very good. Brie Larson is an actress I like but unfortunately her performance felt weak and lacking. The other performances as well including the child performances.

"Marvels","kevin_robbins","12 November 2023",310,"My wife and I recently caught Marvel's (2023) in theaters. The plot revolves around Captain Marvel's mistake in choosing sides during a battle, disrupting the cosmic balance. Two young ladies gain powers in the process, and Captain Marvel must collaborate with them to rectify her error and restore equilibrium to the universe.Directed by Nia DaCosta (Candyman) and featuring Brie Larson (Lessons in Chemistry), Teyonah Parris (Dear White People), Iman Vellani (Ms. Marvel), Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction), and Zawe Ashton (Blitz).This film boasts clean and classic Marvel-style characters, cinematography, action scenes, and special effects. However, the plot seems somewhat lackluster, with Captain Marvel possibly appearing more as a villain than a hero. The backstories of the heroes lack sufficient development, making it challenging to form a connection with them. The cat steals the show initially but feels overdone by the end, and even Samuel L. Jackson's wit falls short of expectations.In summary, this superhero movie prioritizes its message over a compelling storyline. While the characters and visuals are in line with Marvel's trademark style, the plot may leave audiences indifferent. The lack of character depth and an engaging storyline earns this film a 3/10, making it a skip-worthy experience."

The script is awful and the story is super rushed and poorly executed, which both have an impact on how well the characters (and in-turn the actors) come-across on-screenThe action and humour are kind of alright, and the VFX are definitely better than anything we've seen in an MCU project since Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness (with the obvious exceptions of Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 and Loki Season 2), but that still doesn't exactly make it look greatThis movie is just painful to watch at points! Early on, it has some really fun moments, and felt like it could have actually been somewhat entertaining, but that feeling vanished as soon as it came.

"Marvels","OnlyAtJMart","12 November 2023",410,"Anyone who heard the news about this project knows that the production was a nightmare, and it shows in the final product here. It's like they couldn't figure out what direction to go, so they made 4 versions, and blended them together. Which would explain the high budget, the 5 delays, and the reshoots. Kamala's character was probably the best part of the movie. I promise you, the script did her no favors, but she stood out. Her acting was in line with her character. This was probably an exciting opportunity for her, and she wasn't going to let a bad script, and production problems stop her from giving a great effort. However, the story, the dialogue, the musical gimmick, the weak villain. It just didn't work. I don't think the blame lies solely with the actors, or even the director, who did lack the experience for helming a movie with a budget this size. I think Disney interfered heavily with the production, which almost always yields bad results. I think it was doomed to fail. They put so much pressure on this being successful, they forgot to make it coherent, unique, or interesting."

The Marvels follows the titular Marvels trying to stop an evil Kree with one disadvantage however, every time they use their powers, it's Freaky Friday.Maybe its because of the very troubled production but everything just feels like an amalgamation of three separate movies, its like a ADHD experience. The movie does NOT take itself seriously at all, and as a result, it makes me hard to care for literally everything! Its like a circus act masquerading as a movie, it doesn't work! There were moments where characters were in danger and they start joking about it every opportunity they get. To add insult to injury was the treatment of the character of Nick Fury, who feels like a completely different character altogether, cracking lame after lame jokes every single time! Special effects were decent, but considering the massive 271M+ budget I wished they could've at least cared about the plot and flesh out some if the characters and their motivations instead of relying on action scene after action scene, it gets tiring after a while you know?Brie Larson herself looks tired and forced in this movie, her character also being this girl-boss who can sweep through enemies in this movie, no weaknesses and no vulnerabilities. It all feels so one-dimensional, it tries to be like a 80s action star with the likes of Arnold and co. But fails because they lack charisma and charm. Because of this I found it impossible to relate to her in any sense of way. Monica Rambeau wasn't trying her best here, and there is no opposing dynamic between the two to the point where I found her virtually indistinguishable from Mrs. Danvers herself. However I do commend Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan, whose child-like personality I was comfortable with and is the standout between the three leads but suffers from being very underwritten and the villain is a copy-and-paste from dozens we've seen before.Overall, a messy and disjointed movie with not much to offer rather than annoying, dreadful humor and some few flashy action scenes. It certainly feels like homework for the MCU as it struggles to keep a hook in something after the Infinity Saga. Skip this one and play with your action figures instead, Im sure it'll be better than this."
"Marvels","critic-97-417657","4 February 2024",810,"The movie was somewhat ridiculous, but I found myself giggling throughout it. It was actually quite fun. There were a lot of really charming things about this movie, and while the storyline lacked any real tension, I didn't really care. It was mostly about the character development, and the relationships between the three main characters. Overall, I just found it really fun and just didn't take it very seriously. In a lot of ways, it is a set up for the rest of the series, and is definitely not a standalone movie. And the post credit scene, amazing. Ties in a lot of potential for what they are going to be doing in this franchise."
"Marvels","The-Sarkologist","7 February 2024",710,"Well, I guess someone was right when they said that one of the big problems with this film was that you had to like watch 8 other films and 3 series to sort of understand what was going on. Mind you, I have actually done just that, but even then with the amount of time that had passed since I watched the other things it was still a little tricky understanding what was happening.Mind you, I did actually quite like the film. Like the scenes where they were switching places whenever they used their powers together, and also the big bad in the film, that was in part trying to save her people, but also attempting to punish Captain Marvel for what she had done to her people. Yeah, as it turned out, when she destroyed the great intelligence it sent the Kree into a massive civil war which basically destroyed their planet.So, if you had seen Miss Marvel, you will know that she has a thing for Captain Marvel, and of course it was always going to be a thing that she was eventually going to be involved in a team up. Also, there were some hints at the end that suggested that there was going to be another team-up film, though apparently that will still be some way off (and the problem will be that, no doubt, when they get around to it, all of them will be too old to be members of a possible Young Avengers - kids do grow up a little too fast).Yeah, I thought that this film was pretty good, though I have to agree that the problem is that you do need to catch up to speed to understand what is going on. Oh, it also seemed that it felt that it was a bit over the place, no doubt because they wanted to make the film shorter than a lot of the others. Still, it's good, especially if you are up to date on the films."
"Marvels","cherold","30 January 2024",710,"After the bad reviews, and considering how many bad superhero movies have come out lately, I would have skipped this one if the trailer didn't look like so much fun. Fortunately, the movie fulfills the trailer's promiseIn the movie, three superheroes with related powers find themselves suddenly swapping places with one another. The proves to be a good gimmick for both action and comedy, as the three keep finding themselves in one another's battles. Eventually, they master the situation in order to take down a very angry villain with an unusually sympathetic backstory.The movie leans heavily - and for the most part successfully - into the comedy. A big chunk of this is fueled by the teenage Captain Marvel fangirl Ms. Marvel, who is from a TV series I found too pre-teen-oriented to enjoy. Ms. Marvel's an annoying character but for the most part I found her amusing in this.There's also a funny gag with alien cats.While I enjoyed this movie, I have to admit its a bit of an unfocussed mess. There are a lot of elements just tossed in, like a whole thing with Marvel #3, Monica, dealing with her abandonment issues. These occasional ""emotional"" moments don't much interest me.Anyway, a lot of people hate this, but if you like the trailer, I'd say chance the movie (I did not take a chance on the last Aquaman movie because unlike The Marvels, the trailer looked just as bad as people said the movie was.Going against the current, I say if you want a bunch of comedy and some fun action then you should watch this one."
"Marvels","drawlife","8 November 2023",510,"THE MARVELS is here and it's a mashed up film that is totally all over the place. It feels as if this film was edited and chopped into pieces during post and it shows.Couple things I enjoyed, I did like seeing Carol Danvers and Monica Rambeau resolve and acknowledge their relationship, but due to the nature of their characters being straight arrows, it allows Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan to be the audience just as Tom Holland's Peter Parker was in CIVIL WAR. I did not particularly enjoy the MS. MARVEL series, but I can see her being the shoutout for many.I think the script just touched on the surface of Brie Larson's Captain Marvel herself, so diving into her more is a plus, however the story did her no favors once again and I did feel like she was given like four or five pieces of direction to portray her character compared to the more one-note performance in the first film. Teyonah Parris is commendable. She was the more science-y of the trio.Samuel L. Jackson just feels inconsistent especially after SECRET INVASION. Feels like this Nick Fury is a variant. He's simply passing through in this film.Another thing I liked was the incursions (also briefly touched on in DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS). We all complained about the lack of planting seeds for the future leading into KANG DYNASTY and SECRET WARS. Finally, this film it at least preps and teases what's to come down the line.The MCU's villain problem is a long known fact, but here it only cements their problem even further. Now I'm a fan of Lee Pace's over the top performance as Ronan, but Dar-Benn played by Zawe Ashton is literally a copy and paste of Ronan, but female. Nothing new about it. Definitely up there as one of the worst villains in the MCU.The power swaps were kinda cool so I can give it that. Nia DaCosta does a good job executing the fight scenes, but again as one should expect, VFX is meh. Now if you cringed during the musical note duel between the two Doctor Strange, then wait till you see one segment of the film where it feels like a misplaced musical. Lots of quirky and annoying humor like one should expect in an MCU film.The Skrulls are in the film and as a fan we always think we can write the better film after watching it, but I just DO NOT understand why this sequel couldn't have been SECRET INVASION(one of the worst MCU Disney+ shows). SECRET INVASION honestly should have been an Avengers film or at the very least a Captain Marvel sequel co-starring some Avengers, kinda like CIVIL WAR. I personally feel like that dilemma could have furthered Captain Marvel's development due to her involvement with them and how she's equally to blame for not helping them out when she and Fury promised to find them a home. But instead she's stuck with this material.The mid-credit scene is arguably the best part. Once again teasing things to come. It's stuff that like that, that will maybe still garner interest in the MCU despite its current fall from grace. The end-credit scene is alright. Not particularly jazzed about that promise down the line.On that note, the recent Variety article published about Marvel Studios talked about their behind the scenes trouble. It was said that Kevin Feige and his creative committee partook in their yearly Palm Springs retreat to regroup and refocus, so here's hoping to next year being more consistent with quality. Seemed like he was spread too thin with the mandate to have more quantity than quality.THE MARVELS is a season 1.5 for MS. MARVEL and a CAPTAIN MARVEL sequel that we never saw due to the flashbacks and exposition to explain things. And let's be clear, at this point everything feels like homework. That was going to be inevitable moving forward after INFINITY WAR and ENDGAMGE, but especially when Disney+ was announced making Kevin Feige spread out too thin. But it only feels like homework because everything that has been released is below the standard of what Marvel set up for us.So to sum it up, while I did find it slightly more appealing than the first CAPTAIN MARVEL and QUANTUMANIA, that isn't saying much. Low expectations definitely helped. Is THE MARVELS one of the worst? No, but it definitely belongs way down below the list.5/10."
"Marvels","tibby_23","17 January 2024",410,"By far the worst Marvel movie so far, I am extremely disappointed. After the mess that Thor 4 was, I was hoping that Marvel learned its lesson, but it seems not. I am honestly happy this movie did bad at the box office, that's what you get for ruining such a great character (I loved Cpt. Marvel from the comics).What makes it bad:
Action moves way too fast from one scene to anotherNo character improvement or growth by the end of the movieThings just happen with no storytellingNot serious enough, too childish for my tasteToo many goofy moments (singing, really? We've come this low, Marvel?)End scenes that try to set the context for next movies seem forced and unnecessaryI also found two good things eventually:
I liked the villain and her story, sympathized with her a bitAt least the movie was not long.These writers should never be hired again."
"Marvels","olcare","10 November 2023",410,"Criticizing specific parts of the movie became confusing for me as there were so many details I wanted to change. This film truly disappointed me, especially since my expectations were already low, and falling below them is a bad sign for Marvel. It had a Thor: Love and Thunder vibe, which I also disliked (4/10). I had been excited after watching Loki in the morning, but it was in vain.For me, the unbearable part was the music. After checking the playlists of movies I've watched for a long time, Marvel had by far the worst compositions. The music was exaggerated, drowning out the impact of fight scenes and making them unbearable. It was like overly noisy background music during a break.Another aspect I didn't like was the main villain. I can't believe Marvel fell into the same mistake again. The villain was poorly written, and Zawe Ashton's performance felt forced, appearing awkward in scenes. One major reason for this was the poor portrayal of the Kree Empire in the MCU. Neglecting the significance of the Kree made Supreme look bad. They could have explained the critical situation of the 'Hala' planet in the film's opening with a 30-35 minute sequence, providing context for the desperation of the Kree.Another thing I found absurd was Monica teleporting to a parallel universe. They portrayed the concept of parallel universes like child's play. Especially after watching Loki Season 2 in the morning, her randomly teleporting or getting stuck in another universe seemed too simplistic.Seeing Professor Beast was surprising and pleasing. The X-Men era is beginning, and despite the poor productions, I'm excited. Brie Larson was good again, carrying her character well. The scene with Monica, Kamala, Danvers vs Dar-Benn was good, thankfully without music. However, despite not being a fan of Kamala Khan, her origin is preserved, and it's not bad. But I feel there's a lack of harmony among our main three characters, and I believe it's a script issue, not an actor one.While I like the idea of saving a planet by traveling through different planets, I didn't like the execution at all. Presenting such a serious and contemporary issue as if it's the simplest thing with childlike music seems somewhat unserious to me.However it turns out, this film paved the way for others and served as a stepping stone. Hopefully, with Beast in Deadpool 3, the overall MCU storyline will improve, abandoning mediocrity urgently; otherwise, it will continue to receive poor ratings.Note: I forgot to mention in the review, but Goose is a fantastic character, and I hope we continue to see this adorable cat. The scene with all the cats was genuinely entertaining, one of the enjoyable moments in 4-5 scenes."
"Marvels","alensufli","8 November 2023",210,"Even writing a review is extremely pointless as we all knew what we were expecting months before but here I am. They even themselves admitted it. The film is a huge disappointment. The plot is all over the place. Actions sequences were sometimes good but sometime were so dumb I didn't know where to look, where to pay attention. I like how they tried to catch the old marvel magic. Yes. They tried. But they utterly failed. Feige pulled off ""wait until the post credit scene to get excited cuz the film itself is boring"" trick again. And it wasn't a ""wow"" for me at least. The theatre was silent throughout and after the film. No one even made a giggling sound. Dead silence. Jokes were landing facedown to the ground every time a character made one. That's right. Every character there is comic relief. And I absolutely don't wanna talk about acting."
"Marvels","S3pt3m63r","18 November 2023",NA,"Unfortunately if you haven't got Disney plus and you don't keep to speed with the tv series, then you this movie won't make much sense as it relies on you knowing what's going on in that universe so far, which I'm not up to date with and involves the Miss Marvels characters which haven't been introduced in the movies. Confusing.I had hoped that following Guardians 3 it could've get much worse for the Marvel universe, at least Guardians has Rocket😂It's hard to find any plot to this movie. Carol Danvers (Captain Marvel) does throw a lot of people through the roof but the plot is a quantum entanglement mess. The movie is blissfully short but feels longer as it's so bad and some people walked out of the theatre. I was so pleasantly when it ended.I think it's about to retire the whole Marvel superhero franchise as this phase is going badly."
"Marvels","nscoby93","10 November 2023",210,"I actually had no intention of watching this film in theaters. Originally, I was just going to wait for its home release on Disney Plus, but after recently rewatching WandaVision, I genuinely wanted to see how they would handle Monica Rambeau and see what they would do with her.So I'll mention the positives for this film first...The movie is actually pretty, I really enjoyed the film aesthetically it looked good. This is very surprising to say as recent Marvel projects are tremendous eye sores.The films central characters, Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) and Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani), were surprisingly good. I had fully anticipated to dislike Captain Marvel and Ms Marvel in this film but I surprisingly enjoyed them both which is a big compliment coming from me, and Monica Rambeau is my favorite of the three she was good as I expected and anticipated. All three actresses gave enjoyable performances, and they all worked well together on screen.Then, of course, Samuel Jackson is always great! And the return of everyone's favorite Flerken kitty Goose. She had a great sequence that I refuse to spoil, but it had me dying. Goose saved this film!And well that's it...This film is just bad. Bad writing, bad pacing, bad storytelling. Nothing in this film is properly set up as it rushes through its 1 hour and 45 minute run time. Which is quite frankly fine for me as I genuinely did not want more of this.This movie as a whole is just overwhelmingly safe. It has no stakes, takes no risks, and does nothing. But there is actual enjoyment in its failings. It was so bad that it was good. The amount of eye rolling, face palms, and sighs I gave through this film was astonishing. I gave up on this film within the first 30 minutes, and afterward, that's when the enjoyment began because of how bad it went on to be.Then suddenly, out of nowhere, the film became a musical? Like what is happening? This film is so chaotic and unstructured. It just never stopped.The film had a good mid-credit scene so you know stay for that. Unfortunately, it was spoiled for me, so it didn't hit as hard as it could have. Especially if you're a fan of the actor who originally played the character the scene introduces.But The Marvels was exactly what I anticipated it to be, a below average dump. Which is a shame because they play with some interesting concepts in this film, but they do nothing with them, or they are just poorly handled. I can at least say I didn't hate this movie. Unfortunately, I just enjoyed it for all the wrong reasons.IMDb: 3/10
Letterboxd: 2/5Watched in Theaters."

Once you get over its not adding anything or revealing any easter eggs, you can enjoy it for what it is.All three main characters deliver on their role, and it improves on captain marvels solo outing. Sit down take any preconceived ideas you have, remove any anticipation of easter eggs and enjoy it for what it is.Has marvel lost its way, yes.

"Marvels","brentsbulletinboard","11 November 2023",510,"When I first heard the title of this movie, I thought it was about a 1960s girls' singing group. And, frankly, that would have probably made for a better movie. Writer-director Nia DaCosta's third feature outing and the latest in the Marvel Universe paradigm is a wildly inconsistent superhero movie that tries too hard to do too much and doesn't have a script to support it. Too many of its plot elements aren't adequately explained until well into the story, while others aren't explained at all, leaving viewers who aren't comic book laureates wondering what's going on (particularly at film's end). Meanwhile, other narrative aspects frequently appear gimmicky and grow old quickly, such as the introduction of the primary superpower that its three protagonists share, one that almost becomes slapstickish after an all-too-brief while. On top of that, the CGI effects vacillate from one end of the quality spectrum to the other, creating a mix of images that are either startling to look at or stunningly cheesy at best. Add to that a villain that isn't particularly menacing, along with attempts at humor that either succeed brilliantly (cat lovers take note) or fall flat and look incredibly lame (as aficionados of musical theater will undoubtedly attest), all of which further add to the picture's pervasive inconsistency. The inclusion of ample clues for advancing the overarching Marvel Universe storyline continues here, too, furthering a trend that's growing tiresome in the studio's releases, a development akin to the ""Paul is dead"" legacy come to life with every passing picture. Then there's the trio of heroes themselves, who often appear more like they've been plucked from a giddy slumber party flick or a Cyndi Lauper video than taking center stage as seriously empowered champions in an action-adventure offering. All of these failings combine to make this production more of a forgettable placeholder in the Marvel mythology than a standalone feature (not to mention a pale substitute for a sequel to the far-superior film that launched the Captain Marvel franchise in 2019). In short, ""The Marvels"" is as much of a mess as it is a movie, and that's troubling for several reasons. It lends credence to the growing criticism that films like this aren't to be taken seriously. It reinforces the notion that they're cookie-cutter in nature, easily interchangeable with one another. And it raises questions about the career choices of lead actress Brie Larson, who, though quite capable of playing roles like these, is running the risk of becoming type-cast, a troubling prospect for an Academy Award-winning actress who possesses a depth of talent and is handily adept at taking on better and more serious material than this. In the wake of this release, Marvel Studios should take a step back and seriously assess where its future is headed, especially if movies like this are any indication. As pictures like ""Wakanda Forever"" (2022) show, the studio is capable of better work - and it's time to show viewers that."
"Marvels","Sleepin_Dragon","10 November 2023",410,"Carol Danvers is attempting to save the universe, but her incredible powers become entangled with those of Kamala Khan and Monica Rambeau, they must unite to save the world.Ouch, what can you say, this is surely one of Marvel's lowest points, I honestly don't know who the target audience is, or who this is going to appeal to, young teens only maybe? Anyhow, this was an absolute mess.The writing was clearly problematic, it doesn't gel, it is genuinely all over the place. I do very much wonder if huge sections of this film cut? It can be the only answer, it just doesn't flow at all, and that short run time...Special effects, some were pretty good, some were poor, I just wish there was a greater focus on plot, it just seemed like 100 minutes of CGI, noise and random events.Brie Larson, I'm not sure about you, but to me she looked totally disinterested and bored by the whole thing, what I didn't see, was someone committed to the role. I thought Samuel Jackson was rather good, but again poorly served by the script.It didn't look great from the trailers, and in reality, it's another clunker from Marvel Studios.4/10."
"Marvels","judywalker2","14 December 2023",510,"Went to see this movie with my 17- and 11-year-old granddaughters. One is a Ms. Marvel fan and the other is now.

I also loved Wanda Vision and the introduction of Monica Rambeau and I was hoping for at least a good continuation of her story. I didn't watch Ms. Marvel because I'm not a teen and I knew it wasn't for me; and after watching her parts in this movie I'm glad I stuck to that.All three actresses are good and of course Samuel L in always a pleasure to see, but none of the other characters including the so-called villain were the least bit interesting. Most of the scenes were just downright silly. I hope they continue Monica's story with better writing and I wish Marvel would stop being silly and go back to making movies for adults and kids."
"Marvels","isaacsundaralingam","11 November 2023",310,"The MCU has absolutely overstayed its welcome. Post Avengers Endgame, these projects have been feeling more and more like content than cinema (except the rare surprises like GOTG 3). Superhero fatigue, they call it and this movie does practically nothing but to amp it up to 11.You watch the trailer, you know what happens. You bet on originality, you end up homeless. There's nothing new for me to say that I haven't already said about any of the other MCU content as of late. It's so generic that I'm confident a year from now, no one would remember this movie even existed. With every new MCU project, the jokes-per-minute ratio keeps getting worse, the villains are a writer's version of a stock photograph (I can't even remember the villain's name in this movie and it hasn't even been a day since I watched it), the CGI is so out there you can almost see the CGI artists' tears on screen, and it's getting more and more difficult to tell each MCU project apart cos they're all just the same.The only few positives I can identify here are actresses Iman Vellani and Brie Larson (Larson, who seems much more relaxed and settled into her superhero boots), and maybe the flashy action sequences. Otherwise, there's nothing here to watch, nothing here to experience and nothing here to enjoy. What a shame."
"Marvels","MrDHWong","9 November 2023",410,"""The Marvels"" is the sequel to 2019's ""Captain Marvel"", a continuation of the Disney+ series ""Ms. Marvel"", and the 33rd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris, and Iman Vellani, it represents a painful look at the downward spiral the MCU has found itself caught in since the end of Phase 3.Sometime after the events of ""Captain Marvel"", Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) has unintentionally started a civil war among the alien race known as the Kree. The leader of the Kree, Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton), soon finds one half of the Quantum Bands and later seeks out the other half, which is in the possession of Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel (Iman Vellani). At the request of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Carol teams up with Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) to negotiate peace among the Kree, but as the two investigate a wormhole in outer space, Monica, Carol, and Kamala start mysteriously switching powers with one another. Realising something is amiss, the trio are forced to work together to figure out what is causing this strange phenomena and hopefully put a stop to both Dar-Benn and the warring Kree.It's becoming harder and harder to call myself fan of the MCU, given the array of serviceable to terrible projects they have been churning out lately. To be fair though, it is a tall order to top something as ambitious as the culmination of over ten years worth of universe building after both ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and ""Avengers: Endgame"" pulled it off so effectively years ago. For the longest time, I have been willing to defend the post-Endgame MCU for trying different things, as I was under the impression that all of this would be leading to exciting new projects on the horizon. However, after sitting through ""The Marvels"", I can say with a hint of heartbreak that practically all of my optimism for the MCU's future has all but disappeared, as it contains next to nothing worth defending from a creative standpoint.Perhaps the best way to describe my viewing experience with this film would be ""apathetic"", because at no point does it ever feel like anything important is at stake. This is mainly due to either our three heroes being too overpowered or there not being enough information provided about the ones who need saving. Whenever a horde of enemies are swarming the trio, we watch as the three of them effortlessly take them out without even breaking a sweat. Action-packed moments like these that once elicited excitement have now been reduced to a series of bland fistfights and generic CGI blasts that have all been done before in better MCU films.We see Carol Danvers quickly blast everyone away with her energy beams and block punches with her hands, never once showing any signs that she is in real danger. Her accomplice Monica Rambeau does pretty much the same thing, only with less time on screen. Even Kamala Khan, who is the biggest fish-out-of-water in this situation, has no major trouble dealing with foes coming at her from every angle, always using her half of the Quantum Band to her advantage. How is it possible to keep the audience on their toes if the enemy forces are so inefficient that even an inexperienced child can wipe the floor with them this easily? On that note, it also doesn't help that none of these three heroes appear to have any physical weaknesses or personal insecurities holding them back, which causes all of the tension to evaporate instantly.In addition to this, we are barely shown anything interesting about the Kree that will keep the audience invested in their role in the story. As far as the film is concerned, they are nothing more than a stock species of extraterrestrials that are causing problems simply because the plot demands it. The original ""Captain Marvel"" film established that the Kree were the ones who inadvertently gave Carol her powers and took her in among them. Yet, this film never reminds the audience of that, instead opting to throw them right into the thick of the conflict without any important context. As a result, I just did not care at all about what happened to any of these people.It's also worth mentioning that this film is rife with obvious re-edits and tonal inconsistencies. One scene where this is most evident is where Carol Danvers is opening up to both Rambeau and Khan about her relationship with the Kree. What could have been a good method of showcasing Danvers's humanity is instead brushed aside for something completely unrelated after less than two minutes. I couldn't help but assume that this scene was supposed to go on much longer but was cut in post production for whatever reason. To add insult to injury, the scene is then immediately followed by a strange attempt at comic relief which fails to raise even a single laugh. Although Marvel films are known for their blending of comedy with drama, a moment like this felt like a rather tacky addition to the film that only hampers the already poor narrative structure. Worse still, there are other similar occurrences like this throughout the rest of the story.One of the biggest problems with the original ""Captain Marvel"" film was how weakly written the title character was, with her lack of likeable character traits and overly serious demeanour being a major reason why she is not viewed favourably by fans. You'd expect the filmmakers to remedy this problem for the sequel, but you would be wrong. I'm not sure whether it's Brie Larson's underwhelming performance or just plain old bad writing but I have never once felt any fondness for Carol Danvers as a person. As mentioned above, she efficiently fights her way through many bad guys with no issue whatsoever, never once showing any emotional weakness or other potential vulnerabilities. Because of this, Carol Danvers never feels like a real person, being nothing more than a one-dimensional superhero that is practically impossible for anybody to identify with. Her character has not changed or grown since the first film, and it looks like she won't be doing so anytime soon.I keep trying to remind myself of Monica Rambeau's contribution to the story but nothing memorable ever comes to mind without doing some kind of online research. Like Brie Larson, there is nothing especially remarkable about Teyonah Parris's performance, as her character is as bland as she comes. Though it is established that Rambeau looked up to Carol Danvers as a child, her role in this story is nothing more than playing second fiddle to an already dull lead protagonist. Yes, Rambeau is very strong and yes, she is more than capable of taking care of herself in a fight, but beyond that what else does she offer? Most of the time she just goes along with Danvers's orders without ever questioning her or giving her personal opinions, making her nothing more than a blind follower. I was hoping to have seen some kind of opposing dynamic between Danvers and Rambeau, as that would have given their characters an important amount of depth the distinguish the two from one another. No such luck I'm afraid.The only character I sort of cared about was Kamala Khan, whose childlike naiveté made her the most relatable of the three leads. In her feature film debut, Iman Vellani does carry over many of Khan's human traits from the Disney+ series ""Ms. Marvel"", being that she's still young and coming to terms with mastering her powers. Unfortunately, she does not achieve this through the character herself, but rather due to how woefully underwritten her two co-stars are in comparison. I wanted to see the three as kindred spirits, fighting as trio but standing out as individuals. Instead, all we get are two dull, stoic, overpowered adults and a young kid working together for no other reason than because the writers said so.As depressing as it sounds, the once mighty MCU is showing no signs of improvement as ""The Marvels"" just may be the worst film in the series so far. There simply isn't enough reason to justify its existence outside of some kind of contractual obligation by the higher ups at Disney, and I fully respect many people's decision to skip it altogether. At this point, I seriously doubt the MCU can ever return to its former glory, as this film is set to become the series' biggest box office bomb to date. I can only hope in vain that Disney will learn an important lesson from this film's failure, but knowing their track record that seems unlikely.I rate it 4/10."

Marvel did a fantastic job over the decade, earned trust of fans besides billions of dollars and they are wasting it like there is no tomorrow.I don't know how a franchise can change so drastically from hero to zero.I have watched every marvel movie out there and this is equally as bad as she-hulk.Story is definitely boring, protagonists are boring, antagonist is boring, action is boring, battles are boring, some scenes are absurd and ridiculous.I have absolutely nothing good to say about this movie. Don't waste your money or your time.Looks like the movie is only made to make money in India."
"Marvels","ThereelscoopwithKK","10 November 2023",110,"This second installment makes the original Captain Marvel look like a cinematic masterpiece... Nothing about this movie works. Although Brie Larson's acting has improved over the years it feels like she doesn't want to be there for this at all. Further, when you break it down, there is really no story at all happening. In fact, the solution to the entire problem is so extremely simple and solvable that you really wonder why there was a conflict in the first place. So much of everything is unexplained and eventually you stop trying to figure it out because you eventually lose all interest . Samuel L Jackson's character , Nick Fury, is hardly even a shell of his former self and is essentially now demoted to comedic relief.The scenes don't really mesh together at all. None of them are really necessary to advancing a plot and all feature the same repeated choreographic battle. The villain lacks any real charisma and is only provided a very brief backstory. Overall she never feels like too much of a threat.There's one part in particular that I think is absolutely a candidate for worst sequence of 2023. Without spoiling it , it is essentially a planet that looks like a cheap rip off of the Wizard of Oz. It just captures all of the problems with this movie into one scene. There's been a lot of less than stellar work from Marvel since endgame, but this is reaching new depths.I'm not even going to get started on the cats scene with the theme song....Please Loki, reset the entire timeline."
"Marvels","Avwillfan89","23 December 2023",110,"This film is somehow way more depressing and worse than Ant Man Quantumania. We honestly thought Eternals was bad, but that was only the beginning. It was only going to go downhill from there.Watching this movie felt like watching a beloved friend in a coma fighting for her life. It was sad, frustrating and ultimately hopeless. So much potential squandered right before our very eyes.Much has been said about the Girl Power aspect of this story, but it doesn't mean jack when the characters are so thinly written. After the big character tension build up between Carol and Monica, with the latter resenting her for not coming back, their fractures mend themselves very quickly. There is no chemistry between the the two at all.The villain is Bland with a capitol B, and highly forgettable.Nick Fury is actually pathetic in this movie. He doesn't at all act like the Fury we know and love. He was more in character in Far From Home when Talos was impersonating him!I don't think I've ever had this much of a bad experience with a film since Cats. And it is telling that there actually features a ludicrous scene involving baby flerkens and the song Memory.What the actual hell, Marvel?The only good thing is that it is mercifully short, and Iman Vellani does seem to be enjoying herself in the role.Once a great studio, brought crumbling down on itself. If I could give it zero stars, I would."
"Marvels","chenp-54708","10 November 2023",210,"Marvel movies really have fallen apart haven't they? This is definitely one of the worst Marvels movie I have seen out of all the Marvel movies I had watched. There really isn't too much to say about the movie because ""The Marvels"" is pretty much like almost every single Marvel movie but the writing, humor, direction, and performances are pretty much all over the place. Director Nia DaCosta has made ""Little Woods"" which I liked but her direction here is pretty bad and goes all over the place.The special effects are kind of rough on the edges, the actions and thrills were just okay and the performances, despite a pretty good cast, they aren't very good. Brie Larson is an actress I like but unfortunately her performance felt weak and lacking. The other performances as well including the child performances. The story isn't interesting as the writing is pretty bland and none of the characters were interesting. With a short runtime, the movie surprisingly was really boring.I do like superhero movies but it seems this one really just sucked. Overall, it's bad."
"Marvels","kevin_robbins","12 November 2023",310,"My wife and I recently caught Marvel's (2023) in theaters. The plot revolves around Captain Marvel's mistake in choosing sides during a battle, disrupting the cosmic balance. Two young ladies gain powers in the process, and Captain Marvel must collaborate with them to rectify her error and restore equilibrium to the universe.Directed by Nia DaCosta (Candyman) and featuring Brie Larson (Lessons in Chemistry), Teyonah Parris (Dear White People), Iman Vellani (Ms. Marvel), Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction), and Zawe Ashton (Blitz).This film boasts clean and classic Marvel-style characters, cinematography, action scenes, and special effects. However, the plot seems somewhat lackluster, with Captain Marvel possibly appearing more as a villain than a hero. The backstories of the heroes lack sufficient development, making it challenging to form a connection with them. The cat steals the show initially but feels overdone by the end, and even Samuel L. Jackson's wit falls short of expectations.In summary, this superhero movie prioritizes its message over a compelling storyline. While the characters and visuals are in line with Marvel's trademark style, the plot may leave audiences indifferent. The lack of character depth and an engaging storyline earns this film a 3/10, making it a skip-worthy experience."
"Marvels","SHU_Movies","10 November 2023",310,"Going from the Loki Series Finale this morning to The Marvels this evening was (for lack of a better word) bonkers! The finale was perfect, and a beautiful ending to the show, while The Marvels is a complete mess. It's honestly given me whiplashThe Marvels is just an all-around bad movie. The script is awful and the story is super rushed and poorly executed, which both have an impact on how well the characters (and in-turn the actors) come-across on-screenThe action and humour are kind of alright, and the VFX are definitely better than anything we've seen in an MCU project since Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness (with the obvious exceptions of Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 and Loki Season 2), but that still doesn't exactly make it look greatThis movie is just painful to watch at points! Early on, it has some really fun moments, and felt like it could have actually been somewhat entertaining, but that feeling vanished as soon as it came. It's barley better than Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania, so you can do with that information what you will."
"Marvels","NanoFrog","16 January 2024",110,"So Stan Lee passes away and we get Disney now in full control of Marvel stories...and boy is there a difference. I could not finish watching this really bad film, it is just junk from scene to scene. The cast, I feel so sorry for them because the cast is a fine group for the most part...but the story, the effects, the directing are all jumbled up into a real mess. The premise is interesting but they have no idea what to do with it. I have never been a fan of Disney, maybe when I was 10 years old, back in the early 60s, but this is not at all Walt Disney. This is Disney INC and a massive number of talentless paperwork and book-keepers make their films these days. This is just junk slammed together by people who have no idea how to tell a story or stage intelligent effects. This film is not a Turkey, it is, in fact, just garbage. RIP MArvel."
"Marvels","OnlyAtJMart","12 November 2023",410,"Anyone who heard the news about this project knows that the production was a nightmare, and it shows in the final product here. It's like they couldn't figure out what direction to go, so they made 4 versions, and blended them together. Which would explain the high budget, the 5 delays, and the reshoots. Kamala's character was probably the best part of the movie. I promise you, the script did her no favors, but she stood out. Her acting was in line with her character. This was probably an exciting opportunity for her, and she wasn't going to let a bad script, and production problems stop her from giving a great effort. However, the story, the dialogue, the musical gimmick, the weak villain. It just didn't work. I don't think the blame lies solely with the actors, or even the director, who did lack the experience for helming a movie with a budget this size. I think Disney interfered heavily with the production, which almost always yields bad results. I think it was doomed to fail. They put so much pressure on this being successful, they forgot to make it coherent, unique, or interesting."
"Marvels","mildlyintrusive","13 November 2023",210,"Once in a while I tend to go to my local theater to check out something new, maybe a new release or a re-run of a movie. Today, I stumbled upon The Marvels, I thought ""Hey, I haven't been going to the theater this month that often, maybe I should try this out?"" And well, it seems that I'd made the wrong decision. The Marvels follows the titular Marvels trying to stop an evil Kree with one disadvantage however, every time they use their powers, it's Freaky Friday.Maybe its because of the very troubled production but everything just feels like an amalgamation of three separate movies, its like a ADHD experience. The movie does NOT take itself seriously at all, and as a result, it makes me hard to care for literally everything! Its like a circus act masquerading as a movie, it doesn't work! There were moments where characters were in danger and they start joking about it every opportunity they get. To add insult to injury was the treatment of the character of Nick Fury, who feels like a completely different character altogether, cracking lame after lame jokes every single time! Special effects were decent, but considering the massive 271M+ budget I wished they could've at least cared about the plot and flesh out some if the characters and their motivations instead of relying on action scene after action scene, it gets tiring after a while you know?Brie Larson herself looks tired and forced in this movie, her character also being this girl-boss who can sweep through enemies in this movie, no weaknesses and no vulnerabilities. It all feels so one-dimensional, it tries to be like a 80s action star with the likes of Arnold and co. But fails because they lack charisma and charm. Because of this I found it impossible to relate to her in any sense of way. Monica Rambeau wasn't trying her best here, and there is no opposing dynamic between the two to the point where I found her virtually indistinguishable from Mrs. Danvers herself. However I do commend Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan, whose child-like personality I was comfortable with and is the standout between the three leads but suffers from being very underwritten and the villain is a copy-and-paste from dozens we've seen before.Overall, a messy and disjointed movie with not much to offer rather than annoying, dreadful humor and some few flashy action scenes. It certainly feels like homework for the MCU as it struggles to keep a hook in something after the Infinity Saga. Skip this one and play with your action figures instead, Im sure it'll be better than this."
"Marvels","critic-97-417657","4 February 2024",810,"The movie was somewhat ridiculous, but I found myself giggling throughout it. It was actually quite fun. There were a lot of really charming things about this movie, and while the storyline lacked any real tension, I didn't really care. It was mostly about the character development, and the relationships between the three main characters. Overall, I just found it really fun and just didn't take it very seriously. In a lot of ways, it is a set up for the rest of the series, and is definitely not a standalone movie. And the post credit scene, amazing. Ties in a lot of potential for what they are going to be doing in this franchise."
"Marvels","The-Sarkologist","7 February 2024",710,"Well, I guess someone was right when they said that one of the big problems with this film was that you had to like watch 8 other films and 3 series to sort of understand what was going on. Mind you, I have actually done just that, but even then with the amount of time that had passed since I watched the other things it was still a little tricky understanding what was happening.Mind you, I did actually quite like the film. Like the scenes where they were switching places whenever they used their powers together, and also the big bad in the film, that was in part trying to save her people, but also attempting to punish Captain Marvel for what she had done to her people. Yeah, as it turned out, when she destroyed the great intelligence it sent the Kree into a massive civil war which basically destroyed their planet.So, if you had seen Miss Marvel, you will know that she has a thing for Captain Marvel, and of course it was always going to be a thing that she was eventually going to be involved in a team up. Also, there were some hints at the end that suggested that there was going to be another team-up film, though apparently that will still be some way off (and the problem will be that, no doubt, when they get around to it, all of them will be too old to be members of a possible Young Avengers - kids do grow up a little too fast).Yeah, I thought that this film was pretty good, though I have to agree that the problem is that you do need to catch up to speed to understand what is going on. Oh, it also seemed that it felt that it was a bit over the place, no doubt because they wanted to make the film shorter than a lot of the others. Still, it's good, especially if you are up to date on the films."
"Marvels","cherold","30 January 2024",710,"After the bad reviews, and considering how many bad superhero movies have come out lately, I would have skipped this one if the trailer didn't look like so much fun. Fortunately, the movie fulfills the trailer's promiseIn the movie, three superheroes with related powers find themselves suddenly swapping places with one another. The proves to be a good gimmick for both action and comedy, as the three keep finding themselves in one another's battles. Eventually, they master the situation in order to take down a very angry villain with an unusually sympathetic backstory.The movie leans heavily - and for the most part successfully - into the comedy. A big chunk of this is fueled by the teenage Captain Marvel fangirl Ms. Marvel, who is from a TV series I found too pre-teen-oriented to enjoy. Ms. Marvel's an annoying character but for the most part I found her amusing in this.There's also a funny gag with alien cats.While I enjoyed this movie, I have to admit its a bit of an unfocussed mess. There are a lot of elements just tossed in, like a whole thing with Marvel #3, Monica, dealing with her abandonment issues. These occasional ""emotional"" moments don't much interest me.Anyway, a lot of people hate this, but if you like the trailer, I'd say chance the movie (I did not take a chance on the last Aquaman movie because unlike The Marvels, the trailer looked just as bad as people said the movie was.Going against the current, I say if you want a bunch of comedy and some fun action then you should watch this one."
"Marvels","drawlife","8 November 2023",510,"THE MARVELS is here and it's a mashed up film that is totally all over the place. It feels as if this film was edited and chopped into pieces during post and it shows.Couple things I enjoyed, I did like seeing Carol Danvers and Monica Rambeau resolve and acknowledge their relationship, but due to the nature of their characters being straight arrows, it allows Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan to be the audience just as Tom Holland's Peter Parker was in CIVIL WAR. I did not particularly enjoy the MS. MARVEL series, but I can see her being the shoutout for many.I think the script just touched on the surface of Brie Larson's Captain Marvel herself, so diving into her more is a plus, however the story did her no favors once again and I did feel like she was given like four or five pieces of direction to portray her character compared to the more one-note performance in the first film. Teyonah Parris is commendable. She was the more science-y of the trio.Samuel L. Jackson just feels inconsistent especially after SECRET INVASION. Feels like this Nick Fury is a variant. He's simply passing through in this film.Another thing I liked was the incursions (also briefly touched on in DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS). We all complained about the lack of planting seeds for the future leading into KANG DYNASTY and SECRET WARS. Finally, this film it at least preps and teases what's to come down the line.The MCU's villain problem is a long known fact, but here it only cements their problem even further. Now I'm a fan of Lee Pace's over the top performance as Ronan, but Dar-Benn played by Zawe Ashton is literally a copy and paste of Ronan, but female. Nothing new about it. Definitely up there as one of the worst villains in the MCU.The power swaps were kinda cool so I can give it that. Nia DaCosta does a good job executing the fight scenes, but again as one should expect, VFX is meh. Now if you cringed during the musical note duel between the two Doctor Strange, then wait till you see one segment of the film where it feels like a misplaced musical. Lots of quirky and annoying humor like one should expect in an MCU film.The Skrulls are in the film and as a fan we always think we can write the better film after watching it, but I just DO NOT understand why this sequel couldn't have been SECRET INVASION(one of the worst MCU Disney+ shows). SECRET INVASION honestly should have been an Avengers film or at the very least a Captain Marvel sequel co-starring some Avengers, kinda like CIVIL WAR. I personally feel like that dilemma could have furthered Captain Marvel's development due to her involvement with them and how she's equally to blame for not helping them out when she and Fury promised to find them a home. But instead she's stuck with this material.The mid-credit scene is arguably the best part. Once again teasing things to come. It's stuff that like that, that will maybe still garner interest in the MCU despite its current fall from grace. The end-credit scene is alright. Not particularly jazzed about that promise down the line.On that note, the recent Variety article published about Marvel Studios talked about their behind the scenes trouble. It was said that Kevin Feige and his creative committee partook in their yearly Palm Springs retreat to regroup and refocus, so here's hoping to next year being more consistent with quality. Seemed like he was spread too thin with the mandate to have more quantity than quality.THE MARVELS is a season 1.5 for MS. MARVEL and a CAPTAIN MARVEL sequel that we never saw due to the flashbacks and exposition to explain things. And let's be clear, at this point everything feels like homework. That was going to be inevitable moving forward after INFINITY WAR and ENDGAMGE, but especially when Disney+ was announced making Kevin Feige spread out too thin. But it only feels like homework because everything that has been released is below the standard of what Marvel set up for us.So to sum it up, while I did find it slightly more appealing than the first CAPTAIN MARVEL and QUANTUMANIA, that isn't saying much. Low expectations definitely helped. Is THE MARVELS one of the worst? No, but it definitely belongs way down below the list.5/10."
"Marvels","tibby_23","17 January 2024",410,"By far the worst Marvel movie so far, I am extremely disappointed. After the mess that Thor 4 was, I was hoping that Marvel learned its lesson, but it seems not. I am honestly happy this movie did bad at the box office, that's what you get for ruining such a great character (I loved Cpt. Marvel from the comics).What makes it bad:
Action moves way too fast from one scene to anotherNo character improvement or growth by the end of the movieThings just happen with no storytellingNot serious enough, too childish for my tasteToo many goofy moments (singing, really? We've come this low, Marvel?)End scenes that try to set the context for next movies seem forced and unnecessaryI also found two good things eventually:
I liked the villain and her story, sympathized with her a bitAt least the movie was not long.These writers should never be hired again."
"Marvels","olcare","10 November 2023",410,"Criticizing specific parts of the movie became confusing for me as there were so many details I wanted to change. This film truly disappointed me, especially since my expectations were already low, and falling below them is a bad sign for Marvel. It had a Thor: Love and Thunder vibe, which I also disliked (4/10). I had been excited after watching Loki in the morning, but it was in vain.For me, the unbearable part was the music. After checking the playlists of movies I've watched for a long time, Marvel had by far the worst compositions. The music was exaggerated, drowning out the impact of fight scenes and making them unbearable. It was like overly noisy background music during a break.Another aspect I didn't like was the main villain. I can't believe Marvel fell into the same mistake again. The villain was poorly written, and Zawe Ashton's performance felt forced, appearing awkward in scenes. One major reason for this was the poor portrayal of the Kree Empire in the MCU. Neglecting the significance of the Kree made Supreme look bad. They could have explained the critical situation of the 'Hala' planet in the film's opening with a 30-35 minute sequence, providing context for the desperation of the Kree.Another thing I found absurd was Monica teleporting to a parallel universe. They portrayed the concept of parallel universes like child's play. Especially after watching Loki Season 2 in the morning, her randomly teleporting or getting stuck in another universe seemed too simplistic.Seeing Professor Beast was surprising and pleasing. The X-Men era is beginning, and despite the poor productions, I'm excited. Brie Larson was good again, carrying her character well. The scene with Monica, Kamala, Danvers vs Dar-Benn was good, thankfully without music. However, despite not being a fan of Kamala Khan, her origin is preserved, and it's not bad. But I feel there's a lack of harmony among our main three characters, and I believe it's a script issue, not an actor one.While I like the idea of saving a planet by traveling through different planets, I didn't like the execution at all. Presenting such a serious and contemporary issue as if it's the simplest thing with childlike music seems somewhat unserious to me.However it turns out, this film paved the way for others and served as a stepping stone. Hopefully, with Beast in Deadpool 3, the overall MCU storyline will improve, abandoning mediocrity urgently; otherwise, it will continue to receive poor ratings.Note: I forgot to mention in the review, but Goose is a fantastic character, and I hope we continue to see this adorable cat. The scene with all the cats was genuinely entertaining, one of the enjoyable moments in 4-5 scenes."
"Marvels","alensufli","8 November 2023",210,"Even writing a review is extremely pointless as we all knew what we were expecting months before but here I am. They even themselves admitted it. The film is a huge disappointment. The plot is all over the place. Actions sequences were sometimes good but sometime were so dumb I didn't know where to look, where to pay attention. I like how they tried to catch the old marvel magic. Yes. They tried. But they utterly failed. Feige pulled off ""wait until the post credit scene to get excited cuz the film itself is boring"" trick again. And it wasn't a ""wow"" for me at least. The theatre was silent throughout and after the film. No one even made a giggling sound. Dead silence. Jokes were landing facedown to the ground every time a character made one. That's right. Every character there is comic relief. And I absolutely don't wanna talk about acting."
"Marvels","S3pt3m63r","18 November 2023",NA,"Unfortunately if you haven't got Disney plus and you don't keep to speed with the tv series, then you this movie won't make much sense as it relies on you knowing what's going on in that universe so far, which I'm not up to date with and involves the Miss Marvels characters which haven't been introduced in the movies. Confusing.I had hoped that following Guardians 3 it could've get much worse for the Marvel universe, at least Guardians has Rocket😂It's hard to find any plot to this movie. Carol Danvers (Captain Marvel) does throw a lot of people through the roof but the plot is a quantum entanglement mess. The movie is blissfully short but feels longer as it's so bad and some people walked out of the theatre. I was so pleasantly when it ended.I think it's about to retire the whole Marvel superhero franchise as this phase is going badly."
"Marvels","nscoby93","10 November 2023",210,"I actually had no intention of watching this film in theaters. Originally, I was just going to wait for its home release on Disney Plus, but after recently rewatching WandaVision, I genuinely wanted to see how they would handle Monica Rambeau and see what they would do with her.So I'll mention the positives for this film first...The movie is actually pretty, I really enjoyed the film aesthetically it looked good. This is very surprising to say as recent Marvel projects are tremendous eye sores.The films central characters, Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) and Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani), were surprisingly good. I had fully anticipated to dislike Captain Marvel and Ms Marvel in this film but I surprisingly enjoyed them both which is a big compliment coming from me, and Monica Rambeau is my favorite of the three she was good as I expected and anticipated. All three actresses gave enjoyable performances, and they all worked well together on screen.Then, of course, Samuel Jackson is always great! And the return of everyone's favorite Flerken kitty Goose. She had a great sequence that I refuse to spoil, but it had me dying. Goose saved this film!And well that's it...This film is just bad. Bad writing, bad pacing, bad storytelling. Nothing in this film is properly set up as it rushes through its 1 hour and 45 minute run time. Which is quite frankly fine for me as I genuinely did not want more of this.This movie as a whole is just overwhelmingly safe. It has no stakes, takes no risks, and does nothing. But there is actual enjoyment in its failings. It was so bad that it was good. The amount of eye rolling, face palms, and sighs I gave through this film was astonishing. I gave up on this film within the first 30 minutes, and afterward, that's when the enjoyment began because of how bad it went on to be.Then suddenly, out of nowhere, the film became a musical? Like what is happening? This film is so chaotic and unstructured. It just never stopped.The film had a good mid-credit scene so you know stay for that. Unfortunately, it was spoiled for me, so it didn't hit as hard as it could have. Especially if you're a fan of the actor who originally played the character the scene introduces.But The Marvels was exactly what I anticipated it to be, a below average dump. Which is a shame because they play with some interesting concepts in this film, but they do nothing with them, or they are just poorly handled. I can at least say I didn't hate this movie. Unfortunately, I just enjoyed it for all the wrong reasons.IMDb: 3/10

"Marvels","brentsbulletinboard","11 November 2023",510,"When I first heard the title of this movie, I thought it was about a 1960s girls' singing group. And, frankly, that would have probably made for a better movie. Writer-director Nia DaCosta's third feature outing and the latest in the Marvel Universe paradigm is a wildly inconsistent superhero movie that tries too hard to do too much and doesn't have a script to support it. Too many of its plot elements aren't adequately explained until well into the story, while others aren't explained at all, leaving viewers who aren't comic book laureates wondering what's going on (particularly at film's end). Meanwhile, other narrative aspects frequently appear gimmicky and grow old quickly, such as the introduction of the primary superpower that its three protagonists share, one that almost becomes slapstickish after an all-too-brief while. On top of that, the CGI effects vacillate from one end of the quality spectrum to the other, creating a mix of images that are either startling to look at or stunningly cheesy at best. Add to that a villain that isn't particularly menacing, along with attempts at humor that either succeed brilliantly (cat lovers take note) or fall flat and look incredibly lame (as aficionados of musical theater will undoubtedly attest), all of which further add to the picture's pervasive inconsistency. The inclusion of ample clues for advancing the overarching Marvel Universe storyline continues here, too, furthering a trend that's growing tiresome in the studio's releases, a development akin to the ""Paul is dead"" legacy come to life with every passing picture. Then there's the trio of heroes themselves, who often appear more like they've been plucked from a giddy slumber party flick or a Cyndi Lauper video than taking center stage as seriously empowered champions in an action-adventure offering. All of these failings combine to make this production more of a forgettable placeholder in the Marvel mythology than a standalone feature (not to mention a pale substitute for a sequel to the far-superior film that launched the Captain Marvel franchise in 2019). In short, ""The Marvels"" is as much of a mess as it is a movie, and that's troubling for several reasons. It lends credence to the growing criticism that films like this aren't to be taken seriously. It reinforces the notion that they're cookie-cutter in nature, easily interchangeable with one another. And it raises questions about the career choices of lead actress Brie Larson, who, though quite capable of playing roles like these, is running the risk of becoming type-cast, a troubling prospect for an Academy Award-winning actress who possesses a depth of talent and is handily adept at taking on better and more serious material than this. In the wake of this release, Marvel Studios should take a step back and seriously assess where its future is headed, especially if movies like this are any indication. As pictures like ""Wakanda Forever"" (2022) show, the studio is capable of better work - and it's time to show viewers that."
"Marvels","Sleepin_Dragon","10 November 2023",410,"Carol Danvers is attempting to save the universe, but her incredible powers become entangled with those of Kamala Khan and Monica Rambeau, they must unite to save the world.Ouch, what can you say, this is surely one of Marvel's lowest points, I honestly don't know who the target audience is, or who this is going to appeal to, young teens only maybe? Anyhow, this was an absolute mess.The writing was clearly problematic, it doesn't gel, it is genuinely all over the place. I do very much wonder if huge sections of this film cut? It can be the only answer, it just doesn't flow at all, and that short run time...Special effects, some were pretty good, some were poor, I just wish there was a greater focus on plot, it just seemed like 100 minutes of CGI, noise and random events.Brie Larson, I'm not sure about you, but to me she looked totally disinterested and bored by the whole thing, what I didn't see, was someone committed to the role. I thought Samuel Jackson was rather good, but again poorly served by the script.It didn't look great from the trailers, and in reality, it's another clunker from Marvel Studios.4/10."

I also loved Wanda Vision and the introduction of Monica Rambeau and I was hoping for at least a good continuation of her story. I didn't watch Ms. Marvel because I'm not a teen and I knew it wasn't for me; and after watching her parts in this movie I'm glad I stuck to that.All three actresses are good and of course Samuel L in always a pleasure to see, but none of the other characters including the so-called villain were the least bit interesting. Most of the scenes were just downright silly. I hope they continue Monica's story with better writing and I wish Marvel would stop being silly and go back to making movies for adults and kids."
"Marvels","isaacsundaralingam","11 November 2023",310,"The MCU has absolutely overstayed its welcome. Post Avengers Endgame, these projects have been feeling more and more like content than cinema (except the rare surprises like GOTG 3). Superhero fatigue, they call it and this movie does practically nothing but to amp it up to 11.You watch the trailer, you know what happens. You bet on originality, you end up homeless. There's nothing new for me to say that I haven't already said about any of the other MCU content as of late. It's so generic that I'm confident a year from now, no one would remember this movie even existed. With every new MCU project, the jokes-per-minute ratio keeps getting worse, the villains are a writer's version of a stock photograph (I can't even remember the villain's name in this movie and it hasn't even been a day since I watched it), the CGI is so out there you can almost see the CGI artists' tears on screen, and it's getting more and more difficult to tell each MCU project apart cos they're all just the same.The only few positives I can identify here are actresses Iman Vellani and Brie Larson (Larson, who seems much more relaxed and settled into her superhero boots), and maybe the flashy action sequences. Otherwise, there's nothing here to watch, nothing here to experience and nothing here to enjoy. What a shame."
"Marvels","MrDHWong","9 November 2023",410,"""The Marvels"" is the sequel to 2019's ""Captain Marvel"", a continuation of the Disney+ series ""Ms. Marvel"", and the 33rd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris, and Iman Vellani, it represents a painful look at the downward spiral the MCU has found itself caught in since the end of Phase 3.Sometime after the events of ""Captain Marvel"", Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) has unintentionally started a civil war among the alien race known as the Kree. The leader of the Kree, Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton), soon finds one half of the Quantum Bands and later seeks out the other half, which is in the possession of Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel (Iman Vellani). At the request of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Carol teams up with Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) to negotiate peace among the Kree, but as the two investigate a wormhole in outer space, Monica, Carol, and Kamala start mysteriously switching powers with one another. Realising something is amiss, the trio are forced to work together to figure out what is causing this strange phenomena and hopefully put a stop to both Dar-Benn and the warring Kree.It's becoming harder and harder to call myself fan of the MCU, given the array of serviceable to terrible projects they have been churning out lately. To be fair though, it is a tall order to top something as ambitious as the culmination of over ten years worth of universe building after both ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and ""Avengers: Endgame"" pulled it off so effectively years ago. For the longest time, I have been willing to defend the post-Endgame MCU for trying different things, as I was under the impression that all of this would be leading to exciting new projects on the horizon. However, after sitting through ""The Marvels"", I can say with a hint of heartbreak that practically all of my optimism for the MCU's future has all but disappeared, as it contains next to nothing worth defending from a creative standpoint.Perhaps the best way to describe my viewing experience with this film would be ""apathetic"", because at no point does it ever feel like anything important is at stake. This is mainly due to either our three heroes being too overpowered or there not being enough information provided about the ones who need saving. Whenever a horde of enemies are swarming the trio, we watch as the three of them effortlessly take them out without even breaking a sweat. Action-packed moments like these that once elicited excitement have now been reduced to a series of bland fistfights and generic CGI blasts that have all been done before in better MCU films.We see Carol Danvers quickly blast everyone away with her energy beams and block punches with her hands, never once showing any signs that she is in real danger. Her accomplice Monica Rambeau does pretty much the same thing, only with less time on screen. Even Kamala Khan, who is the biggest fish-out-of-water in this situation, has no major trouble dealing with foes coming at her from every angle, always using her half of the Quantum Band to her advantage. How is it possible to keep the audience on their toes if the enemy forces are so inefficient that even an inexperienced child can wipe the floor with them this easily? On that note, it also doesn't help that none of these three heroes appear to have any physical weaknesses or personal insecurities holding them back, which causes all of the tension to evaporate instantly.In addition to this, we are barely shown anything interesting about the Kree that will keep the audience invested in their role in the story. As far as the film is concerned, they are nothing more than a stock species of extraterrestrials that are causing problems simply because the plot demands it. The original ""Captain Marvel"" film established that the Kree were the ones who inadvertently gave Carol her powers and took her in among them. Yet, this film never reminds the audience of that, instead opting to throw them right into the thick of the conflict without any important context. As a result, I just did not care at all about what happened to any of these people.It's also worth mentioning that this film is rife with obvious re-edits and tonal inconsistencies. One scene where this is most evident is where Carol Danvers is opening up to both Rambeau and Khan about her relationship with the Kree. What could have been a good method of showcasing Danvers's humanity is instead brushed aside for something completely unrelated after less than two minutes. I couldn't help but assume that this scene was supposed to go on much longer but was cut in post production for whatever reason. To add insult to injury, the scene is then immediately followed by a strange attempt at comic relief which fails to raise even a single laugh. Although Marvel films are known for their blending of comedy with drama, a moment like this felt like a rather tacky addition to the film that only hampers the already poor narrative structure. Worse still, there are other similar occurrences like this throughout the rest of the story.One of the biggest problems with the original ""Captain Marvel"" film was how weakly written the title character was, with her lack of likeable character traits and overly serious demeanour being a major reason why she is not viewed favourably by fans. You'd expect the filmmakers to remedy this problem for the sequel, but you would be wrong. I'm not sure whether it's Brie Larson's underwhelming performance or just plain old bad writing but I have never once felt any fondness for Carol Danvers as a person. As mentioned above, she efficiently fights her way through many bad guys with no issue whatsoever, never once showing any emotional weakness or other potential vulnerabilities. Because of this, Carol Danvers never feels like a real person, being nothing more than a one-dimensional superhero that is practically impossible for anybody to identify with. Her character has not changed or grown since the first film, and it looks like she won't be doing so anytime soon.I keep trying to remind myself of Monica Rambeau's contribution to the story but nothing memorable ever comes to mind without doing some kind of online research. Like Brie Larson, there is nothing especially remarkable about Teyonah Parris's performance, as her character is as bland as she comes. Though it is established that Rambeau looked up to Carol Danvers as a child, her role in this story is nothing more than playing second fiddle to an already dull lead protagonist. Yes, Rambeau is very strong and yes, she is more than capable of taking care of herself in a fight, but beyond that what else does she offer? Most of the time she just goes along with Danvers's orders without ever questioning her or giving her personal opinions, making her nothing more than a blind follower. I was hoping to have seen some kind of opposing dynamic between Danvers and Rambeau, as that would have given their characters an important amount of depth the distinguish the two from one another. No such luck I'm afraid.The only character I sort of cared about was Kamala Khan, whose childlike naiveté made her the most relatable of the three leads. In her feature film debut, Iman Vellani does carry over many of Khan's human traits from the Disney+ series ""Ms. Marvel"", being that she's still young and coming to terms with mastering her powers. Unfortunately, she does not achieve this through the character herself, but rather due to how woefully underwritten her two co-stars are in comparison. I wanted to see the three as kindred spirits, fighting as trio but standing out as individuals. Instead, all we get are two dull, stoic, overpowered adults and a young kid working together for no other reason than because the writers said so.As depressing as it sounds, the once mighty MCU is showing no signs of improvement as ""The Marvels"" just may be the worst film in the series so far. There simply isn't enough reason to justify its existence outside of some kind of contractual obligation by the higher ups at Disney, and I fully respect many people's decision to skip it altogether. At this point, I seriously doubt the MCU can ever return to its former glory, as this film is set to become the series' biggest box office bomb to date. I can only hope in vain that Disney will learn an important lesson from this film's failure, but knowing their track record that seems unlikely.I rate it 4/10."
"Marvels","danieljfarthing","9 January 2024",110,"2019's ""Captain Marvel"" wasn't too bad, for a superhero movie, but its sequel ""The Marvels"" is an unmitigated stinking disaster - the WORST Marvel movie to date (which is saying something). Set a decade or two after the original, Brie Larson (via Samuel L Jackson) teams somewhat inadvertently with Teyonah Parris & Iman Vellani (awful) to save Gary Lewis' people (what happened to previous leader Ben Mendelsohn?!) from evil Zawe Ashton. Director Nia DaCosta (who also co-wrote this tripe with Megan McDonnell & Elissa Karasik) creates a headache inducing, fast (as if bizarrely sped up), frantic, thoroughly annoying, tiresome piece of garbage. Absolutely dreadful."
"Marvels","altugozhan","12 November 2023",210,"I just want to know who is responsible for MCUs phase 4 and how he or she can still be employedThere are 0(zero) good movies and only 1 or 2 tv shows that are watchable over a total of 20 productions and this is one of the bottom ranked ones. Marvel did a fantastic job over the decade, earned trust of fans besides billions of dollars and they are wasting it like there is no tomorrow.I don't know how a franchise can change so drastically from hero to zero.I have watched every marvel movie out there and this is equally as bad as she-hulk.Story is definitely boring, protagonists are boring, antagonist is boring, action is boring, battles are boring, some scenes are absurd and ridiculous.I have absolutely nothing good to say about this movie. Don't waste your money or your time.Looks like the movie is only made to make money in India."
"Marvels","ThereelscoopwithKK","10 November 2023",110,"This second installment makes the original Captain Marvel look like a cinematic masterpiece... Nothing about this movie works. Although Brie Larson's acting has improved over the years it feels like she doesn't want to be there for this at all. Further, when you break it down, there is really no story at all happening. In fact, the solution to the entire problem is so extremely simple and solvable that you really wonder why there was a conflict in the first place. So much of everything is unexplained and eventually you stop trying to figure it out because you eventually lose all interest . Samuel L Jackson's character , Nick Fury, is hardly even a shell of his former self and is essentially now demoted to comedic relief.The scenes don't really mesh together at all. None of them are really necessary to advancing a plot and all feature the same repeated choreographic battle. The villain lacks any real charisma and is only provided a very brief backstory. Overall she never feels like too much of a threat.There's one part in particular that I think is absolutely a candidate for worst sequence of 2023. Without spoiling it , it is essentially a planet that looks like a cheap rip off of the Wizard of Oz. It just captures all of the problems with this movie into one scene. There's been a lot of less than stellar work from Marvel since endgame, but this is reaching new depths.I'm not even going to get started on the cats scene with the theme song....Please Loki, reset the entire timeline."
"Marvels","Avwillfan89","23 December 2023",110,"This film is somehow way more depressing and worse than Ant Man Quantumania. We honestly thought Eternals was bad, but that was only the beginning. It was only going to go downhill from there.Watching this movie felt like watching a beloved friend in a coma fighting for her life. It was sad, frustrating and ultimately hopeless. So much potential squandered right before our very eyes.Much has been said about the Girl Power aspect of this story, but it doesn't mean jack when the characters are so thinly written. After the big character tension build up between Carol and Monica, with the latter resenting her for not coming back, their fractures mend themselves very quickly. There is no chemistry between the the two at all.The villain is Bland with a capitol B, and highly forgettable.Nick Fury is actually pathetic in this movie. He doesn't at all act like the Fury we know and love. He was more in character in Far From Home when Talos was impersonating him!I don't think I've ever had this much of a bad experience with a film since Cats. And it is telling that there actually features a ludicrous scene involving baby flerkens and the song Memory.What the actual hell, Marvel?The only good thing is that it is mercifully short, and Iman Vellani does seem to be enjoying herself in the role.Once a great studio, brought crumbling down on itself. If I could give it zero stars, I would."
"Marvels","chenp-54708","10 November 2023",210,"Marvel movies really have fallen apart haven't they? This is definitely one of the worst Marvels movie I have seen out of all the Marvel movies I had watched. There really isn't too much to say about the movie because ""The Marvels"" is pretty much like almost every single Marvel movie but the writing, humor, direction, and performances are pretty much all over the place. Director Nia DaCosta has made ""Little Woods"" which I liked but her direction here is pretty bad and goes all over the place.The special effects are kind of rough on the edges, the actions and thrills were just okay and the performances, despite a pretty good cast, they aren't very good. Brie Larson is an actress I like but unfortunately her performance felt weak and lacking. The other performances as well including the child performances. The story isn't interesting as the writing is pretty bland and none of the characters were interesting. With a short runtime, the movie surprisingly was really boring.I do like superhero movies but it seems this one really just sucked. Overall, it's bad."
"Marvels","kevin_robbins","12 November 2023",310,"My wife and I recently caught Marvel's (2023) in theaters. The plot revolves around Captain Marvel's mistake in choosing sides during a battle, disrupting the cosmic balance. Two young ladies gain powers in the process, and Captain Marvel must collaborate with them to rectify her error and restore equilibrium to the universe.Directed by Nia DaCosta (Candyman) and featuring Brie Larson (Lessons in Chemistry), Teyonah Parris (Dear White People), Iman Vellani (Ms. Marvel), Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction), and Zawe Ashton (Blitz).This film boasts clean and classic Marvel-style characters, cinematography, action scenes, and special effects. However, the plot seems somewhat lackluster, with Captain Marvel possibly appearing more as a villain than a hero. The backstories of the heroes lack sufficient development, making it challenging to form a connection with them. The cat steals the show initially but feels overdone by the end, and even Samuel L. Jackson's wit falls short of expectations.In summary, this superhero movie prioritizes its message over a compelling storyline. While the characters and visuals are in line with Marvel's trademark style, the plot may leave audiences indifferent. The lack of character depth and an engaging storyline earns this film a 3/10, making it a skip-worthy experience."
"Marvels","SHU_Movies","10 November 2023",310,"Going from the Loki Series Finale this morning to The Marvels this evening was (for lack of a better word) bonkers! The finale was perfect, and a beautiful ending to the show, while The Marvels is a complete mess. It's honestly given me whiplashThe Marvels is just an all-around bad movie. The script is awful and the story is super rushed and poorly executed, which both have an impact on how well the characters (and in-turn the actors) come-across on-screenThe action and humour are kind of alright, and the VFX are definitely better than anything we've seen in an MCU project since Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness (with the obvious exceptions of Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 and Loki Season 2), but that still doesn't exactly make it look greatThis movie is just painful to watch at points! Early on, it has some really fun moments, and felt like it could have actually been somewhat entertaining, but that feeling vanished as soon as it came. It's barley better than Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania, so you can do with that information what you will."
"Marvels","NanoFrog","16 January 2024",110,"So Stan Lee passes away and we get Disney now in full control of Marvel stories...and boy is there a difference. I could not finish watching this really bad film, it is just junk from scene to scene. The cast, I feel so sorry for them because the cast is a fine group for the most part...but the story, the effects, the directing are all jumbled up into a real mess. The premise is interesting but they have no idea what to do with it. I have never been a fan of Disney, maybe when I was 10 years old, back in the early 60s, but this is not at all Walt Disney. This is Disney INC and a massive number of talentless paperwork and book-keepers make their films these days. This is just junk slammed together by people who have no idea how to tell a story or stage intelligent effects. This film is not a Turkey, it is, in fact, just garbage. RIP MArvel."
"Marvels","OnlyAtJMart","12 November 2023",410,"Anyone who heard the news about this project knows that the production was a nightmare, and it shows in the final product here. It's like they couldn't figure out what direction to go, so they made 4 versions, and blended them together. Which would explain the high budget, the 5 delays, and the reshoots. Kamala's character was probably the best part of the movie. I promise you, the script did her no favors, but she stood out. Her acting was in line with her character. This was probably an exciting opportunity for her, and she wasn't going to let a bad script, and production problems stop her from giving a great effort. However, the story, the dialogue, the musical gimmick, the weak villain. It just didn't work. I don't think the blame lies solely with the actors, or even the director, who did lack the experience for helming a movie with a budget this size. I think Disney interfered heavily with the production, which almost always yields bad results. I think it was doomed to fail. They put so much pressure on this being successful, they forgot to make it coherent, unique, or interesting."
"Marvels","mildlyintrusive","13 November 2023",210,"Once in a while I tend to go to my local theater to check out something new, maybe a new release or a re-run of a movie. Today, I stumbled upon The Marvels, I thought ""Hey, I haven't been going to the theater this month that often, maybe I should try this out?"" And well, it seems that I'd made the wrong decision. The Marvels follows the titular Marvels trying to stop an evil Kree with one disadvantage however, every time they use their powers, it's Freaky Friday.Maybe its because of the very troubled production but everything just feels like an amalgamation of three separate movies, its like a ADHD experience. The movie does NOT take itself seriously at all, and as a result, it makes me hard to care for literally everything! Its like a circus act masquerading as a movie, it doesn't work! There were moments where characters were in danger and they start joking about it every opportunity they get. To add insult to injury was the treatment of the character of Nick Fury, who feels like a completely different character altogether, cracking lame after lame jokes every single time! Special effects were decent, but considering the massive 271M+ budget I wished they could've at least cared about the plot and flesh out some if the characters and their motivations instead of relying on action scene after action scene, it gets tiring after a while you know?Brie Larson herself looks tired and forced in this movie, her character also being this girl-boss who can sweep through enemies in this movie, no weaknesses and no vulnerabilities. It all feels so one-dimensional, it tries to be like a 80s action star with the likes of Arnold and co. But fails because they lack charisma and charm. Because of this I found it impossible to relate to her in any sense of way. Monica Rambeau wasn't trying her best here, and there is no opposing dynamic between the two to the point where I found her virtually indistinguishable from Mrs. Danvers herself. However I do commend Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan, whose child-like personality I was comfortable with and is the standout between the three leads but suffers from being very underwritten and the villain is a copy-and-paste from dozens we've seen before.Overall, a messy and disjointed movie with not much to offer rather than annoying, dreadful humor and some few flashy action scenes. It certainly feels like homework for the MCU as it struggles to keep a hook in something after the Infinity Saga. Skip this one and play with your action figures instead, Im sure it'll be better than this."
"Marvels","critic-97-417657","4 February 2024",810,"The movie was somewhat ridiculous, but I found myself giggling throughout it. It was actually quite fun. There were a lot of really charming things about this movie, and while the storyline lacked any real tension, I didn't really care. It was mostly about the character development, and the relationships between the three main characters. Overall, I just found it really fun and just didn't take it very seriously. In a lot of ways, it is a set up for the rest of the series, and is definitely not a standalone movie. And the post credit scene, amazing. Ties in a lot of potential for what they are going to be doing in this franchise."
"Marvels","The-Sarkologist","7 February 2024",710,"Well, I guess someone was right when they said that one of the big problems with this film was that you had to like watch 8 other films and 3 series to sort of understand what was going on. Mind you, I have actually done just that, but even then with the amount of time that had passed since I watched the other things it was still a little tricky understanding what was happening.Mind you, I did actually quite like the film. Like the scenes where they were switching places whenever they used their powers together, and also the big bad in the film, that was in part trying to save her people, but also attempting to punish Captain Marvel for what she had done to her people. Yeah, as it turned out, when she destroyed the great intelligence it sent the Kree into a massive civil war which basically destroyed their planet.So, if you had seen Miss Marvel, you will know that she has a thing for Captain Marvel, and of course it was always going to be a thing that she was eventually going to be involved in a team up. Also, there were some hints at the end that suggested that there was going to be another team-up film, though apparently that will still be some way off (and the problem will be that, no doubt, when they get around to it, all of them will be too old to be members of a possible Young Avengers - kids do grow up a little too fast).Yeah, I thought that this film was pretty good, though I have to agree that the problem is that you do need to catch up to speed to understand what is going on. Oh, it also seemed that it felt that it was a bit over the place, no doubt because they wanted to make the film shorter than a lot of the others. Still, it's good, especially if you are up to date on the films."
"Marvels","cherold","30 January 2024",710,"After the bad reviews, and considering how many bad superhero movies have come out lately, I would have skipped this one if the trailer didn't look like so much fun. Fortunately, the movie fulfills the trailer's promiseIn the movie, three superheroes with related powers find themselves suddenly swapping places with one another. The proves to be a good gimmick for both action and comedy, as the three keep finding themselves in one another's battles. Eventually, they master the situation in order to take down a very angry villain with an unusually sympathetic backstory.The movie leans heavily - and for the most part successfully - into the comedy. A big chunk of this is fueled by the teenage Captain Marvel fangirl Ms. Marvel, who is from a TV series I found too pre-teen-oriented to enjoy. Ms. Marvel's an annoying character but for the most part I found her amusing in this.There's also a funny gag with alien cats.While I enjoyed this movie, I have to admit its a bit of an unfocussed mess. There are a lot of elements just tossed in, like a whole thing with Marvel #3, Monica, dealing with her abandonment issues. These occasional ""emotional"" moments don't much interest me.Anyway, a lot of people hate this, but if you like the trailer, I'd say chance the movie (I did not take a chance on the last Aquaman movie because unlike The Marvels, the trailer looked just as bad as people said the movie was.Going against the current, I say if you want a bunch of comedy and some fun action then you should watch this one."
"Marvels","drawlife","8 November 2023",510,"THE MARVELS is here and it's a mashed up film that is totally all over the place. It feels as if this film was edited and chopped into pieces during post and it shows.Couple things I enjoyed, I did like seeing Carol Danvers and Monica Rambeau resolve and acknowledge their relationship, but due to the nature of their characters being straight arrows, it allows Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan to be the audience just as Tom Holland's Peter Parker was in CIVIL WAR. I did not particularly enjoy the MS. MARVEL series, but I can see her being the shoutout for many.I think the script just touched on the surface of Brie Larson's Captain Marvel herself, so diving into her more is a plus, however the story did her no favors once again and I did feel like she was given like four or five pieces of direction to portray her character compared to the more one-note performance in the first film. Teyonah Parris is commendable. She was the more science-y of the trio.Samuel L. Jackson just feels inconsistent especially after SECRET INVASION. Feels like this Nick Fury is a variant. He's simply passing through in this film.Another thing I liked was the incursions (also briefly touched on in DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS). We all complained about the lack of planting seeds for the future leading into KANG DYNASTY and SECRET WARS. Finally, this film it at least preps and teases what's to come down the line.The MCU's villain problem is a long known fact, but here it only cements their problem even further. Now I'm a fan of Lee Pace's over the top performance as Ronan, but Dar-Benn played by Zawe Ashton is literally a copy and paste of Ronan, but female. Nothing new about it. Definitely up there as one of the worst villains in the MCU.The power swaps were kinda cool so I can give it that. Nia DaCosta does a good job executing the fight scenes, but again as one should expect, VFX is meh. Now if you cringed during the musical note duel between the two Doctor Strange, then wait till you see one segment of the film where it feels like a misplaced musical. Lots of quirky and annoying humor like one should expect in an MCU film.The Skrulls are in the film and as a fan we always think we can write the better film after watching it, but I just DO NOT understand why this sequel couldn't have been SECRET INVASION(one of the worst MCU Disney+ shows). SECRET INVASION honestly should have been an Avengers film or at the very least a Captain Marvel sequel co-starring some Avengers, kinda like CIVIL WAR. I personally feel like that dilemma could have furthered Captain Marvel's development due to her involvement with them and how she's equally to blame for not helping them out when she and Fury promised to find them a home. But instead she's stuck with this material.The mid-credit scene is arguably the best part. Once again teasing things to come. It's stuff that like that, that will maybe still garner interest in the MCU despite its current fall from grace. The end-credit scene is alright. Not particularly jazzed about that promise down the line.On that note, the recent Variety article published about Marvel Studios talked about their behind the scenes trouble. It was said that Kevin Feige and his creative committee partook in their yearly Palm Springs retreat to regroup and refocus, so here's hoping to next year being more consistent with quality. Seemed like he was spread too thin with the mandate to have more quantity than quality.THE MARVELS is a season 1.5 for MS. MARVEL and a CAPTAIN MARVEL sequel that we never saw due to the flashbacks and exposition to explain things. And let's be clear, at this point everything feels like homework. That was going to be inevitable moving forward after INFINITY WAR and ENDGAMGE, but especially when Disney+ was announced making Kevin Feige spread out too thin. But it only feels like homework because everything that has been released is below the standard of what Marvel set up for us.So to sum it up, while I did find it slightly more appealing than the first CAPTAIN MARVEL and QUANTUMANIA, that isn't saying much. Low expectations definitely helped. Is THE MARVELS one of the worst? No, but it definitely belongs way down below the list.5/10."
"Marvels","tibby_23","17 January 2024",410,"By far the worst Marvel movie so far, I am extremely disappointed. After the mess that Thor 4 was, I was hoping that Marvel learned its lesson, but it seems not. I am honestly happy this movie did bad at the box office, that's what you get for ruining such a great character (I loved Cpt. Marvel from the comics).What makes it bad:
Action moves way too fast from one scene to anotherNo character improvement or growth by the end of the movieThings just happen with no storytellingNot serious enough, too childish for my tasteToo many goofy moments (singing, really? We've come this low, Marvel?)End scenes that try to set the context for next movies seem forced and unnecessaryI also found two good things eventually:
I liked the villain and her story, sympathized with her a bitAt least the movie was not long.These writers should never be hired again."
"Marvels","olcare","10 November 2023",410,"Criticizing specific parts of the movie became confusing for me as there were so many details I wanted to change. This film truly disappointed me, especially since my expectations were already low, and falling below them is a bad sign for Marvel. It had a Thor: Love and Thunder vibe, which I also disliked (4/10). I had been excited after watching Loki in the morning, but it was in vain.For me, the unbearable part was the music. After checking the playlists of movies I've watched for a long time, Marvel had by far the worst compositions. The music was exaggerated, drowning out the impact of fight scenes and making them unbearable. It was like overly noisy background music during a break.Another aspect I didn't like was the main villain. I can't believe Marvel fell into the same mistake again. The villain was poorly written, and Zawe Ashton's performance felt forced, appearing awkward in scenes. One major reason for this was the poor portrayal of the Kree Empire in the MCU. Neglecting the significance of the Kree made Supreme look bad. They could have explained the critical situation of the 'Hala' planet in the film's opening with a 30-35 minute sequence, providing context for the desperation of the Kree.Another thing I found absurd was Monica teleporting to a parallel universe. They portrayed the concept of parallel universes like child's play. Especially after watching Loki Season 2 in the morning, her randomly teleporting or getting stuck in another universe seemed too simplistic.Seeing Professor Beast was surprising and pleasing. The X-Men era is beginning, and despite the poor productions, I'm excited. Brie Larson was good again, carrying her character well. The scene with Monica, Kamala, Danvers vs Dar-Benn was good, thankfully without music. However, despite not being a fan of Kamala Khan, her origin is preserved, and it's not bad. But I feel there's a lack of harmony among our main three characters, and I believe it's a script issue, not an actor one.While I like the idea of saving a planet by traveling through different planets, I didn't like the execution at all. Presenting such a serious and contemporary issue as if it's the simplest thing with childlike music seems somewhat unserious to me.However it turns out, this film paved the way for others and served as a stepping stone. Hopefully, with Beast in Deadpool 3, the overall MCU storyline will improve, abandoning mediocrity urgently; otherwise, it will continue to receive poor ratings.Note: I forgot to mention in the review, but Goose is a fantastic character, and I hope we continue to see this adorable cat. The scene with all the cats was genuinely entertaining, one of the enjoyable moments in 4-5 scenes."
"Marvels","alensufli","8 November 2023",210,"Even writing a review is extremely pointless as we all knew what we were expecting months before but here I am. They even themselves admitted it. The film is a huge disappointment. The plot is all over the place. Actions sequences were sometimes good but sometime were so dumb I didn't know where to look, where to pay attention. I like how they tried to catch the old marvel magic. Yes. They tried. But they utterly failed. Feige pulled off ""wait until the post credit scene to get excited cuz the film itself is boring"" trick again. And it wasn't a ""wow"" for me at least. The theatre was silent throughout and after the film. No one even made a giggling sound. Dead silence. Jokes were landing facedown to the ground every time a character made one. That's right. Every character there is comic relief. And I absolutely don't wanna talk about acting."
"Marvels","S3pt3m63r","18 November 2023",NA,"Unfortunately if you haven't got Disney plus and you don't keep to speed with the tv series, then you this movie won't make much sense as it relies on you knowing what's going on in that universe so far, which I'm not up to date with and involves the Miss Marvels characters which haven't been introduced in the movies. Confusing.I had hoped that following Guardians 3 it could've get much worse for the Marvel universe, at least Guardians has Rocket😂It's hard to find any plot to this movie. Carol Danvers (Captain Marvel) does throw a lot of people through the roof but the plot is a quantum entanglement mess. The movie is blissfully short but feels longer as it's so bad and some people walked out of the theatre. I was so pleasantly when it ended.I think it's about to retire the whole Marvel superhero franchise as this phase is going badly."
"Marvels","nscoby93","10 November 2023",210,"I actually had no intention of watching this film in theaters. Originally, I was just going to wait for its home release on Disney Plus, but after recently rewatching WandaVision, I genuinely wanted to see how they would handle Monica Rambeau and see what they would do with her.So I'll mention the positives for this film first...The movie is actually pretty, I really enjoyed the film aesthetically it looked good. This is very surprising to say as recent Marvel projects are tremendous eye sores.The films central characters, Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) and Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani), were surprisingly good. I had fully anticipated to dislike Captain Marvel and Ms Marvel in this film but I surprisingly enjoyed them both which is a big compliment coming from me, and Monica Rambeau is my favorite of the three she was good as I expected and anticipated. All three actresses gave enjoyable performances, and they all worked well together on screen.Then, of course, Samuel Jackson is always great! And the return of everyone's favorite Flerken kitty Goose. She had a great sequence that I refuse to spoil, but it had me dying. Goose saved this film!And well that's it...This film is just bad. Bad writing, bad pacing, bad storytelling. Nothing in this film is properly set up as it rushes through its 1 hour and 45 minute run time. Which is quite frankly fine for me as I genuinely did not want more of this.This movie as a whole is just overwhelmingly safe. It has no stakes, takes no risks, and does nothing. But there is actual enjoyment in its failings. It was so bad that it was good. The amount of eye rolling, face palms, and sighs I gave through this film was astonishing. I gave up on this film within the first 30 minutes, and afterward, that's when the enjoyment began because of how bad it went on to be.Then suddenly, out of nowhere, the film became a musical? Like what is happening? This film is so chaotic and unstructured. It just never stopped.The film had a good mid-credit scene so you know stay for that. Unfortunately, it was spoiled for me, so it didn't hit as hard as it could have. Especially if you're a fan of the actor who originally played the character the scene introduces.But The Marvels was exactly what I anticipated it to be, a below average dump. Which is a shame because they play with some interesting concepts in this film, but they do nothing with them, or they are just poorly handled. I can at least say I didn't hate this movie. Unfortunately, I just enjoyed it for all the wrong reasons.IMDb: 3/10
Letterboxd: 2/5Watched in Theaters."
"Marvels","Rabid_dog-sr","6 February 2024",810,"This is a fun movie, it ties two TV shows into the lore and does a good job of having fun.Does it add anything to the overall Narative, no!Does it highight Ms Marvel as a fun addition, hell yes. Once you get over its not adding anything or revealing any easter eggs, you can enjoy it for what it is.All three main characters deliver on their role, and it improves on captain marvels solo outing. Sit down take any preconceived ideas you have, remove any anticipation of easter eggs and enjoy it for what it is.Has marvel lost its way, yes. Have the glorious days of intertwined writing and on screen narrative been left behind, yes, but as a movie its fun."
"Marvels","brentsbulletinboard","11 November 2023",510,"When I first heard the title of this movie, I thought it was about a 1960s girls' singing group. And, frankly, that would have probably made for a better movie. Writer-director Nia DaCosta's third feature outing and the latest in the Marvel Universe paradigm is a wildly inconsistent superhero movie that tries too hard to do too much and doesn't have a script to support it. Too many of its plot elements aren't adequately explained until well into the story, while others aren't explained at all, leaving viewers who aren't comic book laureates wondering what's going on (particularly at film's end). Meanwhile, other narrative aspects frequently appear gimmicky and grow old quickly, such as the introduction of the primary superpower that its three protagonists share, one that almost becomes slapstickish after an all-too-brief while. On top of that, the CGI effects vacillate from one end of the quality spectrum to the other, creating a mix of images that are either startling to look at or stunningly cheesy at best. Add to that a villain that isn't particularly menacing, along with attempts at humor that either succeed brilliantly (cat lovers take note) or fall flat and look incredibly lame (as aficionados of musical theater will undoubtedly attest), all of which further add to the picture's pervasive inconsistency. The inclusion of ample clues for advancing the overarching Marvel Universe storyline continues here, too, furthering a trend that's growing tiresome in the studio's releases, a development akin to the ""Paul is dead"" legacy come to life with every passing picture. Then there's the trio of heroes themselves, who often appear more like they've been plucked from a giddy slumber party flick or a Cyndi Lauper video than taking center stage as seriously empowered champions in an action-adventure offering. All of these failings combine to make this production more of a forgettable placeholder in the Marvel mythology than a standalone feature (not to mention a pale substitute for a sequel to the far-superior film that launched the Captain Marvel franchise in 2019). In short, ""The Marvels"" is as much of a mess as it is a movie, and that's troubling for several reasons. It lends credence to the growing criticism that films like this aren't to be taken seriously. It reinforces the notion that they're cookie-cutter in nature, easily interchangeable with one another. And it raises questions about the career choices of lead actress Brie Larson, who, though quite capable of playing roles like these, is running the risk of becoming type-cast, a troubling prospect for an Academy Award-winning actress who possesses a depth of talent and is handily adept at taking on better and more serious material than this. In the wake of this release, Marvel Studios should take a step back and seriously assess where its future is headed, especially if movies like this are any indication. As pictures like ""Wakanda Forever"" (2022) show, the studio is capable of better work - and it's time to show viewers that."
